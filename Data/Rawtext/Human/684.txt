Advocates Demand Justice For Sex Trafficked Teen Chrystul Kizer After Rittenhouse Verdict

Advocates say that sex-trafficked teen Chrystul Kizer, who is awaiting trial for the murder of a man she says she killed in self-defense when she was 16, should get the same treatment as the recently acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse.

Advocates are demanding justice for a Wisconsin woman who killed her sex trafficker and rapist following the recent acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse.

Rittenhouse, 18, was found not guilty on all charges earlier this month after his defense maintained that he had acted in self-defense when he killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, last year. Their deaths occurred after Rittenhouse attended a Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin following the 2020 police shooting of Black man Jacob Blake. He was armed with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle when he clashed with protesters.

During his trial, Rittenhouse testified that he "didn't do anything wrong" and that he "defended" himself. Meanwhile, the prosecution unsuccessfully argued that he was the aggressor.

Now, advocates for Chrystul Kizer, a Black sex trafficking victim, are demanding the same consideration for Kizer, who was 17-years-old when she killed Kenosha resident Randall Volar, 34. At the time of his death, Volar was awaiting trial for human trafficking. Kenosha law enforcement had seized photos and digital evidence that showed Volar sexually assaulting a series of young Black women and advertising them for sex. When Kizer was first arrested and charged with his murder, law enforcement initially withheld this evidence from her public defender.

Kizer claims that she shot Volar in self-defense before setting his home ablaze in 2018. She is still awaiting trial.
