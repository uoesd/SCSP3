Ohio Navy medic among those killed in Kabul airport attack

KABUL, Afghanistan (WTVG) - A Navy medic who graduated from Edison High School in Milan, Ohio in 2017 was among the dozen American service members killed in a deadly bombing at the Kabul airport earlier this week.

Max Soviak, of Berlin Heights, was identified in a letter from the Edison local school district. He died alongside 12 other members of the U.S. Armed Forces, along with more than 170 Afghans in the attack that has been claimed by ISIS-K, a terrorist organization in Afghanistan.

In the letter, Edison High School Superintendent Thomas C. Roth said, "Max was a good student who was active in sports and other activities throughout his school career. He was well respected and liked by everyone who knew him. Max was full of life in everything he did. Our schools and local community are mourning the loss of Max. He and his family are in all of our thoughts and prayers."

"It's not just a name. Everybody knows the young man and everything he has done and everything he has continued to do outside of high school.... Its like a member of the family has passed away", says Superintendent Roth.

Roth went on to say, "we're so proud of him, because he was there for others in their time of need, trying to help them. I think that just says a lot about Max."

The U.S. Navy also confirmed the death of one of their own in a statement Friday saying, "We mourn the loss of this Sailor and we offer our deepest condolences to the loved ones of our fallen shipmate." They did not identify Soviak.
