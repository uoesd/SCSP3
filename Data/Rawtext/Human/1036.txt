Texas cold snap expected to increase gas prices in Rockford and much of the country

ROCKFORD — A prolonged cold snap gripping much of the nation and hampering oil production in Texas is expected to trigger a 10-cent to 20-cent increase at gas pumps in Rockford and the rest of the country.

"Typically, something happening in Texas wouldn't necessarily effect us here in Illinois," said GasBuddy spokesman Patrick DeHaan, "but when it rises to the scale that 20% of the nation's oil refining capacity is down, we're talking about a significant portion of the nation's refining capacity being offline because of the extreme cold."

As recently as Sunday, all 254 counties in Texas were under a winter storm warming as arctic air brought freezing temperatures to the state and a low of minus 2 degrees on Tuesday in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, according to the National Weather Service.

DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said 11 refineries in Texas, the largest crude oil-producing state in the country, and one in Kansas have at least partially shut down due to the recent cold snap.

Thanks in large part to COVID-19 travel restrictions being lifted, demand has outpaced production causing gasoline prices to be on the rise even before the recent cold snap.

Thursday, the average price of gas in Illinois is $2.77 per gallon and $2.75 in Rockford compared to $2.48 at this time last year.

DeHaan said motorists can expect to see a 10-cent to 20-cent increase in gas per gallon over the next two weeks.

Couple that with the annual switch to the EPA-mandated production of summer-blend gasoline, a cleaner but more expensive blend of gas — the cost of which to make is passed on to the consumer — DeHaan said Rockfordians could be paying on average as much as $3 per gallon by Memorial Day weekend.
