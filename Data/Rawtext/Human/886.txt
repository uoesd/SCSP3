Ten-rific! Tom Brady will play his 10th Super Bowl. Here's a look back at his 9 previous appearances

Tom Brady is getting ready to play in his record 10th Super Bowl when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers face the Kansas City Chiefs on Feb. 7 in Super Bowl LV. It will be his first not as a member of the New England Patriots.

Brady has complied a 6-3 record in Super Bowls.

When it comes to Super Bowl appearances, it's not even close. After Brady's 10, two players are next-best with six: Brady's former New England teammate, kicker Stephen Gostkowski, and former Buffalo Bills and Denver Broncos nose tackle Mike Lodish.

Brady also has the most Super Bowl rings, with six. Behind Brady with five is Charles Haley.

Here is a look at the nine Super Bowls for which Brady has been a part, and the one about to take place:

Super Bowl XXXVI

When: Feb. 3, 2002

Final: New England Patriots 20, St. Louis Rams 17

Location: Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana

Crowd: 72,922

Brady's line: 16-for-27, 145 yards, 1 TD

Significance: Brady took over as the Patriots' starter when Drew Bledsoe suffered an injury during the second week of the season. After looking below average in his first two starts, Brady found his stride, leading the team, which started 0-2, to an 11-5 record. In the Super Bowl, the Rams scored to make it a 17-17 game with 1:30 remaining. Brady led a drive down the field with no timeouts, setting up a game-winning 48-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri as time expired. Despite lackluster numbers, the 24-year-old Brady was named the game's MVP.

Super Bowl XXXVIII

When: Feb. 1, 2004

Final: New England Patriots 32, Carolina Panthers 29

Location: Reliant Stadium, Houston, Texas

Crowd: 71,525

Brady's line: 32-for-48, 354 yards, 3 TDs, 1 INT

Significance: After missing the playoffs the prior year, Brady and the Patriots rolled to a 14-2 record. The Super Bowl was scoreless after one quarter, with Brady collecting just 43 yards passing. However, in the second quarter, Brady passed for 101 yards and a touchdown, including a 52-yarder to Deion Branch. In the fourth quarter, Brady connected with linebacker Mike Vrabel, who was in as an eligible receiver, on a 1-yard touchdown pass. For the second time, Brady was named the game's MVP.

Super Bowl XXXIX

When: Feb. 6, 2005

Final: New England Patriots 24, Philadelphia Eagles 21

Location: Alltel Stadium, Jacksonville, Florida

Crowd: 78,125

Brady's line: 23-for-33, 236 yards, 2 TDs

Significance: Brady connected with his favorite early-career target Deion Branch for a then Super Bowl-tying record 11 receptions for 133 yards. Branch would be named the game's MVP. Brady also would again connect with linebacker Mike Vrabel on a touchdown. And for the third time in four years, the Patriots won a Super Bowl by three points, each being won by the foot of Adam Vinatieri.

Super Bowl XLII

When: Feb. 3, 2008

Final: New York Giants 17, New England Patriots 14

Location: University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale, Arizona

Crowd: 71,101

Brady's line: 29-for-48, 266 yards, 1 TD

Significance: After a two-year Super Bowl absence, Brady and the Patriots returned to the game with perhaps their best team yet. They were 16-0 during the regular season and won two playoff games leading up to the Super Bowl. However, a stifling Giants defense and a just-good-enough Eli Manning shocked the Patriots, handing Tom Brady his first Super Bowl loss and allowing the 1972 Miami Dolphins to continue as the only undefeated team in league history.

Super Bowl XLVI

When: Feb. 5, 2012

Final: New York Giants 21, New England Patriots 17

Location: Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, Indiana

Crowd: 68,658
