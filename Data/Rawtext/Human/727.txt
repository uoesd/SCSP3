'I'll never forget:' Dad of 2-year-old killed in I-75 shooting wants son to be remembered

After much strategic planning, the best day of Brian Christian's life came Nov. 15, 2018 with the birth of his second son, Brison.

Brian and his wife, Tempestt, spent years planning for their second baby, making sure they did things right this time: They had married, bought a house in Dearborn and were working stable jobs.

But the Christian family's life upended Thursday night on their way home from basketball practice at around 9:45 p.m., when a car pulled up next to them on Interstate 75 and opened fire, striking 2-year-old Brison and 9-year-old Brian Jr. Brison was pronounced dead at the hospital.

"The way that car was shot, we were all supposed to die," Brian said. "I always say, if my kids die before me, take me with them."

Brison has been always been advanced, his father told the Free Press Monday. He began walking at 9 months and at 2 had already breezed through his Elmo and Sesame Street phases and had just started drinking out of "big boy" bottles.

"Love is an understatement, I can't even put it into words," Brian, 33, said, describing his bond with Brison.

"We took him everywhere, he was 2, but he's been everywhere," Brian said, adding that he and his wife have taken him to plays and on trips to different states, including visits to Kalahari and Disney World.

Brison had developed his own language of sorts — "You're welcome" was "Ooh nana," in his world — and was just beginning to piece together sentences.

"He had his own personality," Brian said. "It can never be replaced."

Brison's brother, 9-year-old "BJ," was grazed by a bullet and is home recovering.
