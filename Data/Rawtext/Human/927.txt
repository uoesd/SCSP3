In Their Own Words: The 43 Republicans' Explanations of Their Votes Not to Convict Trump in Impeachment Trial

On Saturday, the Senate voted 57-43 in the second impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. A deep look into the reasons each of the 43 Republican senators gave for their vote holds some lessons.

In this article, we provide the text for each of the 43 senators' statements (where available) and classify those statements according to whether the senator took a position on the merits of the case against Trump. Some senators clearly voted in support of Trump's defense against the allegations. Other senators, however, indicated that the House Managers proved their case but that the senator did not vote to convict on the theory that the Senate lacked jurisdiction to try a former president. Other senators gave no indication of their views on the merits, but also said the Senate lacked jurisdiction to decide. Indeed, one of the implications of this analysis is that, as a matter of law, it is technically inaccurate to call many of these 43 senators' decisions a vote to "acquit," at least not on the question of guilt or innocence. Indeed, over half of the 43 senators were either critical of Trump or expressed neither criticism nor support for him on the merits (e.g., Groups A, C & D below). Of the 100 senators who did reach the question of guilt or innocence, an enormous majority voted to convict.
