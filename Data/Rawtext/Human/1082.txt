'The Murder of Gabby Petito' documentary to air Friday on NBC's Peacock

A new documentary following the life, disappearance and death of 22-year old social media influencer Gabrielle "Gabby" Petito will be coming to NBC's Peacock streaming service Friday.

According to NBC, "The Murder of Gabby Petito: Truth, Lies and Social Media" documentary will feature Petito's parents and stepparents as they shed a new light on the tragic story with never-before-seen photos and stories of her life.

The documentary also features reporters who covered the shocking events that took place — including Herald-Tribune reporter Patricia McKnight.

"It was like every parents' nightmare," Petito's stepfather, Jim Schmidt, recalls in the trailer released this week. "Just like, in a flash of a second. She's gone, she's missing."

Petito's story drew worldwide attention after she went missing during a cross-country road trip with her fiancé Brian Laundrie, who returned home without her and refused to cooperate with law enforcement as they tried to piece together where she could have been.

Petito's body was found at Grand Teton National Park in mid-September. A Wyoming coroner ruled that she died of strangulation, adding that her body was "outside in the wilderness" three to four weeks before being found.

Laundrie was identified as the sole person of interest in Petito's disappearance, and then he disappeared as well, sparking a manhunt in the swampy woods of Sarasota County that dragged on for weeks.

Laundrie's remains were eventually found at a Florida nature preserve in late October, and the medical examiner ruled his death a suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

In addition to Petito's family firsthand accounts, the documentary also covers how social media investigators made a huge impact on the case.
