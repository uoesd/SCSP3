Huge Alligator Ate Louisiana Man After Hurricane Ida, Officials Confirm

A Louisiana coroner on Thursday confirmed human remains found inside a massive alligator were those of a New Orleans-area man who went missing after he was attacked following Hurricane Ida, in what appears to be the state's first fatal alligator attack in modern times.

Key Facts

St. Tammany Parish Coroner Dr. Charles Preston said remains found inside a 12-foot long, 504-pound alligator were those of 71-year-old Timothy Satterlee, who vanished on August 30 after an alligator attack. The man's wife said she heard a splash after he went outside his home one day after Hurricane Ida blew through the area and walked out to see him being attacked by the alligator, which had already ripped one of his arms off. The woman then took off in a boat to find an area with a cell signal to dial 911, but Satterlee had disappeared when she got back to the house—along with the alligator. Local sheriff's deputies found the enormous alligator near Satterlee's home two weeks after the attack, at which point they captured and killed it, finding human remains inside. Preston said he will likely rule the death was an accident.

Surprising Fact

There are more than 2 million alligators living in the wild in Louisiana, but the reptiles rarely attack humans. Fatal attacks are essentially unheard of, but at least one other death in the state's history is believed to be the result of an alligator attack. A French blacksmith named Jacques du Bois was found naked and dead on a river bank in 1774, with a coroner ruling he had been attacked by an alligator while bathing in the river, according to the St. Charles Herald Guide.

Big Number

1. That's how many people are killed annually by alligators in the U.S. on average, according to the University of Florida.
