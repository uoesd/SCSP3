Yes, a Black Kyle Rittenhouse Would Still Be Acquitted

A jury acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse last month on charges related to his Aug. 25, 2020, shooting of three white men during a chaotic, destructive night of civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin. This came as little surprise to anyone who watched the trial with an open mind.

Regardless of one's thoughts on the wisdom of a 17-year-old arming himself to defend the livelihoods of strangers, Rittenhouse had strong claims of lawful self-defense, and conviction seemed like an uphill battle for the state from the outset.

And yet, countless blue-check pundits on social media immediately lost their collective minds in a race-baiting game of "What if Rittenhouse was black?"

Their presumptive implication is that Rittenhouse's acquittal was based entirely on his race. Several highly followed commentators went so far as to explicitly assert that no person of color could ever intentionally shoot someone with a gun he or she carried in public and be acquitted on grounds of lawful self-defense.

The idea that self-defense is a legal justification largely for white Americans and that no jury would ever acquit defendants of color who claim they acted in self-defense is not just overly reductive, it's absurd.

It's also easily disprovable with a basic Google search.

Consider just some of the many non-white defendants who were acquitted of murder or attempted murder charges in recent years because juries determined they acted in lawful self-defense:

Tony Bristol —A jury acquitted Bristol on all charges related to a confrontation during which he fatally shot one man and wounded another. The prosecution argued that Bristol intentionally armed himself with a gun just before the confrontation and shot the two unarmed men—one in the back—over a longstanding interpersonal dispute. Bristol argued that he shot in self-defense after the men threatened him, and that he reasonably believed they were armed and posed an imminent danger.
