According to the California Franchise Tax Board, the total value of the payments is more than $857million.

To be eligible you must be a California resident and filed a 2020 state income tax return on or before October 15, 2021.

You also made $75,000 or less last year and have a Social Security or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.

Plus, you cannot be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer.

When will your stimulus check arrive?

The California Franchise Tax Board says it can take several days for a payment to be received by direct deposit.

For paper checks, payments will go out by the last three digits of the zip code on your 2020 tax return.

If your tax return is processed during or after the date of your scheduled zip code payment, allow up to 60 days after your return is processed.

The stimulus checks are being sent on a rolling basis through the beginning of next year.

An estimated nine million Californians are expected to receive one.

Know your zip code

Based on the scheduled release by the tax board, the state has either sent or is in the process of mailing checks with the last three digits of 000 to 375.

Zip codes ending in 376 to 927 will be going out between November 15 to December 31.
