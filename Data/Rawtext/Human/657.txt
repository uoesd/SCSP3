Man seen with Kyle Rittenhouse victim charged with arson in Kenosha

Kenosha prosecutors have filed arson charges against a man involved in key confrontations during protests in August that included the fatal shooting of two people.

Joshua Ziminski now faces a felony count of arson, along with misdemeanors of disorderly conduct with a dangerous weapon and obstructing an officer. At a hearing Tuesday, prosecutors dismissed an earlier case involving the disorderly conduct with a weapon, which stemmed from Ziminski firing a shot in the air right before Kyle Rittenhouse shot Joseph Rosenbaum between some cars at a gas station.

Rittenhouse supporters had referred the weapon charge as "the first shot," and suggested it was close enough in location to make Rittenhouse think he was being fired upon.

Ziminski, 35, and his wife, Kelly, were also seen on various videos of the evening's events hanging out with Rosenbaum, including right before Rosenbaum began chasing Rittenhouse.

According to the new complaint:

On the night of Aug. 25, the Ziminskis were involved in trying to block police as they tried to disperse crowds of protesters south of the government center along Sheridan Road.

Around 11:15 p.m., Kelly Ziminski recorded her husband starting a large rolling trash bin fire at a gas station near 56th St., calling for other protesters to pour more flammable liquids into the container, then pushing it out into the southbound lanes of Sheridan Road, into the path of police.

Another video shows Ziminski near an overturned trailer that was on fire, and "manipulating the fire with his right foot." The trailer, which belonged to Azerian Wrecking, was also blocking police, according to the complaint.

Kelly Ziminski, 30, was charged in December with disorderly conduct, resisting an officer and curfew violation. She is scheduled for a pretrial conference in that case Friday.
