James Schmidt spoke to DailyMail.com in Wyoming, where he had traveled from his Long Island home to assist in the search for Petito.

Petito's family last heard from her when she and Laundrie, her boyfriend, were traveling through Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park.

On September 11 — 10 days after Laundrie returned to his Florida home — Petito was reported missing.

Laundrie has since spoken only through a lawyer and is not offering information to the police, drawing condemnation from Petito's family. On Wednesday, they released a statement calling the silence "reprehensible."

"It's unacceptable," Schmidt told DailyMail.com. "It's unacceptable to us. We deserve more, Gabby deserves more information. She deserves to be found and brought home safe."

Addressing the Laundrie family directly, he said: "We need you to step up and do the right thing." He said he understood that Laundrie's parents may want to protect their child, but that they should still speak out.

"Whatever may have transpired or didn't transpire, they need to come forward," he said.

"The longer they don't, the longer it's going to take to bring her home. And we need her home now. So they have to."

"Please, stop staying in the background, and come out, and help find Gabby," he added, an apparent reference to Laundrie's statement that said he would "remain in the background" for the search.
