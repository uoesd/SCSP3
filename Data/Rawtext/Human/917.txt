Tom Brady is launching a clothing brand with one of the brains behind Kim Kardashian's Skims

Tom Brady is launching his own fashion label called, simply, "Brady."

The brand will debut in December and includes activewear and training clothes.

Brady created the label with Jens Grede, the cofounder of Kim Kardashian's Skims.

Tom Brady is embarking on the next phase of his career, but it's not in football — it's in fashion.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback and seven-time Super Bowl winner announced Tuesday the launch of a forthcoming fashion line, called, simply, "Brady." The label, which will debut in December, consists of activewear and training clothes, according to The Wall Street Journal's Jason Gay.

Brady won't be building the collection on his own — he partnered with Jens Grede, who will serve as the brand's cofounder and CEO, and designer Dao-Yi Chow, who cofounded the streetwear label Public School New York, according to WWD.

Grede told the Journal they plan to build "Brady" into the biggest namesake sportswear brands, akin to NBA legend Michael Jordan's Jordan Brand.

"We're just focused on creating the finest sports brand in the world," Grede said. "That really is the ambition."

Grede has a successful track record of building direct-to-consumer fashion brands, WWD points out. Grede helped build Kim Kardashian's popular Skims line, which includes underwear, shapewear, and loungewear, as well as Good American, a denim line co-created by Khloé Kardashian and Grede's wife, Emma Grede. He also cofounded Frame, which offers men's and women's denim and contemporary clothing.

Grede told WWD in June that revenue from the three brands combined is predicted to hit $500 million in 2021.

Brady will be based in Los Angeles and has been in development for three years, WWD reports.
