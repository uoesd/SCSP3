A list of some of the deadliest days for the US Army after explosions at Kabul airport kill at least 13 American soldiers.

At least 13 United States soldiers are among the 85 people killed in the explosions at Kabul airport, claimed by ISIL (ISIS) affiliate, the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP or ISIS-K).
