Stimulus update: $2,000 monthly checks? Petition now has 2.8 million signatures

More than 2.8 million people have signed a Change.org petition calling for the federal government to provide $2,000 in monthly stimulus payments.

One petition is named "$2000/month to every American #moneyforthepeople #covid19" and is directed at Congress. If the petition gets 3 million signatures, its target goal, it would be "become one of the top signed on Change.org," according to the website.

"We need immediate checks and recurring payments so that we can keep our heads above water," Stephanie Bonin, one of the larger petitions' creators, told Newsweek.

Five smaller Change.org petitions for monthly checks also have begun to gain traction on the internet recently, according to Newsweek.

However, despite the petition's increased growth, it is unlikely that the White House or Congress will issue a fourth stimulus check at this point and time due to the economy's consistent improvement.

The Biden administration has not passed any direct legislation regarding a fourth stimulus check, and the majority of Congress has seemed to steer clear of a fourth stimulus package as well for now, preferring to focus on more targeted efforts as the economy improves.

A fourth stimulus check has been at the top of many Americans' minds this year. Most recently, rumors were flying on the internet about a fourth stimulus check being disbursed by the federal government this week of up to $7,000. Those rumors, however, are not true.

The federal government has distributed three rounds of stimulus payments. The first payment was distributed in March 2020, in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, where eligible individuals received up to $1,200.
