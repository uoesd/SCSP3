Mary Trump says her uncle Donald would 'never' sacrifice himself for his kids if prosecutors went after them

Mary Trump was asked if her uncle Donald would "take one for his kids" if prosecutors came for them.

She said he wouldn't, and that "he would fully expect them to take a hit for him, to benefit him."

"He would never do anything to protect them if it were at his expense," she said.

Mary Trump said her uncle, former President Donald Trump, would never sacrifice himself for his children if they were in legal trouble.

CNN's Chris Cuomo asked her on Monday what Donald Trump would do if prosecutors zeroed in on his children: "What would it mean to Donald Trump if they came after his kids? Would that change his disposition, do you think? Would he take one for his kids?"

She responded: "No, he wouldn't."

"I think if that were to happen, if prosecutors were to go after his children, he would fully expect them to take a hit for him, to benefit him," she said.

"What he probably doesn't understand is that's not really how it works. You know, they always try to get people to flip so they can go after the bigger target. But Donald would never imagine in a million years that his children would do that, although I'm fairly sure they would."

"So if that indeed happens, it's going to be fascinating, because he would never do anything to protect them if it were at his expense," she said.

Donald Trump's company, the Trump Organization — which his sons Eric and Donald Jr. work for — is currently under criminal investigation in New York. Prosecutors in Georgia and Washington, DC, are also scrutinizing Trump's own actions.
