Who is better: Peyton Manning or Tom Brady?

We'll get this out of the way first: If all you care about are the rings then you have your answer.

The greatest quarterback of all-time is, of course, Otto Graham.

I'm kidding. (Sort of, Graham played 10 seasons, won seven titles so you do kind of have to tell me why, if rings are all that matter, Graham's not the best quarterback of all time.)

Tom Brady won his seventh title Sunday. If that's all that matters to you — and that's a pretty good argument — then he's the greatest quarterback of all-time.

Peyton Manning will almost certainly be announced as a hall of famer on Saturday night. The argument of who is better is closer than you think.

Brady vs. Manning by the numbers

An average season for Manning was an 11-5 record, completing 65.3% of his passes for 4,231 yards, 32 touchdowns and 15 interceptions with a 96.5 passer rating. Brady is at 12-4, completing 64.0% of his passes for 4,210 yards, 31 touchdowns and 10 interceptions with a 97.3 passer rating.

Manning set the single-season touchdown passes record with 49 in 2004, Brady threw 50 in 2007 then Manning had 55 in 2013. Manning owns the passing yards record with 5,477 in 2013 and his passer rating of 121.1 in 2004 is No. 3 all-time. Brady has the third-most passing yards in a season (5,235 in 2011) and his 117.2 passer rating in 2007 is sixth all-time.

Brady is No. 1 in passing touchdowns (581), No. 2 in passing yards (79,204) and seventh in passer rating (97.3). Manning is No. 3 in passing yards (71,940), No. 3 in TDs (539) and 11th in passer rating (96.5). Manning's passer rating is 17% better than the league average during his career, Brady's 15%. (Sid Luckman was 58% better than the average quarterback during his career, by the way.)

Manning's biggest edge on Brady is his seven first-team All-Pro seasons, Johnny Unitas is next at five among quarterbacks. Brady had three. Manning also won a record five MVP awards, Brady three. For the people following the sports the closest during their careers, Manning was better than Brady during the regular season.

Edge: Manning. Brady's rate statistics will continue to drop if he plays until he's 45 but he's continued to be a high-quality quarterback. Manning's peak was better so he gets the nod.

Manning vs. Brady head-to-head

Manning was just 6-11 versus Brady with an 87.7 passer rating but New England was the best team in the NFL during that stretch. Brady was, of course, 11-6 against Manning, with a 92.8 passer rating. Manning lost his first six games to Brady and the Patriots, which means he won 6 of the last 11, including two playoff victories.

Edge: Brady. This is probably closer than most fans realize, but the advantage is clear.

Manning vs. Brady in the postseason

It's easy to point to Manning's playoff record -- 14-13 -- versus Brady's -- 34-11 -- but we need to go a little deeper than that. Manning has the edge in completion percentage (.632 vs. .627) but Brady is ahead on touchdowns (83 vs. 40, with an edge per game) and they each average slightly less than one interception per game. Brady has the edge in passer rating -- 90.4 vs. 87.4.

The top 50 quarterbacks in passing yards see their passer rating drop by 9% on average.
