Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity Has The Week's Most-Watched Show As CNN's Cuomo Loses Viewers

Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity had the most-watched show in cable news last week, with Hannity delivering a total audience of 3.7 million viewers, just ahead of Tucker Carlson Tonight, which has consistently been the highest-rated hour on any of the cable news networks for most of 2021.

Hannity also finished first among viewers 25-54, the key demographic group most valued by advertisers, with a total audience of 669,000 viewers. Tucker Carlson Tonight was a close second with 654,000 viewers.

For the week (August 16 through 22), Fox News Channel led all cable news networks with an average total audience of 2.980 million viewers, according to ratings data compiled by Nielsen. That put FNC far ahead not just of CNN and MSNBC, but Fox also beat the broadcast networks in prime time, with NBC delivering 2.684 million viewers, CBS delivering 2.491 million viewers and ABC delivering 2.372 million viewers. Last week marked the 27th consecutive week that Fox News Channel beat CNN and MSNBC in both total day and prime time ratings.

Rounding out the top five most-watched shows of the week were FNC's The Five (3.5 million total viewers and 552,000 viewers in the key demo—a record high for the show this year), The Ingraham Angle (2.8 million total viewers and 532,000 viewers 25-54) and Special Report with Bret Baier (2.6 million total viewers and 441,000 viewers in the key demo).

The week also marked the return of Chris Cuomo to CNN's Cuomo Prime Time, with the hour delivering a total audience of 1.076 million viewers (down 28%) and 267,000 viewers in the key demo (down more than 30%). Driving the losses for CNN's top-rated hour was significant drop-off of women viewers, down 30% for the week.
