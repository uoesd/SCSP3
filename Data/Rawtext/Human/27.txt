Teen who bonded with Biden over stutter delivers powerful rendition of JFK speech in inauguration special

The New Hampshire teenager who bonded with President Joe Biden over their shared experience with stuttering gave a powerful rendition of John F. Kennedy's inaugural address Wednesday at an inaugural celebration.

Brayden Harrington, 13, was featured alongside performances, poetry and former presidents during "Celebrating America," the 90-minute program hosted by Tom Hanks for the inauguration of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

He recited part of Kennedy's speech that includes the famous passage, "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."

Harrington told CNN that Biden's inauguration shows kids, particularly those who stutter, "that they matter." He told the network he was honored to be part of the inaugural festivities for Biden.

"He's come a long way and I'm pretty happy for him," Brayden said. "He basically has the whole country in his hands, and I know he'll be good at that."

Brayden first met Biden in February during a campaign stop in Concord. Biden asked for his contact information and offered to share the strategies he used to overcome his stutter.

"Don't let it define you," Biden told Brayden. "You are smart as hell."

Biden has spoken publicly of being teased throughout his childhood about his stutter. He was called Joe Impedimenta, Dash and Stutterhead by classmates, he said.

Brayden spoke at the Democratic National Convention last August. He praised Biden for giving him confidence and helping him prepare for that speech that has been viewed millions of times.

"I'm just a regular kid," he said. "And in a short amount of time, Joe Biden made me more confident about something that's bothered me my whole life."
