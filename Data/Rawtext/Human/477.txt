Can the monarchy survive Harry and Meghan? Here's how the queen's royal crisis could end

For a thousand years, give or take, crowned heads have presided over the nations that make up the United Kingdom – but will it always be so? Once again, anti-monarchists are suggesting it might not after Queen Elizabeth II shuffles off this mortal coil.

For years, the republicans, as anti-royalists are known in the U.K., have understood that the queen, 94, after nearly seven decades on the throne, is overwhelmingly popular, despite rare missteps over the years. As long as she heads "The Firm," a hereditary monarchy will stand.

But her 72-year-old son and heir, Prince Charles, is not as popular, and he took hits in a recent YouGov poll: About 42% said they have a negative view of him, up from 36%. His favorability numbers have decreased from 57% to 49%. King Charles III has long seemed an iffy enough proposition for republicans to harbor hope of voting out the monarchy eventually.

Now, they've been further emboldened by the shattering of the shiny royal façade by the queen's grandson and Charles' younger son, Prince Harry, and his biracial American wife, Duchess Meghan of Sussex.
