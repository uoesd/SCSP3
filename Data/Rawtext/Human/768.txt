LA Times: Arizona gun expert was second armorer for 'Rust' ahead of fatal shooting

While 24-year-old Hannah Gutierrez Reed has drawn international criticism about her role as a gun expert for the movie "Rust" at the time Alec Baldwin fatally shot a cinematographer on set, the Los Angeles Times revealed Monday that a second gun expert from Arizona had also been working on the movie.

Seth Kenney, who owns a weapon and prop rental company in Lake Havasu City, was an "armorer mentor" for Gutierrez Reed and had suggested her for the job, and he supplied the guns used on set, according to the LA Times.

Kenney established PDQ Media Arm & Prop, LLC and Havatool Co., LLC in Lake Havasu City in 2017, according to Arizona Corporations Commission online documents.

The Los Angeles Times investigation relies on numerous unnamed sources, two of whom allege "Kenney provided the Colt .45 that Baldwin fired that day," but it is "unclear what, if any, ammunition Kenney may have provided." It also is unclear if or when he was on set.

Investigators believe Baldwin discharged a prop gun and it fired a single live round that killed Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza on Oct. 21. Baldwin was told the gun was "cold," indicating that it didn't contain ammunition, but a live bullet was later discovered.

Last month, lawyers for Gutierrez Reed suggested someone may have intended to "sabotage" the set with the live bullet, and said Gutierrez Reed was "incredibly safety conscious" on set.

Gutierrez Reed lives in Bullhead City, about 65 miles north of Kenney in Lake Havasu City, according to the LA Times. She experienced her first job as a head armorer on the set of the upcoming Nicolas Cage movie "The Old Way."
