Bristol High School Closed Due To Shooting Threat, Student Arrest

A Bristol Borough High School student who is accused of making a shooting threat was taken into custody early Monday morning.

The threat led to Bristol Borough School District officials closing the school on Monday. The facility that educates the town's middle and high school students will reopen Tuesday with additional police presence.

The school district said in a statement the threat was received around 10 p.m. on Sunday through the Safe2Say tip system. The tip stated there was a student with a "plan to shoot up the high school."

Sgt. Joe Moors, who is leading the borough police department while the agency seeks a new chief, said the department began investigating once school administration notified them of the threat.

"Shortly after 1 a.m., with assistance from the Bucks County District Attorney's Office and the Bucks County Juvenile Probation Department, Bristol Borough police arrested the student and transported him to the juvenile detention center," he said.

The teenage boy was charged through the juvenile court system with terroristic threats and disorderly conduct.

Moors said no weapons were found with the student, but he is alleged to have mention a "specific plan and specific threat."

The threat follows last week's Oxford, Michigan high school shooting that killed four students and wounded seven others. The 15-year-old shooter and his parents were charged in connection with the attack.
