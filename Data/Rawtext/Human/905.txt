Ranking Tom Brady's best and worst Super Bowl performances

Ten isn't always perfect.

Tom Brady is about to make his record 10th Super Bowl appearance, but the six-time champion hasn't always been at his best in the big game. In fact, he's been more late-game clutch than overall dominant, even in winning four Super Bowl MVPs.

Here is our ranking of his first nine Super Bowl performances:

1. Super Bowl LI: Patriots 34, Falcons 28 (2016)

It was on pace to be Brady's worst Super Bowl in the third quarter, when the Patriots trailed 28-3 and the quarterback's most noteworthy play was throwing a pick-six. But he orchestrated the biggest Super Bowl comeback in the first one ever to go to overtime by completing 43-of-62 passes for 466 yards and two touchdowns.

Brady completed third-down passes to three different receivers on the game-tying 91-yard touchdown drive — then capped it with a must-have 2-point conversion pass. The halftime adjustment to target 1-on-1 coverage outside the numbers was brilliant.

2. Super Bowl XLIX: Patriots 28, Seahawks 24 (2014)

You remember Malcolm Butler's goal-line interception, but did you forget the Patriots' 10-point fourth-quarter comeback?

Undeterred by the dark cloud of Deflategate and an unthinkable decade-long championship drought, Brady was 37-of-50 for 328 yards and four touchdowns with two interceptions. But he was 13-of-15 for 124 yards with two touchdowns in the fourth quarter against the NFL's top-ranked defense, anchored by its secondary.

3. Super Bowl LII: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 (2017)

Like the only other quarterback ever to throw for 500 yards in the playoffs — Ben Roethlisberger, three weeks ago — Brady lost. Unlike Roethlisberger, Brady wasn't piling up meaningless stats.

Brady took shots down the field in completing 28-of-48 passes for 505 yards — including 237 yards while throwing under pressure — and three touchdowns with no interceptions. But he was strip-sacked by Brandon Graham in the closing minutes of a shootout.

4. Super Bowl XXXVIII: Patriots 32, Panthers 29 (2003)

Graduation day! The end of knocking Brady as a game-manager came when he led two scoring drives in the final four minutes of the first half and two more in the final three minutes of the second half. He threw for 354 yard and three touchdowns — one of which claimed the lead with three minutes to go — on a then-record 32 completions.

After the Panthers tied the score with 68 seconds left, Brady set up Adam Vinatieri in range for the winning field goal.

5. Super Bowl XXXVI: Patriots 20, Rams 17 (2001)

Who is this guy? He was the backup who replaced Drew Bledsoe early that season.

Brady's final numbers were those of a caretaker: 16-of-27 for 145 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. But his legend was born in the final 90 seconds, when the great broadcaster John Madden suggested the Patriots should play for overtime. Brady completed five passes — including a 23-yarder to Troy Brown — to set up the last-second field goal.

6. Super Bowl XXXIX: Patriots 24, Eagles 21 (2004)

The win that cemented the dynasty.

Donovan McNabb had the gaudy stats (357 yards, three touchdowns) but made the mistakes (three interceptions) his counterpart did not. Linebacker Mike Vrabel caught one of Brady's two touchdown passes, and favorite target Deion Branch exploded for 11 catches, 133 yards and MVP honors.

7. Super Bowl XLVI: Giants 21, Patriots 17 (2011)
