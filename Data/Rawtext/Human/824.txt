Fourth stimulus checks, recurring payments? The push continues, but here are the many ways you may get direct relief now

The fourth round of stimulus checks has been a hot-button topic all summer (and maybe even late spring) — just months after the third-round of stimulus checks started to be deposited into the bank accounts of millions of Americans in March 2021.

While President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into action on Thursday, March 11, it has taken months for millions of Americans to receive their the third round of stimulus checks. All the while, the movement for more direct relief in the form of fourth and/or fifth-round stimulus checks, or recurring payments has only grown.

A restaurant owner named Stephanie Bonin started a petition early in the pandemic, campaigning for $2,000 monthly recurring payments. Since then, the Change.org petition has gained momentum, nearly reaching its 3 million signature goal to become a top petition on the platform. At the time of publication of this article, the petition has reached over 2.8 million signatures.

Bonin even updated the petition amid the pandemic, citing millions of Americans still need recurring financial help. Progressive lawmakers have also written petitions to the White House for recurring payments and/or more in stimulus money, citing Americans need direct relief until the pandemic ended.

While the fight for more rounds or recurring stimulus checks continues, currently here are the many ways Americans may still receive direct financial relief from the government.
