Did You Get A $2,000 Stimulus Check?

The question seems obvious enough: Did you get a $2,000 stimulus check? Surely, you could check your bank account for direct deposit, find a deposit slip for a paper stimulus check, or even locate your pre-paid debit card. However, you won't find a $2,000 stimulus check in any of these forms because Congress didn't approve a $2,000 stimulus check. Or did they?

Both before and after the U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia in January, Democrats touted $2,000 stimulus checks. For example:

President Joe Biden: Then President-elect Joe Biden said that Georgia voters would get $2,000 stimulus payments if Democrats won the Senate runoff elections.

Then President-elect Joe Biden said that Georgia voters would get $2,000 stimulus payments if Democrats won the Senate runoff elections. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY): Schumer said the $2,000 stimulus checks would be a top priority for the new stimulus package to help stimulate the economy and help Americans in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Schumer said the $2,000 stimulus checks would be a top priority for the new stimulus package to help stimulate the economy and help Americans in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT): Sanders said, "the working class of this country was promised that they would receive a $2,000 direct payment. ...We must keep that promise."

While Democrats won both runoff elections in Georgia, the 50-50 split in the U.S. Senate meant progressives would have to appease moderate Democrats such as Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV). "I don't know where in the hell $2,000 came from," Manchin (D-WV) told the Washington Post in January, referring to $2,000 stimulus checks. "I swear to God I don't. That's another $400 billion dollars."

Congress passed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which Biden signed into law Thursday. However, the new stimulus package didn't include $2,000 stimulus checks either. Instead, the new stimulus package included $1,400 stimulus checks for individuals and $2,800 for married and joint filers. Several Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives highlighted the discrepancy between what was apparently "promised" ($2,000 stimulus checks) and what was "delivered" ($1,400 stimulus checks). They argue that additional $2,000 stimulus checks are essential for Americans who are struggling financially as as result of the Covid-19 pandemic. For example:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY): Ocasio-Cortez said in January that "$2,000 means $2,000. $2,000 does not mean $1,400," referring to Biden's "promise" to deliver $2,000 stimulus checks.
