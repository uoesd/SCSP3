Colin Powell, trailblazing soldier and statesman who made case for Iraq invasion, dies of Covid at 84

WASHINGTON – Colin Powell, the trailblazing soldier and statesman, has died from Covid complications at the age of 84. Powell, who was fully vaccinated against Covid, had several underlying conditions. He had been suffering from Parkinson's disease and had been treated recently for multiple myeloma, according to a Powell family spokesperson. Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer that hurts the body's ability to fight infections. Fully vaccinated people with weakened immune systems make up a large proportion of hospitalized breakthrough cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Powell had also undergone surgery for prostate cancer when he was secretary of State nearly two decades ago. Powell and his wife, Alma Powell, tested positive for Covid a week ago. Alma Powell, who will soon turn 84 herself, has been suffering Covid symptoms and was recovering at home, the spokesperson said. Colin Powell had planned to get a booster shot last week, but he wasn't feeling well enough to get it, the spokesperson added.

Tributes pour in

Powell, who served in the military from the early days of the Vietnam era through America's first war with Iraq, was the nation's first Black national security advisor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretary of State. Leaders and former colleagues hailed him as a leader and a hero. Former President George W. Bush, whom Powell served as secretary of State, praised him as a "great public servant." His successor at the State Department, Condoleezza Rice, called Powell "a truly great man." President Joe Biden called Powell his friend and fondly remembered that the late statesman and general "could drive his Corvette Stingray like nobody's business."
