Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces Bill To Grant Kyle Rittenhouse Congressional Gold Medal

Key Facts

The bill states Rittenhouse should be awarded the honor because he "protected the community of Kenosha" during the "Black Lives Matter riot" last year. The bill has no chance of getting passed given it would need to be co-sponsored by at least two-thirds of the House, which is currently controlled by Democrats, some of whom have been loudly critical of Rittenhouse. Greene defended Rittenhouse during his trial, tweeting that he was "more of a man" than those attacking him on social media following his emotional testimony last week, and cheered his acquittal on Twitter, saying he was "one of the good ones."

Tangent

A spokesperson for Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who has said he would hire Rittenhouse as an intern following his acquittal, told the Washington Post that awarding Rittenhouse the Congressional Gold Medal would "give him a big head during the internship with our office."
