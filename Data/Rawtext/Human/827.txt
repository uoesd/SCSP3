Here's when the next batch of California stimulus checks will be released

The third batch of California stimulus checks, also known as the Golden State Stimulus, will be sent out at the start of October, the California Franchise Tax Board said.

The payments will be sent out on Oct. 5, according to the Franchise Tax Board, which could not immediately provide an estimate for the size of the batch. For reference, the last batch went out to 2 million Californians, and the one before that went out to 600,000. It's estimated that about 9 million Californians are eligible for the payments.

This round of payments will also include mailed paper checks, rather than just direct deposits.

The Franchise Tax Board previously said that payments would be sent in two-week intervals. The previous payments were sent on Aug. 27 and Sept. 17. In other words, it may take some time for your check to reach your mailbox.

Wondering how much you'll receive? The Tax Board has a handy tool on its website that helps you determine the amount.

Generally, if you qualified for the first Golden State Stimulus payment and claimed a credit of one or more dependents, you'll receive $500. If you did not qualify for that stimulus payment and did not claim a credit of one or more dependents, you'll receive $600. If you did not qualify for that stimulus and claimed one or more dependents, you could receive $1,100. Lastly, if you qualified for the stimulus and did not claim a credit for one or more dependents, you do not qualify for the second stimulus payment.

Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill July 12 that includes $12 billion in relief for families "hit hardest by the pandemic."

"The state is taking on the inequities laid bare by the pandemic, expanding our support for Californians facing the greatest hardship," Newsom said at the time.
