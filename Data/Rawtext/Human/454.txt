Prince Harry, Meghan Markle have a four-book deal with Penguin Random House

Prince Harry's book deal is reportedly a lot heftier than initially thought.

The Daily Mail is reporting that, far from the original single-memoir deal Harry was said to have inked, he and wife Meghan Markle actually got four books as part of their deal with Penguin Random House.

"The final contract was actually for a four-book deal, with Harry writing another 'when his granny dies,'" the Mail quotes "an impeccably-placed source in the publishing industry" as saying.

But a spokesperson for the couple tells Page Six that contrary to those reports, there is only one memoir planned by Harry and it's scheduled to be released in late 2022 as originally announced.

Sources add it's "appalling" to tie anything to the Queen's death, as the Mail reported one of Harry's books would be.

A "wellness-type" book written by Markle will be another of the lot, while the subject matter of the other two books is unknown.

"Meghan will write a wellness-type book and people are unsure what the fourth will be."

Harry, 36, is said to have "led" negotiations from his Montecito, Calif., home.

"He had a very 'take it or leave it' attitude," the Mail's publishing source relayed. "Those involved were actually very shocked by his approach, which was to look at them coldly and state his demands: $25 million."

Page Six reported that Harry's $20 million memoir is not meant as a "f–k you" to the royal family. The deal left Buckingham Palace in an uproar when it was announced, though the Duke of Sussex feels that he is merely telling his "truth" with the book, slated for a late 2022 release.

One insider begged to differ, telling us, "On what planet does Harry think that this is not a 'f–k you' to the family?"

Markle's children's book, "The Bench" made it onto the New York Times Bestseller list this summer, just in time for Harry's third Father's Day — and the birth of his and Markle's second child, Lilibet Diana.
