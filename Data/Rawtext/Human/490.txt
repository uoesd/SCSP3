Map: Where Ida Has Left Louisiana and Mississippi Without Power

More than 850,000 homes and businesses in Louisiana and Mississippi were still without power on Friday morning, according to data from PowerOutage.us, after Hurricane Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, La., on Sunday as a Category 4 storm.

The hurricane brought with it 150 m.p.h. winds, according to the National Hurricane Center. By Monday morning it had weakened into a tropical storm as it moved inland.

The hurricane strengthened rapidly as it passed through the Gulf of Mexico, fed by its warm water. This satellite imagery from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows water vapor in the atmosphere as the storm made landfall.

More than 16 inches of rain fell in some parts of Louisiana as the storm moved through the region. The flood-protection system built around New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina appears to have succeeded at preventing catastrophic flooding in the city.

Satellite images taken in the hours before the storm made landfall showed how much of Grand Isle, La., became submerged as heavy rains caused flooding in low-lying regions along the Louisiana coast.

Ida, the ninth named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, formed on Thursday in the Caribbean Sea. In preparation for the storm, officials ordered evacuations in many areas along the coast. "Some areas may be uninhabitable for weeks," the National Weather Service in New Orleans said on Twitter.
