Biden's inauguration will not be the 'largest ever' – by design

US President-elect Joe Biden says goal is 'to keep America safe' amid COVID-19, 'but still allow people to celebrate'.

Among United States President Donald Trump's many controversies in his first few days in office four years ago was a self-inflicted one about how many people attended his inauguration on January 20, 2017.

"[W]e had a massive field of people. You saw them. Packed," Trump said the day after he was sworn in. "I looked out, the field was – it looked like a million, million and a half people."

Then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer went even further, telling reporters the crowd in Washington, DC, that day "was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration – period – both in person and around the globe".

Neither was telling the truth.

If President-elect Joe Biden has anything to say about the crowd sizes at his inauguration on January 20, it will be to make sure as few people show up as possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"I think you're going to see something that's closer to what the convention was like than a typical inauguration," Biden said earlier this month, suggesting the festivities will be mostly virtual, as was the case for the Democratic National Convention in August.

"First and foremost, in my objective, is to keep America safe but still allow people to celebrate – to celebrate and see one another celebrate," Biden added.

This week, workers dismantled the reviewing stand – the location in front of the White House where the newly sworn-in US president and vice president and their families take in the inauguration parade.

Biden had already hinted that a "gigantic inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue" would not be in the cards and the US president-elect's inaugural committee said the parade will "be reimagined".
