Analysis: How Much Will the $1,400 Stimulus Check Help Financially Vulnerable Americans?

The lack of data-driven debate regarding the third stimulus package reflects the scarcity of data on households' finances. To date, the focus has been on how a stimulus package will impact consumer spending, but it is not clear how President Joe Biden's proposed $1,400 stimulus check for eligible households will affect Americans' ability to pay their bills.

Conventional economic data such as gross domestic product and high-frequency consumer spending data both measure economic output. Similarly, aggregate personal saving data offers no insight into the distribution of savings across the population. While these data sources offer important insight into the likely impact of fiscal spending on the economy, they only tell part of the story.

To assess the impact, amount and eligibility of a third stimulus package, Morning Consult analyzed its proprietary tracking data on household finances, which offers insight into the current condition of households' balance sheets.

Using this data, this analysis argues that a third round of $1,400 stimulus checks more narrowly targeted to low-income adults and parents combined with enhancements to the country's unemployment benefit system would prevent unnecessary financial hardship and mitigate future economic risks.

The purpose of fiscal spending during a recession is not only to boost short-term economic activity; it's also to provide financially vulnerable households with enough money to avoid unnecessary financial harm. As a society, delinquencies and defaults are inefficient and costly uses of resources, and financial uncertainty prevents families from investing in their futures. During recessions, it's cheaper for the country as a whole to keep people out of financial trouble than it is helping them fight their way back.
