Vice President Kamala Harris speaks exclusively with WSAZ about challenges facing our region

HUNTINGTON/CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) - As we navigate month 10 of the COVID-19 pandemic, the weight on the shoulders of American families is insurmountable.

On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke exclusively with WSAZ's Amanda Barren. We had the opportunity to ask her if help is coming -- and when.

"To your point in West Virginia, one in seven families is describing their household as being hungry, one in six can't pay their rent, and one in four small businesses are closing permanently or have already closed, so it's a big issue in West Virginia and across the country," Harris said. "And that's why the president and I are offering the American Rescue Plan."

The American Rescue Plan (ARP) would put cash into American's bank accounts. It has the framework for small business help, money for the return to education and extending the eviction and foreclosure moratorium.

It also has provisions for extended unemployment.

As the vice president advocates for the ARP, many people across our region feel like they are advocating for their jobs in the coal, oil and gas industries. This is on the heels of executive orders signed by President Biden connected to the energy industry that jeopardize traditional energy jobs.

We asked Harris about plans for retraining of those workers, something people have heard before with little follow through.

"All of those skilled workers who are in the coal industry and transferring those skills to what we need to do in terms of dealing with reclaiming abandoned land mines; what we need to do around plugging leaks from oil and gas wells; and, transferring those important skills to the work that has yet to be done that needs to get done," the vice president said.
