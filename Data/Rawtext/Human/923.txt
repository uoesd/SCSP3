Tampa Bay Buccaneers happy to have Tom Brady back after knee surgery

Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians delivered a concise summation when asked what impressed him most about quarterback Tom Brady's activity on Tuesday.

"Went full speed," Arians said after the team's first minicamp practice, adding that Brady was typically eager for more work. "He looked fine. I had to pull him out a couple (of times). The first period I said, 'OK, you can have four,' and he kept begging to go back in."

A seven-time Super Bowl champion, Tom Brady had minor surgery on his left knee after leading the Buccaneers to the title in February over the Kansas City Chiefs, but he seemingly believes he's close to 100 percent.

Brady, who will turn 44 in August, posted a video of himself working out and had organized a workout with teammates last Friday.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Tom Brady cleared after knee surgery

Still, it was somewhat surprising that he was cleared fully.

"Yeah, the doctors and him – they both said he was good to go," Arians said. "We'll still be careful with what we're doing with him, but trying to stop him from playing is pretty tough."

Whether Brady can duplicate his 2020 regular season — 4,633 passing yards, 40 touchdowns, 65.7 completion percentage — is up for debate, but what's one more year when he did what he did at age 43.

He'll have an even better grasp of Tampa's offense.

"It's that second, third, fourth read, where the guys are going to be, knowing (where to throw). ... "All that verbiage isn't new now, so he can spit it out, he knows what it means, he knows where they're going to be," Arians said.

With an increased level of comfort in Year 2 with the Bucs, Tom Brady and his receivers could be more dangerous.
