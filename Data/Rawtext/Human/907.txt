If Bucs win another Super Bowl, Tom Brady resolves to toss Lombardi Trophy again

Five days before the dawn of 2022, Tom Brady has cited a New Year's resolution that might best be described as deja viral.

He wants another crack at tossing the Lombardi Trophy from one watercraft to another in a championship boat parade. Only this time, with more authority.

"I do think what I'd like to do is complete an overhand toss with the Lombardi Trophy," Brady told host Jim Gray on his weekly Let's Go! podcast Monday. "None of this Patrick Mahomes underhand throw that he always does. I've got to complete one overhand Lombardi Trophy toss in a boat parade. That would be a great way to get a new year started right."

Of course, the video of Brady's last such heave went haywire internationally, and remains one of the bay area's indelible images of 2021. That underhanded toss — from the stern of his custom boat — landed in the hands of tight end Cameron Brate, seated in another vessel about 10 feet away during the team's celebratory boat parade following Super Bowl 55.

So would an overhand throw require gripping the trophy from its pedestal, or the seams of the metal football, Gray asked.

"It depends on how much avocado tequila I have," Brady responded. "It's kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing."

As for other prominent tosses, Brady said he received a warning been from the NFL after hurling — and smashing — a Microsoft Surface Pro tablet in frustration while on the sideline during the Bucs' 9-0 home loss to the Saints two weekends ago. TV cameras captured the moment, which has since become a Twitter meme.
