How the Taliban stormed across Afghanistan in 10 days

From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, here's what happened.

First air strikes A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed.

New constitution After protracted negotiations at a "loya jirga" or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004.

Nato ends combat operations At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces.

Death toll announcement Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his country's security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought.

Date for final withdrawal US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021.
