Toomey, who once unified the GOP, now on the outs over Trump

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Before he became the object of fury of Republicans for voting to convict Donald Trump during the former president's second impeachment trial, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was once the insurgent from the right.

It is now Toomey facing angry rank-and-file state Republican Party committee members and the potential of a censure vote, a symbolic gesture that may have no real effect on the senator since he isn't seeking reelection next year.

Toomey, who once endorsed challenges to Republican officeholders who weren't seen as conservative enough, is now urging Republicans to be tolerant of a difference of opinion over whether Trump and his long campaign of falsehoods to discredit the election result is to blame for the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

"I understand that most Republicans probably disagree with the conclusion that I came to," Toomey said during a Thursday radio appearance on WPHT-AM in Philadelphia. "I don't think it's a good idea for the party to be deciding that they're going to censure a particular elected Republican over a particular vote, and I think it sends a bad message to the many Republicans, even if they're in the minority, the many Republicans who do agree with what I've done here."

Toomey last Saturday became one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump of "incitement of insurrection," even though the vote to convict ultimately fell 10 votes short of the two-thirds majority, or 67, necessary in the U.S. Senate.

The state GOP chair, Lawrence Tabas, promptly emailed state party committee members to tell them he was planning a meeting to discuss the Senate's action.

That meeting — if it happens — is expected to involve a censure resolution, as a wave of county parties have already voted to censure Toomey.
