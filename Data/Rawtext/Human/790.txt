Most eligible Americans have received their third stimulus checks but if you're still waiting, it may be on its way.

The IRS has sent more than 163 million stimulus payments since March. The most recent batch of payments, paid out on April 28, includes "plus-up payments," which are sent to people who received stimulus payments from the IRS based on their 2019 tax returns but are now eligible for a larger payment based on their 2020 returns.

The income limits and phase-outs where you won't receive a check have changed for this round, so we've created this calculator to help you estimate the amount you and your family might receive.

Calculator Methodology

We made the following assumptions based on the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021:

That the maximum "top-up" stimulus payment for adult and child dependents under the age of 17 is $1,400.

That adult dependents, who were left out of previous rounds of stimulus checks, will receive up to $1,400.

The phase-out applies to the full check total for a household. Phaseouts decrease proportionally by the dollar from the cutoff where you would receive the full check and the cutoff where checks were reduced to zero.

If your income is at the following amounts or higher, you won't receive a stimulus payment, even if you have dependents:

Single filers: $80,000

Married filing jointly: $160,000

Head of household: $120,000
