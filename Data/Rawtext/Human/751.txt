Alec Baldwin's first public appearance since 'Rust' shooting to be human rights event

Alec Baldwin is preparing for his first public appearance since the shooting on the set of his movie "Rust."

The actor has been spotted out-and-about on a number of occasions since the fatal shooting, and he even did a tell-all interview with George Stephanopoulos, but he has not yet been seen at any public events or red carpets.

That will change on Thursday, Dec. 9, as Baldwin will serve as the Master of Ceremonies for the 2021 Ripple of Hope Award event, put together by the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization in New York.

Per the event's website, the award has historically honored "exemplary leaders across the international business, entertainment, and activist communities who have demonstrated a commitment to social change and reflect Robert Kennedy's passion for equality, justice, basic human rights, and his belief that each of us can make a difference."

Additionally, a number of celebrities will be hosted as special guests at the event, including Dan Aykroyd, Jane Alexander, Peter Frampton, Marcia Gay Harden, Keegan-Michael Key, George Lopez, Mandy Patinkin, Martin Sheen, Alfre Woodard and more.

The in-person portion of the event will include a red carpet and a cocktail reception before dinner and the award program, which will be followed by dessert and more drinks, all at the New York Hilton Midtown Manhattan Hotel.

The virtual experience will allow attendees to access the award program, as well as a 30-minute conversation with a special guest for each table.
