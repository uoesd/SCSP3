Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Reportedly Working on a Book About "Leadership and Philanthropy"

Last week, it was announced Prince Harry had signed a $20 million deal with publisher Penguin Random House after secretly working on his memoirs over the past year. But now it seems that contract was, in fact, for a multi-book deal for both the Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan Markle.

According to Page Six, who first broke news of the royal couple's foray into the publishing world, their $20 million paycheck is actually for four future books, including one Harry and Meghan are working on together about "leadership and philanthropy." The Duchess of Sussex is also rumored to be working on a memoir of her own, as well as a book on "wellness." And despite reports Harry's memoir would be split in two with a second installment to be published after the death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, a spokesperson for the couple confirmed to the outlet just one book is scheduled to be released in late 2022.

In a statement about the memoir, Harry explained, "I'm writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become. I've worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story—the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned—I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think. I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what I've learned over the course of my life so far and excited for people to read a firsthand account of my life that's accurate and wholly truthful."
