The circular reckoning over 'missing white woman syndrome'

On Tuesday night, Chris Cuomo opened his show on CNN with an update on the case of Gabby Petito, a twenty-two-year-old travel blogger who went missing and whose body was found last month in Grand Teton National Park, in Wyoming. Brent Blue, a coroner in the case, had just ruled that Petito was strangled three to four weeks before her body was recovered—a finding, Cuomo said, that suggested a "crime of passion" and made it "more important than ever" that police find Brian Laundrie, Petito's fiancé, who is a person of interest in the case and currently unaccounted for. Cuomo invited a lawyer and a pathologist to discuss the case; he asked the latter how, exactly, a person dies by strangulation and how long it typically takes, and the former about the prospects for Laundrie's arrest. "Prosecutors have to make the case, every time out, beyond a reasonable doubt," Cuomo concluded. "This isn't about canceling somebody. This is about convicting them for a major felony."
