Leaders of pro-Trump groups Oath Keepers, Proud Boys subpoenaed in Jan. 6 Capitol riot probe

The House select committee investigating the deadly Capitol invasion said Tuesday it issued subpoenas to the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, two far-right organizations whose members were involved with the Jan. 6 attack. The committee also subpoenaed Proud Boys leader Henry "Enrique" Tarrio and Oath Keepers President Elmer Stewart Rhodes, along with 1st Amendment Praetorian, another organization involved with the lead-up to Jan. 6. The latest batch of subpoenas follows dozens of other requests from the House committee for documents and testimony from witnesses believed to have tangible connections to Jan. 6 and the events that precipitated it. The bipartisan panel is probing the facts and factors that caused the riot, when hundreds of former President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol, temporarily halting efforts to confirm President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory. The invasion followed months of false claims from Trump that the 2020 election was rigged against him. "We believe the individuals and organizations we subpoenaed today have relevant information about how violence erupted at the Capitol and the preparation leading up to this violent attack," select committee chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in a press release.
