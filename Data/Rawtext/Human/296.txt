On One-Year Anniversary of First COVID Vaccine in California, Governor Newsom Releases Latest "On the Record" Column Urging Californians to Keep Our Immunity Strong

SACRAMENTO – As California marks the one-year anniversary of the first COVID-19 vaccine administered in the state, Governor Gavin Newsom today released his latest "On the Record" ethnic media column highlighting California's nation-leading measures to slow the spread of the virus and the imperative to continue the state's progress with lifesaving boosters and vaccinations as we head into the winter months.

California has put more shots in arms than any other state – administering more than 62.7 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine – with 86 percent of all eligible Californians having received at least one dose and more than 6 million adults have received a booster.

"California has led the nation's fight against COVID-19 through robust vaccination efforts rooted in science and data. This has helped slow the spread of the virus and save countless lives, especially in our most vulnerable communities," wrote Governor Newsom. "It's critical that we keep our immunity strong, not just for ourselves, but for our communities...Californians have met every challenge with vigor and courage, and together, we will continue to lead the nation in the fight against COVID-19."

Amid an uptick in transmission since Thanksgiving, Governor Newsom urged all eligible Californians to get vaccinated and receive their booster – the most impactful steps we can take to protect ourselves and slow the spread of the virus. Boosters have been approved for those 16 and up who received the Pfizer vaccine at least six months ago, those 18 and up who received the Moderna vaccine at least six months before and those 18 and over who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least two months ago.
