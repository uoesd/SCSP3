Radio host Dave Ramsey slammed stimulus checks, and said you're 'already screwed' if $600 or $1,400 changes your life

Radio host Dave Ramsey said he's opposed to another round of stimulus check on Fox News.

"If $600 or $1,400 changes your life you were pretty much screwed already," he said.

Congress is working to pass another round of $1,400 checks.

Radio host and financial advisor Dave Ramsey said he was against another round of stimulus checks and those in need of them were already "screwed" during a Thursday morning appearance on Fox News.

"I don't believe in a stimulus check because if $600 or $1,400 changes your life you were pretty much screwed already," Ramsey said. "You got other issues going on."

Ramsey said those who need the money have problems with their careers, debt, relationships, or their mental health. and said the checks were simply throwing money at the problem or "peeing on a forest fire" but not fixing the issue.

"That's not talking down to folks. I've been bankrupt. I've been broke. I work with people every day who are hurting. I love people. I want people to be lifted up, but this is, again, it is just political rhetoric," he said.

Congress has been working towards another round of stimulus checks, with Democrats aiming to pass President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue package by early March.

Biden is in support of sending $1,400 checks to people making up to $75,000 a year.

The support comes as millions of Americans lose income and are financially strained due to the pandemic.

Jobless claims last week reached an unadjusted 793,000, the Labor Department said. There have been around 78 million claims for unemployment benefits, since the start of the pandemic last March.
