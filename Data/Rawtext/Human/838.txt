Tiger Woods returns home from hospital 21 days after car accident

Tiger Woods is back home.

Woods announced Tuesday evening that he has returned home to South Florida after a lengthy hospital stay spanning two Los-Angeles area facilities and 21 days following a serious car accident on the border of Racho Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills Estates, Calif.

"Happy to report that I am back home and continuing my recovery," Woods wrote in a statement released on his social media accounts. "I am so grateful for the outpouring of support and encouragement that I have received over the past few weeks."

The 15-time major champion has been largely quiet in the three weeks following the single-car accident in the days after hosting the Genesis Invitational. The crash shattered his right leg, resulting in comminuted fractures to the tibia and fibula bones in addition to injuries to the foot and ankle.

Two days after being admitted to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in the immediate aftermath of the crash, Woods was subsequently moved to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he underwent successful follow-up procedures to his injuries.

"Thank you to the incredible surgeons, doctors, nurses and staff at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center," he continued in his statement. "You have all taken such great care of me and I cannot thank you enough."

The 82-time PGA Tour-winner has been the subject of overwhelming support from the sports world over the last several weeks, including on the PGA Tour, where several pros wore his iconic 'Sunday Red' in tribute.

There's no public timeline for Woods' recovery from his injuries, nor further information about what they might mean for his future in competitive golf.

On his social media accounts, the 45-year-old gave no hints toward an answer.

"I will be recovering at home and working on getting stronger every day," his statement concluded.
