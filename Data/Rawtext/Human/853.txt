Why Tiger Woods Will Have A Hard Time Matching Golf's Original Comeback Kid, Ben Hogan

Before the 2019 Masters, when Tiger Woods had returned to the PGA Tour after years of debilitating injuries, he was asked if he thought a victory in the marquee tournament would rank as golf's greatest comeback.

Woods was coming off numerous back and knee surgeries and had not won a major tournament in 11 years. He was 43. But he knew his golf history as well as he knew the famed layout at Augusta National, where he had won four times, and set the record straight.

"One of the greatest comebacks in all of sports is the gentleman who won here, Mr. Hogan," Woods said of Ben Hogan, a two-time Masters winner who is universally revered and always referred to as "Mr. Hogan." Never "Ben."

Woods continued, "I mean, he got hit by a bus and came back and won major championships. The pain he had to endure, the things he had to do just to play, the wrapping of the leg, all the hot tubs, and just how hard it was for him to walk, period ... One of the greatest comebacks there is and it happens to be in our sport."

Woods won the tournament.

Ben Hogan has been dead for nearly a quarter-century, but his name has been trending this week in the wake of Woods' horrible car accident in California. Woods wasn't even out of surgery before speculation arose about another Tiger comeback, this time maybe even bigger than Hogan's. Woods is being held to a very high standard — that of the man who returned from a near-death experience to win seven majors in the next four years.

The two are inextricably linked both by history and success. Hogan was the dominant player of his era, which spanned from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s. Likewise, Woods ruled the golf world for more than a decade. Woods won more majors, but Hogan only competed in the British Open once (he won) and stopped participating in the PGA after winning it for a second time in 1948. Both men are on any serious fan's Golf Mt. Rushmore.
