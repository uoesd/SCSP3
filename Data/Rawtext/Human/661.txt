Kyle Rittenhouse Says He Will Attend Arizona State This Spring — University Says He Hasn't Applied

Topline

Kyle Rittenhouse, who was found not guilty last month on all counts in a trial for fatally shooting two at a 2020 protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, said Wednesday he will attend Arizona State University in-person this spring, but an Arizona State spokesperson told Forbes that Rittenhouse has not yet applied to the school.

Key Facts

On a Wednesday episode of the conservative podcast Louder with Crowder, Rittenhouse said he will enroll at ASU as an undergraduate degree-seeking student this spring, and wants to go to law school. Arizona State spokesperson Jay Thorne said in a statement to Forbes: "Mr. Rittenhouse withdrew from the two online courses for which he had signed up; he is welcome to apply for admissions and will be treated as any other applicant would be if and when he does." A representative for Rittenhouse did not immediately respond to Forbes' request for comment.

Key Background

Rittenhouse said on the stand November 10 that he was taking two online nursing classes at Arizona State, which the university confirmed at the time, though the university said he was "not currently enrolled" in any classes as of November 30. Rittenhouse said Wednesday he took a "compassionate withdrawal" from his two fall semester classes. News of Rittenhouse's Arizona State ties has caused controversy on campus, with 100 protesters rallying to demand the school not allowing him to attend last week, chanting phrases such as "Killer Kyle off our campus," while a similar number of Rittenhouse supporters tried to shout them down, according to the Associated Press.
