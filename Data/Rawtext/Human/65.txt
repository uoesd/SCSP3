QAnon shaman Jacob Chansley sentenced to 41 months in prison for Jan. 6 Capitol riot case

"QAnon shaman" Jacob Chansley, one of the most notorious figures of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, was sentenced Wednesday to three years and five months in prison for his role in the invasion of the halls of Congress by a horde of Trump supporters. "What you did was terrible," said Judge Royce Lamberth in federal court in Washington, D.C., even as he called Chansley's stated remorse for his crime genuine. "What you did was so serious that I cannot justify a" sentence lower than what was suggested by federal sentencing guidelines, Lamberth said. But Chanlsey's sentence was on the low end of the range of 41 months to 51 months in prison that were suggested by those guidelines. However, it also is tied for the longest sentence issued to date for any of the Capitol riot defendants who have pleaded guilty. "I was wrong for entering the Capitol. I have no excuse. No excuse whatsoever," Chansley told Lamberth. "The behavior is indefensible."
