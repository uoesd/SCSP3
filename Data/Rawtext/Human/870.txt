Rory McIlroy visited Tiger Woods and came away with a terrific story

AUGUSTA, Ga. — On the Sunday before he flew to Austin for the WGC-Match Play, Rory McIlroy went to see a friend.

Tiger Woods was at home recovering from his February car crash, and McIlroy knew his fellow Floridian would appreciate the visit.

"I spent a couple hours with him, which was nice. It was good to see him," McIlroy said. He was also encouraged by Woods' condition, describing him as in "decent spirits," which was a good sight to see given the severity of the accident.

"When you hear of these things and you look at the car and you see the crash, it's like, you think he's going to be in a hospital bed for six months," McIlroy said. "But he was actually doing better than that."

Any golf fan would love to have been a fly on the wall for that visit. What do two generational greats talk about when they're just hanging out? What did each say to the other?

In the Augusta National press room on Tuesday, it felt too personal to probe any further on that exact topic, so the conversation moved elsewhere. But in the final question of the press conference, I asked him about how he tries to peak for big events — whether he circles them on the calendar or treats them like any other event — and he circled back to his visit with Woods again, sharing a story that had the entire room enthralled.

"I think the circling them on the calendar is probably the best way to go," he said. "I was thinking about this. So I went over to Tiger's house a few weeks ago to see him, and in his family room he's got his trophy cabinet and it's his 15 major trophies. I said, 'That's really cool. Where are all the others?'

"He said, 'I don't know.' I go, 'What?' He said, 'Yeah, my mom has some and a few are in the office and a few are wherever.'"

Woods has famously won 82 PGA Tour events, tied for the most ever. So those 67 non-major trophies are just collecting dust? The moment stuck with McIlroy.
