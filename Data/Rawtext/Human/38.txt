Marine Who Escorted Lady Gaga at the Inauguration Shares Humorous & Heartfelt Backstory

The marine who escorted Lady Gaga ahead of her performance at President Joe Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration is opening up about both the lighthearted and heartfelt moments while — literally — supporting the pop star just before her delivery of "The Star-Spangled Banner."

Marine Capt. Evan Campbell was assisting other A-listers to their seats when he was asked to help 34-year-old Gaga, who was dressed in a custom Schiaparelli fitted jacket adorned with a symbolic dove brooch, to the microphone for her performance.

"There was a concern — obviously she was wearing this very beautiful, very large dress — and there was a concern that she might need some help getting down the stairs," Campbell told Task & Purpose this week. "So they basically looked around and I was one of the taller, larger individuals, and they just asked if I would be willing to assist and I was more than happy to."

Campbell, 34, told Task & Purpose that he didn't tell anyone he would be escorting Gaga before it actually happened, saying he "wanted to make sure that I didn't screw it up before I went hyping it."

In a separate interview with The Marine Corps Times this week, Campbell said he and the pop star "shared a laugh" ahead of their walk out: "She looked at me and she's like 'a fair warning ... we have an equal chance of tripping on this.' "

Sensing that Gaga was nervous, Campbell told Task & Purpose that he reassured her by telling her she would do a great job. She asked if he wanted to pray with her backstage inside the Capitol, in a touching moment that was captured in photos.

"It just seemed like a very natural human thing to do to look over and go, 'Hey you're going to do great. You always do well, you know, you're a performer, you're going to do great,' " Campbell told Task & Purpose. "It just seemed like she needed to hear a relaxed voice."
