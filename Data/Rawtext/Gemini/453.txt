Royal Revelations: Harry and Meghan Ink Multi-Book Deal with Penguin Random House

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have expanded their literary horizons with a multi-book deal with Penguin Random House, initially believed to be solely for Harry's memoirs. The deal, reportedly worth $20 million, now encompasses a joint project by the couple, a book on "leadership and philanthropy."

While rumors of Meghan's own memoir and a book on "wellness" persist, only one book by Harry is confirmed for release in late 2022, contrary to earlier reports of a two-part memoir. In his book, Harry aims to share his personal journey, highlighting shared human experiences and lessons learned.

Sources suggest that Meghan's potential memoir could hint at her political aspirations, building on her recent activism and advocacy work. The Duchess of Sussex recently welcomed her second child, Lilibet Diana, and has previously published a children's book titled 'The Bench,' described as a love letter to her husband and son, exploring tender aspects of masculinity.

The four-book deal with Penguin Random House does not include Meghan's previously published children's book. The couple's literary endeavors mark a significant departure from their royal roles, signaling their desire to share their perspectives and inspire others through the written word.
