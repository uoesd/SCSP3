ASU Students Protest Kyle Rittenhouse's Potential Enrollment

Arizona State University (ASU) students gathered on campus on Tuesday to protest the possibility of Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager acquitted of murder charges in the Kenosha shootings, becoming a student.

Around 100 students marched and chanted "Killer Kyle off our campus," expressing concerns about his admission given his trial and charges. "We don't want him on our campus," said ASU freshman Zein Hajaig. "He's a danger to students."

However, ASU administration clarified that Rittenhouse is not currently enrolled and has not gone through the admissions process. University spokesman Jay Thorne stated that criminal history is not considered during the admissions process for online classes. "Anyone who is qualified can apply for admission," Thorne said. "A guilty verdict would not prevent someone from being a student."

The protest also drew an equal number of Rittenhouse supporters, some of whom displayed support for Republican candidates. Former Republican Rep. Matt Salmon criticized the protest, urging respect for the judicial system and the rule of law. "We need to respect the outcome of the trial," Salmon said.

Student organizations have issued demands to ASU, including preventing Rittenhouse's re-enrollment, denouncing white supremacy, and supporting multicultural spaces. An online petition against Rittenhouse attending ASU has gathered over 15,000 signatures.

In media interviews, Rittenhouse has expressed a desire to pursue a career in nursing and attend classes on campus. However, his admission remains uncertain, as ASU has not yet made a decision on his application.

The protest highlights the ongoing debate over the role of criminal history in college admissions and the safety concerns raised by the presence of individuals with controversial pasts on campus.
