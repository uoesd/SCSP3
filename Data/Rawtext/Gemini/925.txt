MFA Showcases Artist Posters Highlighting COVID-19's Disproportionate Impact

The Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) in Boston is featuring a series of artist posters as part of Carrie Mae Weems's "RESIST COVID/ TAKE 6" project, which aims to raise awareness about the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on minority communities.

One of the posters, displayed prominently in the MFA's courtyard, features a black-and-white photo of a Black man wearing a mask and looking directly at the viewer. The image is accompanied by the text "RESIST COVID/ TAKE 6," a reference to the six feet of social distancing recommended by health officials.

"The poster is a powerful reminder of the racial inequities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic," said Kristen Gresh, senior photography curator at the MFA. "It's a call to action to address these disparities and to protect our most vulnerable communities."

The RESIST posters, fliers, and digital banners are being displayed across various public spaces in Boston and other major cities around the world. Edward Saywell, chair of the MFA's Prints and Drawings department, described the campaign as a "global movement."

"Weems approached us with the campaign in December, after starting work on it during the early lockdowns," said Saywell. "We were immediately drawn to the project's message of resilience and hope."

The campaign includes multiple messages, emphasizing systemic racism, violence, the importance of vaccination, and gratitude towards frontline workers.

"The poster is a dual message," said Gresh. "It speaks to the systemic violence that has been going on for centuries, and it also speaks to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black and brown communities."

Another poster in the series promotes vaccination as the best defense against the virus. It features a photo of a woman receiving a vaccine, accompanied by the text "Get Vaccinated. Protect Yourself. Protect Your Community."

"The project is a reminder of the power of collaboration and the role that public art can play in community connection and dialogue," said Saywell. "It also aligns with the MFA's commitment to making public art forms accessible from the street."

The MFA's display of the RESIST posters is part of a larger effort to engage with contemporary social issues and to make art accessible to a wider audience.

"We believe that art can be a catalyst for change," said Gresh. "We hope that these posters will inspire people to take action and to work towards a more just and equitable society."

The RESIST COVID/ TAKE 6 project is a powerful example of how art can be used to raise awareness about important social issues and to promote positive change. The MFA's display of the posters is a valuable contribution to this important conversation.
