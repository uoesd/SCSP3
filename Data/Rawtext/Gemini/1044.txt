Harris County Hit Hardest by Winter Storm, Study Finds

Harris County, Texas, bore the brunt of February's devastating winter storm, suffering more severe impacts than the rest of the state, according to a new study by the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs.

"Harris County was hit harder than any other county in Texas," said Renée Cross, Senior Director of the Hobby School. "The loss of power and water was extensive, and the death toll was tragic."

The study found that 66 people died in Harris County alone, nearly one-third of the almost 200 storm-related deaths in Texas. The majority of these deaths were due to hypothermia, carbon monoxide poisoning, and other cold-related causes.

"The storm exposed the vulnerability of our energy infrastructure and the need for better preparedness," said Mark P. Jones, Senior Research Associate at the Hobby School.

According to the study, 89% of Harris County residents surveyed lost electrical power during the storm, compared to 71% statewide. Residents also faced significant challenges with water outages, loss of internet, and difficulties obtaining food.

"Many people were without power for days, and some even lost water," said Cross. "This created a lot of hardship and anxiety."

The study also found that a high percentage of residents resorted to unsafe heating methods, such as using generators indoors or burning charcoal in their homes, risking carbon monoxide poisoning.

"It's clear that we need to do a better job of educating people about the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning," said Jones.

The survey also indicated that storm preparedness was inadequate, with 79% of respondents believing that power cuts were not equitably distributed.

"There was a lot of frustration and anger among residents who felt that they were not getting the help they needed," said Cross.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and Governor Greg Abbott received high disapproval ratings for their handling of the storm.

"ERCOT failed to adequately prepare for the storm, and Governor Abbott's response was seen as slow and ineffective," said Jones.

Despite cell reception issues, text alerts from local and county government were crucial for residents during the storm.

"These alerts provided people with important information about where to find shelter, food, and other resources," said Cross.

The study's findings underscore the need for increased investment in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, to enhance energy security.

"We need to move away from our reliance on fossil fuels and develop more sustainable energy sources," said Jones. "This will help us to avoid similar disasters in the future."
