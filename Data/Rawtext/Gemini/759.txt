Hollywood's Deadly Double Standard: Guns, Safety, and the Alec Baldwin Tragedy

The tragic on-set shooting involving Alec Baldwin has once again exposed the glaring hypocrisy and dangerous practices that permeate Hollywood's relationship with firearms. While the entertainment industry preaches gun control to the public, it recklessly endangers its own workers by using actual firearms as "prop guns" without adequate safety protocols.

SOFREP, a respected military and law enforcement news outlet, has meticulously analyzed the initial reports of the incident and identified a litany of safety failures. Among the most egregious is the lack of firearm safety knowledge and terminology accuracy in the original reports. The term "prop gun" is a misnomer, as the weapon used in the shooting was a real firearm, albeit loaded with blanks. This fundamental misunderstanding highlights the casual and cavalier attitude towards firearms that pervades the entertainment industry.

The article further questions the wisdom of using actual firearms as props, given the inherent risks involved. While blanks do not contain a projectile, they still produce a powerful blast that can cause serious injury or death at close range. The use of real firearms on movie sets is a relic of a bygone era and should be phased out in favor of safer alternatives such as airsoft or replica weapons.

Another glaring omission in the film's safety protocols is the lack of special training or licenses for the head armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed. In contrast, animal safety on movie sets is meticulously regulated, with dedicated animal handlers and veterinarians on standby. Yet, the person responsible for handling firearms, which are potentially far more dangerous than animals, is often given little more than a cursory briefing.

SOFREP also points out the cozy relationship between Hollywood and the firearms industry. Firearms are prominently featured and glorified in movies, often as symbols of power and masculinity. This glorification has contributed to a culture of gun fetishism that desensitizes the public to the real dangers of firearms.

The entertainment industry's hypocrisy on gun control is particularly galling. Alec Baldwin, the actor involved in the shooting, has been a vocal critic of the National Rifle Association (NRA). Yet, the industry he works in relies heavily on firearms for entertainment. This double standard is both morally repugnant and intellectually dishonest.

SOFREP proposes a solution to this dangerous situation: require armorers to be NRA Certified Range Safety Officers. The NRA has a long and proven track record of providing firearms safety training, including for police officers and concealed carry permit holders. By requiring armorers to undergo this rigorous training, the entertainment industry can ensure that firearms are handled safely on sets.

In addition to mandatory training, stricter state requirements and special liability insurance for those handling firearms in film productions are essential. This would create a strong incentive for producers to prioritize safety and minimize the risk of accidents.

The entertainment industry must also adopt serious safety standards similar to those for animal safety. This includes dedicated firearms safety officers, regular safety inspections, and a zero-tolerance policy for any violations.

The Alec Baldwin tragedy is a wake-up call for Hollywood. The industry can no longer afford to turn a blind eye to the dangers of firearms on movie sets. It is time to put safety first and end the reckless practices that have put lives at risk.
