Fired Ferguson Police Officer Protests with Rifle Outside Rittenhouse Courthouse

KENOSHA – A man identified as Jesse Kline, a fired Ferguson, Missouri, police officer, was spotted carrying an AR-15 rifle and yelling obscenities about Black Lives Matter outside the Kenosha County Courthouse during the Kyle Rittenhouse jury deliberations.

Kline, who initially identified himself as "Maserati Mike," confirmed he was a former member of the Ferguson Police Department, fired in 2018 over stalking charges that were later dropped. He had joined the Ferguson Police Department in 2015, following the shooting of Michael Brown, which sparked widespread protests.

Kline protested outside the Kenosha County Courthouse for three days, bringing a gun to the demonstration for a brief period. Kenosha County sheriff's deputies informed Kline he could not have the rifle near the courthouse due to its proximity to a school without a permit.

Kline voluntarily put away his rifle when informed of the Wisconsin law that prohibits knowingly possessing a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school's grounds. He continued to protest without the rifle, using a sound system to play music and a bullhorn, on subsequent days.

Kline claimed he traveled to Kenosha from Arizona for the demonstrations and described his current career as "an investor." Encountering public confrontation, Kline defended his right to protest and denied attempting to incite violence.

During his protest, Kline engaged in provocative behavior, including waving a large, apparent sex toy at the crowd.

Kline's presence and actions outside the courthouse drew mixed reactions. Some protesters expressed support for his right to protest, while others condemned his behavior as disrespectful and inflammatory.
