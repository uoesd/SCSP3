Trump Impeached for Second Time, Charged with Inciting Capitol Riot

WASHINGTON (AP) – President Donald Trump was impeached by the U.S. House for a second time Wednesday, charged with "incitement of insurrection" after the Capitol riot, in the most bipartisan presidential impeachment in modern times.

The House voted 232-197 to impeach, with ten Republicans joining Democrats. The impeachment came in response to Trump's role in inciting a mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, interrupting the certification of election results.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) cited a "clear and present danger" posed by Trump, urging lawmakers to uphold their constitutional duties.

"We know that the President of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country," Pelosi said. "He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love."

In a response, Trump released a video statement calling for unity and condemning the violence, without mentioning the impeachment.

"I want to be very clear: I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week," Trump said. "Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country."

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) indicated Trump committed impeachable offenses but has not decided how he will vote.

"The President of the United States has been impeached by the House of Representatives for high crimes and misdemeanors," McConnell said. "The Senate will consider the impeachment charges against the President and determine whether he should be convicted and removed from office."

The earliest the Senate could start an impeachment trial is the day before Trump's term ends, aiming also to prevent him from running again.

The impeachment resolution relies on Trump's incendiary rhetoric and falsehoods about the election outcome. It cites his speech on January 6, in which he urged supporters to "fight like hell" to overturn the results.

Security was tightened at the Capitol, including metal-detector screenings for House members, reflecting heightened concerns.

The impeachment proceeding drew on historical precedents, including the impeachment of War Secretary William Belknap in 1876 after his resignation.

Reactions from Lawmakers

House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) condemned the violence but opposed impeachment.

"I believe impeaching the President at this time would have the opposite effect of bringing our country together when we need to get America back on track," McCarthy said.

Third-ranking House GOP leader Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) supported impeachment, calling Trump's actions "a clear and present danger to our Republic."

"The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack," Cheney said.

Representative Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said the impeachment was necessary to hold Trump accountable.

"We cannot allow a President to incite an insurrection against our country and get away with it," McGovern said.

Representative Jason Crow (D-Colo.) said Trump's actions were "an attack on our democracy."

"We must hold him accountable for his actions," Crow said.

Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said Trump "must be removed from office immediately."

"He is a danger to our democracy," Waters said.

Representative Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) opposed impeachment, calling it "a political stunt."

"This is a partisan impeachment, pure and simple," McClintock said.

Reactions from Senators

Republican Senator Pat Toomey (Pa.) said Trump's actions were "impeachable offenses."

"The President's actions that day were a clear and present danger to our democracy," Toomey said.

Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) said she was "struggling" with the decision on whether to convict Trump.

"I take my constitutional responsibilities very seriously," Murkowski said. "I will be listening to the arguments presented by both sides and making my decision based on the facts and the law."

Historical Precedents

The impeachment of Trump is only the third time a U.S. president has been impeached. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Both were acquitted by the Senate.

The impeachment of War Secretary William Belknap in 1876 is a historical precedent for impeaching an official after their resignation. Belknap was impeached by the House after he resigned from office amid allegations of corruption. He was acquitted by the Senate.

Next Steps

The House impeachment resolution will now be sent to the Senate for a trial. The trial is expected to begin the day before Trump's term ends.

If convicted by the Senate, Trump would be removed from office and Vice President Mike Pence would become president. Trump would also be barred from holding federal office again.
