Brady Retires, Buccaneers Hand Reins to Mayfield

After a disappointing 8-9 season, Tom Brady has finally hung up his cleats for good. The legendary quarterback's departure leaves a gaping hole in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' offense, but the team has moved swiftly to fill the void by signing Baker Mayfield.

Mayfield Takes Center Stage

Mayfield, who spent the past season with the Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Rams, has inked a one-year deal with the Buccaneers worth up to $8.5 million. The former No. 1 overall pick brings a wealth of experience and a fiery competitive spirit to Tampa Bay.

Offseason Moves Bolster Roster

In addition to Mayfield, the Buccaneers have made several other key offseason moves. They re-signed cornerback Jamel Dean and linebacker Lavonte David, two stalwarts of their defense. They also added running back Chase Edmonds, who will provide depth and versatility to the backfield.

Kancey Headlines Draft Class

The Buccaneers' 2023 draft class is highlighted by Pittsburgh interior defender Calijah Kancey, who was selected 19th overall. Kancey is a disruptive force who should make an immediate impact on the Buccaneers' defense.

Season Outlook and Betting Lines

Tampa Bay is set to open its season on the road against Minnesota on Sept. 10. The team's over/under win total is set at 6.5, indicating that oddsmakers are expecting a bounce-back season.

Understanding Buccaneers Betting Options

For those looking to wager on the Buccaneers, there are several types of bets available:

  • Point Spread: This bet involves predicting the margin of victory for one team. For example, if the Buccaneers are favored by 3 points, they must win by at least 4 points for a bet on them to cover the spread.
  • Over/Under (Totals): This bet involves predicting the total number of points scored in a game. For example, if the over/under is set at 45 points, a bet on the over would win if the teams combine to score 46 or more points.
  • Moneyline: This bet involves simply picking the winner of a game. The odds for each team will vary depending on their perceived chances of winning.
  • Props: These bets involve predicting specific player or team statistics, such as passing yards, rushing touchdowns, or interceptions.
  • Futures: These bets involve predicting the outcome of an entire season or event, such as the Buccaneers winning the Super Bowl or Mayfield leading the NFL in passing yards.

Example Bets

  • Point Spread: If the Buccaneers are favored by 3 points against Minnesota and you bet on them to cover the spread, they must win by at least 4 points for your bet to win.
  • Over/Under: If the over/under for the Buccaneers-Vikings game is set at 45 points and you bet on the over, the teams must combine to score 46 or more points for your bet to win.
  • Moneyline: If the Buccaneers are favored to win by -150 on the moneyline, you would need to bet $150 to win $100. If the Vikings are underdogs at +120, a $100 bet would win you $120.
  • Props: You could bet on Baker Mayfield to throw for over 250 passing yards against Minnesota. If he does, your bet would win.
  • Futures: You could bet on the Buccaneers to win the Super Bowl at +1000 odds. If they win, you would win $1000 for every $100 bet.
