Biden's Inauguration: Dignitaries Gather for Historic Ceremony

WASHINGTON – Dignitaries from across the political spectrum arrived at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday for the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States.

Former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton were among the notables in attendance, along with lawmakers, governors, and other officials. The ceremony took place on a chilly but sunny day, with the U.S. Marine Band providing musical accompaniment.

Invited guests were seated in widely spaced chairs for COVID-19 safety, surrounded by a heavy security presence. Former President Obama and South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn were seen greeting each other warmly. Congressional leaders and other notable figures took their places on the platform, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.

Former New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez was also present, as his fiancée, Jennifer Lopez, is set to perform at the ceremony. Notably absent was outgoing President Donald Trump, who became the first departing commander-in-chief since 1869 to skip his successor's swearing-in.

Vice President Mike Pence and former President George W. Bush were among the Republicans in attendance. Former President Jimmy Carter was the only former president not participating in the ceremony.

Former GOP senator Jeff Flake of Arizona emphasized the significance of the peaceful transfer of power and Biden's presidency. "This is a moment of great consequence," Flake said. "It's a moment where we can come together as a country and move forward."

The inauguration marks a new chapter in American history, as Biden takes the reins of a nation grappling with a global pandemic, economic challenges, and deep political divisions. The ceremony serves as a symbol of the country's resilience and the enduring strength of its democratic institutions.
