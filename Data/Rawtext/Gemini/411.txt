Juror Describes Relaxed Deliberations Leading to Unanimous Chauvin Conviction

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – Brandon Mitchell, a juror in the Derek Chauvin trial, has described the deliberations as relaxed and methodical, leading to a unanimous conviction.

Mitchell, the first juror to speak publicly, compared the emotional toll of the trial to attending a funeral every day. "It was like going to a funeral every day," he said. "It was very, very emotional."

The jury convicted Chauvin of second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. Mitchell highlighted the importance of video evidence and the testimony of Dr. Martin Tobin, a breathing expert, in reaching the verdict.

"The video was very, very important," Mitchell said. "It showed us exactly what happened."

Mitchell said the jury took a preliminary vote on manslaughter first, then moved on to third-degree murder, and finally agreed on second-degree murder.

"We wanted to make sure we got it right," Mitchell said. "We wanted to make sure we were unanimous."

Mitchell thought the defense's strategy of portraying bystanders as a threat was ineffective since they didn't appear hostile.

"They were not being aggressive," Mitchell said. "They were just concerned citizens."

Chauvin's choice not to testify did not impact the trial's outcome, according to Mitchell.

"We didn't need to hear from him," Mitchell said. "We had enough evidence."

The juror felt no pressure to reach a verdict to prevent potential violent protests.

"We were not influenced by anything outside the courtroom," Mitchell said. "We just looked at the evidence."

Mitchell was careful to hide his involvement in the trial from his basketball team and conversed little about the case with his family.

"I didn't want to influence anyone," Mitchell said. "I wanted to keep my mind clear."

Mitchell refrained from predicting the outcome for the other three officers charged in Floyd's death, suggesting their trials might present different challenges.

"Each case is different," Mitchell said. "We'll have to see what the evidence is."

Mitchell's account of the deliberations provides a rare glimpse into the jury's decision-making process in one of the most high-profile trials in recent history. His comments highlight the importance of evidence, the emotional toll of the trial, and the jurors' commitment to reaching a just verdict.
