Meijer, Moulton Defend Surprise Kabul Trip Amid Criticism

Amidst the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and the Taliban's swift takeover of the country, two congressmen, Peter Meijer (R-Mich.) and Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), have come under fire for their surprise trip to Kabul.

The lawmakers, both veterans, defended their actions, stating that they aimed to conduct oversight on the evacuation operation and assess the situation on the ground firsthand.

"We went to Kabul because we felt it was our duty to do so," Meijer said. "We wanted to see for ourselves what was happening and to make sure that the evacuation was being conducted in a safe and orderly manner."

Moulton echoed Meijer's sentiments, emphasizing the importance of their presence in Kabul. "We wanted to get a firsthand look at the situation and to make sure that the administration was doing everything it could to get Americans and our Afghan allies out of harm's way," he said.

The White House has claimed that over 100,000 people have been evacuated to safety since the Taliban's takeover. However, the situation on the ground remains fluid, with thousands of Americans and Afghan allies still stranded in the country.

Meijer and Moulton took pains to minimize the risk and disruption caused by their trip. They traveled without pre-announcing their visit, they said, to avoid potentially jeopardizing operations and people on the ground.

"We did not want to do anything that would put our troops or the people we were trying to help at risk," Meijer said. "We took every precaution to make sure that our trip was as safe and as low-profile as possible."

Despite their precautions, the congressmen's trip has drawn criticism from some quarters. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) labeled it a "dangerous" and "freelance" journey.

"This is not the way to conduct oversight," Pelosi said. "The administration has been working around the clock to evacuate Americans and our Afghan allies, and this stunt by these members of Congress put our troops and our mission at risk."

Moulton, however, defended the trip, highlighting the emotional strain on personnel at Kabul airport and critiquing President Biden's preparation for evacuations.

"The situation on the ground is chaotic and heartbreaking," Moulton said. "Our troops are doing everything they can, but they are overwhelmed. The administration needs to do more to support them and to get Americans and our Afghan allies out of harm's way."

The Biden administration and Pelosi have also criticized the trip, arguing that it potentially diverted resources from the evacuation effort.

"We have been focused on getting Americans and our Afghan allies out of Afghanistan, and this trip by these members of Congress was a distraction from that effort," a White House spokesperson said.

Politico reported that the lawmakers paid "out of pocket" for flights to the United Arab Emirates, then took military flights to and from Kabul.

Meijer and Moulton have stated their opposition to Biden's plan to meet an August 31 deadline for troop withdrawal. They argue that the U.S. should maintain a presence in Afghanistan until all Americans and Afghan allies have been evacuated.

"We cannot abandon our allies and leave them at the mercy of the Taliban," Meijer said. "We must stay in Afghanistan until the mission is complete."

Moulton echoed Meijer's sentiments, emphasizing the importance of completing the evacuation effort. "We cannot leave Americans and our Afghan allies behind," he said. "We must stay in Afghanistan until the job is done."

The Biden administration has defended its decision to withdraw troops by August 31, arguing that it is time for the Afghan people to take responsibility for their own country.

"We have been in Afghanistan for 20 years," a White House spokesperson said. "It is time for the Afghan people to stand up and defend their own country."

The situation in Afghanistan remains fluid, with the Taliban in control of most of the country and thousands of Americans and Afghan allies still stranded. The Biden administration is facing increasing pressure to extend the August 31 deadline for troop withdrawal, but it remains unclear whether the president will do so.
