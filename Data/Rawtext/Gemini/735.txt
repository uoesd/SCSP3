Tucson Officer Fired for Fatally Shooting Man in Wheelchair

TUCSON, Ariz. – A Tucson police officer has been fired for fatally shooting a 61-year-old man in a motorized wheelchair nine times from behind.

The incident occurred on November 29, 2022, after Richard Lee Richards was suspected of shoplifting a toolbox from Walmart and allegedly pulled a knife on an employee. Officer Ryan Remington, who has been with the Tucson Police Department for four years, was the officer who shot Richards.

The shooting took place as Richards was entering a Lowe's store, with surveillance and body camera footage capturing the event. Before the shooting, Remington, working off-duty as Walmart security, followed Richards and called for backup.

"This incident is deeply concerning and does not reflect the values of the Tucson Police Department," said Tucson Police Chief Chris Magnus. "Our officers are trained to use deadly force only when necessary to protect themselves or others from imminent harm."

Magnus said that Remington's actions violated department policy and training in the use of force.

"The use of deadly force in this instance was not justified," Magnus said.

Remington's attorney, Mike Storie, claimed that his client had no nonlethal options due to the placement of the wheelchair.

"Officer Remington was in a difficult position," Storie said. "He had to make a split-second decision, and he believed that deadly force was necessary to protect himself and others."

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero called the actions "unconscionable and indefensible" and supports the investigation.

"The use of deadly force against a man in a wheelchair is deeply troubling," Romero said. "We must hold our officers accountable for their actions and ensure that justice is served."

The Pima County Attorney's Office is reviewing the fatal shooting for possible criminal charges against Remington.

The incident follows another investigation involving an off-duty officer in Tucson. In October 2022, Officer Jonathan Jackson was placed on administrative leave after he allegedly shot and killed a man in a wheelchair who was suspected of stealing a bicycle.

The Tucson Police Department has come under scrutiny in recent years for its use of force. In 2021, the department settled a lawsuit with the family of Carlos Ingram-Lopez, who was shot and killed by police in 2020. The settlement included a $2.5 million payment and a requirement that the department implement reforms to its use-of-force policies.

The fatal shooting of Richards has reignited concerns about the use of force by police officers in Tucson.

"This incident is a tragedy," said Michael Wright, president of the Tucson chapter of the NAACP. "We need to have a full and transparent investigation to determine what happened and why."

The investigation into the shooting is ongoing.
