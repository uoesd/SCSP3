Jerry Rice Weighs In on the Great Quarterback Debate: Montana vs. Brady

In the ongoing debate over who is the greatest quarterback of all time, legendary wide receiver Jerry Rice has thrown his support behind his former teammate, Joe Montana.

During an appearance on 95.7 The Game's The Morning Roast, Rice discussed the merits of both Montana and Tom Brady, ultimately giving the edge to the 49ers icon.

"I'm going to go with Joe Montana," Rice said. "I think the game is different now than it was when Joe was playing. The game is a lot more wide open now. The quarterbacks are protected a lot more. It's just a different era."

Rice, who played with Montana for 10 seasons in San Francisco, highlighted the physical demands that quarterbacks faced in Montana's era.

"Back in the day, you could hit the quarterback. You could hit him late. You could hit him low. You could hit him high," Rice explained. "Now, you can't touch the quarterback. You can't even breathe on the quarterback."

The difference in eras, Rice believes, gives Montana an edge over Brady.

"Joe Montana played in a different era. He played in an era where the game was a lot more physical. He played in an era where the quarterbacks were not protected," Rice said. "I think that makes a big difference."

Rice's connection with Montana was undeniable. The duo combined for 386 receptions, 6,710 yards, and 67 touchdowns in 77 games together.

"Joe Montana was the best quarterback I ever played with," Rice said. "He was the most accurate quarterback I ever played with. He was the smartest quarterback I ever played with."

While Brady has won six Super Bowl championships over the past 20 years, Rice pointed to Montana's undefeated record in the Super Bowl.

"Joe Montana never lost a Super Bowl," Rice said. "He was 4-0 in the Super Bowl. He was the best quarterback in the biggest games."

Brady's postseason record is also impressive, with a 32-11 mark compared to Montana's 16-7 record. However, Rice believes that Montana's three Super Bowl MVPs hold more weight than Brady's four.

"Joe Montana was the best quarterback in the biggest games," Rice said. "He was the most clutch quarterback I ever played with."

Rice's loyalty to Montana is understandable, given their shared history and success. However, he also acknowledged the changes in the NFL that have made the game easier for quarterbacks.

"The game is different now," Rice said. "The quarterbacks are protected a lot more. It's just a different era."

The debate over Montana vs. Brady is likely to continue for years to come. Both quarterbacks have had incredible careers, and their legacies will be debated by fans and analysts for generations.

Ultimately, the choice between Montana and Brady comes down to personal preference. Some fans prefer the physicality and clutch play of Montana, while others appreciate the longevity and success of Brady.

As Rice said, "It's just a different era."
