Thune Decries 'Cancel Culture' in GOP, Defends Republicans Who Censured Trump

PIERRE, S.D. (AP) – U.S. Sen. John Thune on Tuesday criticized Republican activists and party leaders for engaging in "cancel culture" by censuring GOP senators who found former President Donald Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection.

Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, defended fellow Republicans who sided with Democrats, calling it a "vote of conscience" and warning against shutting out dissenting voices in the party.

"I think we need to be very careful about this cancel culture that's taking place," Thune said in an interview with The Associated Press. "We need to be a big tent party. We need to be able to accommodate a wide range of views."

The South Dakota Republican's comments come as the GOP grapples with its future in the wake of Trump's presidency. The party is divided between those who remain loyal to Trump and those who believe the party needs to move on.

Thune said he believes the party can unite behind a common agenda that focuses on economic growth, fiscal responsibility, and a strong national defense. He also said he believes Republicans are well-positioned to retake the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections.

"I think we're going to be in a good position to win back the Senate," Thune said. "I think the Democrats are overreaching on a lot of issues, and I think that's going to give us an opportunity to make gains."

Thune also discussed Republicans' priorities under President Joe Biden, the proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, and upcoming primary battles within the GOP.

On Biden's priorities:

"I think the president is going to have a tough time getting some of his more ambitious proposals through Congress," Thune said. "I think he's going to have to moderate his agenda somewhat."

On the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package:

"I think there's a lot of support for a relief package, but I don't think it needs to be as large as the president is proposing," Thune said. "I think we can get something done that's more targeted and more fiscally responsible."

On upcoming GOP primary battles:

"I think we're going to see some competitive primaries in some states," Thune said. "But I think that's a healthy thing for the party. It's going to give us a chance to have a debate about the future of the party."

Thune also criticized Trump's post-election actions as "inexcusable" and accused him of undermining the peaceful transfer of power. However, despite his criticism of Trump, Thune voted to acquit him in the impeachment trial, siding with most Republican senators.

Thune said he believes the party needs to move on from Trump and focus on the future. He suggested taking steps to assist GOP candidates who refrain from discussing conspiracies, praising Rep. Liz Cheney for her performance on most issues.

"I think we need to be very careful about the candidates that we nominate," Thune said. "We need to make sure that they're people who are going to represent the party well and who are going to be able to win elections."

Thune said he believes the party is well-positioned to retake the Senate, attributing this to perceived policy overreach by Democrats. He said he believes Biden might govern more moderately without pressure from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.

"I think the president is going to have to govern from the center," Thune said. "I think he's going to have to find a way to work with Republicans if he wants to get anything done."

Thune said he believes Republicans will focus on economic policy, fiscal responsibility, strong borders, and a tough China foreign policy. He said he believes the party can unite behind these priorities and win back the support of voters who have been alienated by Trump.

"I think we have a lot to offer the American people," Thune said. "I think we have a lot of good ideas. And I think we can win back the Senate and the White House if we focus on the issues that matter to voters."
