Pro-Trump Republicans Aim to Unseat GOP Incumbents Who Impeached Trump

In the wake of the January 6th Capitol riot, pro-Trump Republicans are mobilizing to defeat GOP incumbents who supported the former president's impeachment. Among the most vocal challengers are Chris Mathys and Jonah Schulz, who are inspired by the incumbents' votes to impeach or convict Trump.

"We need to send a message that we will not tolerate those who betrayed our president," said Mathys, a Republican challenging Rep. Peter Meijer (R-MI), who voted to impeach Trump.

Schulz, who is running against Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-WA), another impeachment supporter, echoed Mathys' sentiment. "We need to hold these politicians accountable for their actions," he said.

Eleven out of the 17 Republicans who supported Trump's second impeachment face reelection in 2022. Forty Republicans have already filed to challenge the 10 pro-impeachment GOP incumbents with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).

Trump has been selective with his endorsements, which could significantly impact the primary races. Incumbents rarely lose primaries, but Trump seeks to disrupt this norm, especially against those who defied him.

"President Trump is very focused on these races," said Taylor Budowich, a senior adviser to Max Miller, a Trump-endorsed candidate running against Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH), who voted to impeach Trump. "He knows that these incumbents betrayed their constituents, and he wants to see them defeated."

Trump has already endorsed Miller and rallied support for him outside Cleveland. Miller has embraced Trump's rhetoric, calling Gonzalez a "traitor" and a "RINO" (Republican in name only).

South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice faces the most primary challengers, with 11 opponents. Catalina Lauf, one of Rice's challengers, has criticized his impeachment vote, calling it a "betrayal of the people of South Carolina."

"We need a representative who will stand up for our values and not be afraid to fight for what we believe in," Lauf said.

Trump has also endorsed Kelly Tshibaka against Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial. Tim Murtaugh, a senior adviser to Tshibaka's campaign, said Trump is "fully committed" to defeating Murkowski.

"President Trump has made it clear that he will campaign against Murkowski," Murtaugh said. "He knows that she is a RINO who does not represent the values of Alaska."

The pro-Trump challengers face an uphill battle, but they are hoping that Trump's endorsement and the support of his base will give them a boost in the primaries. If they are successful, it would send a clear message that the Republican Party is still firmly behind Trump and his agenda.
