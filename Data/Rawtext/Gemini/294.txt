Geneva, 25 October 2021 - The World Health Organization (WHO) today released a statement following the ninth meeting of the WHO Emergency Committee on COVID-19, held on 22 October 2021.

The meeting focused on the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and emphasized the need for a risk-based vaccination approach. Committee members were also briefed on ethics and conflict of interest, global epidemiological updates, and vaccine equity issues.

"The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over," said Professor Didier Houssin, Chair of the Emergency Committee. "We need to continue to use all available tools to control the pandemic, including public health and social measures, vaccination, and research."
