Turkey Bans Twitter, Pinterest Ads Over Legal Compliance

Turkey has banned advertising on Twitter and Pinterest after the platforms failed to comply with a law requiring them to have a legal representative in the country. The law, passed in October 2023, demands social networks remove content at authorities' request and maintain a legal presence in Turkey.

Critics argue the law leads to censorship, especially after the government's media crackdown post-2016 coup attempt. Deputy Minister of Transport and Infrastructure, Omer Fatih Sayan, defended the law as a measure against "digital fascism."

"We are not against social media, but we are against digital fascism," Sayan said. "Abuse on social media is a crime, not a freedom."

Turkey threatens to reduce bandwidth for non-compliant social networks, potentially making them inaccessible. Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok have complied with the law by appointing local representatives, reiterating support for freedom of expression.

Amnesty International and Article 19 criticize the law as a tool for state censorship and warn against Turkey acquiring user data. "This law is a clear attempt to silence dissent and control online discourse," said Sarah Clarke, Head of Europe and Central Asia Programme at Article 19.

Turkey has imposed fines of 40 million Turkish liras (€4.4 million) on platforms that didn't comply with the law. The legislation was introduced shortly after President Erdoğan called for a "cleaning up" of social networks.

Key Provisions of the Law

The law requires social networks with over 1 million daily users in Turkey to:

  • Appoint a legal representative in the country
  • Remove content within 48 hours of a request from authorities
  • Store user data in Turkey
  • Provide authorities with information on users and their activities

Criticism and Concerns

Critics argue the law gives the government excessive control over online content and could lead to censorship. They also express concerns about the privacy of user data stored in Turkey.

"This law is a dangerous step towards authoritarianism," said Milena Buyum, Turkey Campaigner at Amnesty International. "It will give the government the power to silence dissent and control the flow of information online."

Government's Defense

The government maintains the law is necessary to combat misinformation and hate speech online. They also emphasize their commitment to privacy and rights.

"We are not against freedom of expression," Sayan said. "But we believe that social media platforms have a responsibility to prevent their platforms from being used for illegal activities."

Impact on Social Media Platforms

Twitter and Pinterest have not yet commented on the ban. Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok have complied with the law, but have expressed concerns about the potential for censorship.

"We believe that open and transparent dialogue is essential for a healthy society," a Facebook spokesperson said. "We will continue to work with the Turkish government to find a solution that protects freedom of expression while respecting the law."

International Reaction

The European Union has expressed concern about the law, saying it could undermine freedom of expression in Turkey. The United States has also raised concerns, saying the law could have a "chilling effect" on online discourse.

Conclusion

The ban on Twitter and Pinterest advertising is the latest development in Turkey's ongoing crackdown on social media. The law requiring social networks to have a legal representative in the country has raised concerns about censorship and privacy. It remains to be seen how the government will implement the law and whether it will lead to further restrictions on online freedom of expression.
