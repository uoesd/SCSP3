Ever Given Owner Blames Suez Canal Authority for Grounding

The owner of the Ever Given, the massive container ship that blocked the Suez Canal for six days in March, has blamed the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) for the incident and is contesting a $916.5 million compensation claim.

Shoei Kisen, the Japanese company that owns the Ever Given, has filed an appeal against the ship's detention and is arguing that the SCA allowed the vessel to enter the canal in bad weather and failed to provide adequate tug boat support.

"The SCA did not take the necessary measures to ensure the safe passage of the vessel," said Ahmed Abu Ali, a member of the legal team representing Shoei Kisen. "They allowed the ship to enter the canal despite the strong winds and failed to provide sufficient tug boat assistance."

The SCA has maintained that the Ever Given's grounding was due to a technical fault and has filed a compensation claim for the costs of the salvage operation and the disruption to global trade.

However, Shoei Kisen's lawyers argue that the SCA's actions do not qualify as a "salvage operation" under legal definitions, as the ship was not in immediate danger of sinking or being lost.

"The SCA's actions were more akin to a towage operation," said Abu Ali. "They simply towed the ship out of the canal, which is not a salvage operation."

The hearings over the ship's detention and the compensation claim have been taking place at the Ismailia economic court in Egypt. The court is expected to issue a decision on the case on Sunday.

In addition to contesting the SCA's compensation claim, Shoei Kisen is also seeking $100,000 in initial compensation for detention-related losses. The company claims that the SCA has been holding the ship for an unreasonable amount of time and has caused significant financial losses.

The grounding of the Ever Given in March caused a major disruption to global trade, with hundreds of ships stranded on either side of the canal. The blockage also led to a spike in shipping costs and delays in the delivery of goods.

The SCA has defended its handling of the incident, saying that it took all necessary steps to ensure the safe passage of the Ever Given. The authority has also said that it is entitled to compensation for the costs of the salvage operation and the disruption to trade.

The outcome of the court case will have significant implications for both Shoei Kisen and the SCA. If Shoei Kisen is successful in its appeal, it could avoid paying the compensation claim and could also be awarded damages for detention-related losses. If the SCA wins the case, it will receive compensation for the costs of the salvage operation and the disruption to trade.
