Facebook Outage Costs Company Nearly $100 Million

Facebook's massive outage on Monday, which lasted from approximately 11:30 a.m. ET to just after 7 p.m. ET, impacted Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, and is estimated to have cost the company roughly $99.75 million in revenue.

The loss was calculated based on Facebook's Q2 earnings, which averaged $319.6 million per day or $13.3 million per hour. While the financial loss is significant, it represents a minor impact in the context of Facebook's overall revenues.

The outage comes at a time when Facebook is facing scrutiny over its handling of misinformation and offensive content. Former product manager Frances Haugen revealed herself as the whistleblower in a 60 Minutes interview, accusing the company of choosing "profit over safety."

Haugen leaked internal Facebook research to the Wall Street Journal and lawmakers, claiming that Facebook deactivated safeguards against misinformation and offensive content after the 2020 U.S. presidential election. She linked the decision to deactivate these safeguards to the Jan. 6 Capitol Riots.

"Facebook has repeatedly misled the public about the safety of its platform," Haugen said. "The company has put its own profits before the well-being of its users."

Facebook has minimized the significance of the leaked documents, saying that they "do not reflect the company's current policies or practices." However, the revelations have sparked calls for increased regulation of social media companies.

"This is a wake-up call for Facebook and other social media companies," said Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). "They need to be held accountable for the harm their platforms are causing."

The outage and whistleblower revelations have also had a negative impact on Facebook's stock price. The company's shares fell about 4.9% on Tuesday, following the release of the 60 Minutes interview.

Facebook is currently facing a number of lawsuits related to its handling of misinformation and offensive content. The company is also under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
