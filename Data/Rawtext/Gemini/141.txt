Cuomo Prime Time Plummets Amid Brother's Scandals

New York City, NY - "Cuomo Prime Time," the CNN show hosted by Chris Cuomo, has experienced a precipitous decline in viewership in recent weeks, coinciding with a series of scandals involving his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.

According to Nielsen data, "Cuomo Prime Time" averaged just 1.2 million viewers from April 5 to April 9, its lowest-rated week of the year. This represents a 45 percent drop compared to the week of January 25, when the show averaged 2.2 million viewers.

The decline in viewership has been particularly pronounced among adults aged 25-54, the key demographic for news programs. "Cuomo Prime Time" saw a 55 percent decline in viewership in this age group during the week of April 5-9.

The drop in ratings comes amid a series of scandals involving Governor Andrew Cuomo. The governor has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women and of covering up nursing home COVID-19 deaths. Chris Cuomo has also been implicated in the scandals, as he reportedly received prioritized coronavirus testing by his brother's administration.

CNN previously allowed Chris Cuomo to interview his brother on "Cuomo Prime Time," a decision that was widely criticized for lacking seriousness. Following the scandals, CNN announced that Chris Cuomo would no longer cover his brother on the show.

The decline in viewership for "Cuomo Prime Time" has been a boon for Fox News' "Gutfeld!," which has outperformed every CNN program since its premiere on April 5. "Gutfeld!" has also surpassed several broadcast network late-night shows in viewership.

The success of "Gutfeld!" suggests that viewers are looking for alternative news sources that offer a different perspective on current events. "Gutfeld!" is known for its irreverent and often comedic approach to the news, which may be appealing to viewers who are tired of the more serious tone of traditional news programs.

The decline in viewership for "Cuomo Prime Time" is a significant setback for CNN, which has been struggling to maintain its ratings in recent months. The network has been criticized for its perceived bias in favor of the Democratic Party, and its ratings have suffered as a result.

The scandals involving Governor Andrew Cuomo and Chris Cuomo have further damaged CNN's reputation, and it remains to be seen whether the network can recover from this latest setback.
