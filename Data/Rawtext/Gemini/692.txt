Crumbley Parents Accused of Ignoring Warning Signs Before Oxford High School Shooting

CNN – Prosecutors in the case against Ethan Crumbley, the teenager charged with terrorism and murder in the Oxford High School shooting, have accused his parents of ignoring signs that he was a threat and failing to prevent the tragedy.

Ethan Crumbley, 16, is accused of killing four students and injuring seven others in the November 30, 2021, shooting. His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, have been charged with involuntary manslaughter and have pleaded not guilty.

In a motion filed in court, prosecutors argue that the Crumbleys are flight risks, citing their financial troubles and previous attempt to flee. They also allege that the parents knew about Ethan's depression and fascination with guns but neglected his well-being.

"The defendants were aware of the defendant's disturbing behavior and mental health issues, including his fascination with guns," the motion states. "Despite this knowledge, the defendants failed to take any meaningful steps to address their son's mental health issues or to prevent him from accessing firearms."

Prosecutors allege that the Crumbleys were too consumed with their own lives to attend to Ethan, who exhibited disturbing behavior.

"The defendants were more concerned with their own personal lives than with the well-being of their son," the motion states. "They failed to provide him with the necessary supervision, guidance, and support."

Allegedly, Ethan's troubles were known to his parents; he was sadder than usual, tortured animals, and they bought him a gun despite this.

"The defendants knew or should have known that their son was a danger to himself and others," the motion states. "They failed to take any meaningful steps to prevent him from harming himself or others."

The filing criticizes the Crumbleys for not being more vigilant on the day of the shooting, especially since they had bought Ethan a gun.

"On the day of the shooting, the defendants were aware that their son had access to a firearm," the motion states. "They failed to take any steps to prevent him from using that firearm to harm others."

There's a mention of a drawing made by Ethan on the day of the shooting, showing a gun and a plea for help, which underwent 'modifications'.

"The defendants were aware of the drawing that their son had made on the day of the shooting," the motion states. "They failed to take any steps to prevent him from carrying out the threats that he had made in the drawing."

School officials had a meeting with the Crumbleys about Ethan's mental state but did not remove him from school, allowing him to attend classes.

"The defendants were aware that their son was struggling with his mental health," the motion states. "They failed to take any meaningful steps to address his mental health issues or to prevent him from accessing firearms."

"The defendants' actions and inactions directly led to the deaths of four innocent children and the injuries of seven others," the motion concludes. "They must be held accountable for their crimes."

Oakland County, Michigan, Chief Assistant Prosecutor David Williams said in a statement that the Crumbleys "failed to take reasonable steps to prevent their son from committing this horrific act of violence."

"They knew or should have known that their son was a danger to himself and others," Williams said. "They failed to take any meaningful steps to prevent him from harming himself or others."

The Crumbleys' attorneys have denied the allegations, saying that they are "loving parents" who did everything they could to help their son.

"The Crumbleys are innocent of these charges," said Shannon Smith, an attorney for James Crumbley. "They are loving parents who did everything they could to help their son."

The trial for the Crumbleys is scheduled to begin on October 24.
