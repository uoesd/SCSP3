Facebook Apologizes for Shutting Down French Town's Page Over Offensive Name

Facebook has apologized to the French town of Bitche after mistakenly shutting down its official page due to its name.

The town's page was deemed offensive by Facebook's algorithm and removed last month. The page's name, "Ville de Bitche," translates to "Town of Bitche" in English, but the word "bitche" is also a vulgar slang term for a female dog in French.

Facebook restored the page after widespread reports on the suspension. Mayor Benoît Kieffer expressed astonishment at how long Facebook took to correct the error.

"It's incredible that it took Facebook so long to realize their mistake," Kieffer said. "It's as if they don't have any human beings working there."

The page's removal was attributed to an incorrect analysis by Facebook's systems.

"Our systems incorrectly identified the page as violating our Community Standards," a Facebook spokesperson said. "We have restored the page and apologize for the error."

Bitche's official page was first unavailable on March 19, prompting the creation of an alternative page. Valérie Degouy, a spokesperson for Bitche, encountered challenges in contacting Facebook for a resolution.

"We tried to contact Facebook several times, but we didn't get any response," Degouy said. "It was very frustrating."

The town faced similar naming issues when first creating its Facebook page in 2016.

"We had to explain to Facebook that 'bitche' is the name of our town and that it has nothing to do with the vulgar term," Degouy said.

Following the page restoration, Mayor Kieffer invited Mark Zuckerberg and the president of Facebook France to visit Bitche.

"We would like to show them that Bitche is a beautiful town with a rich history," Kieffer said. "And we would like to remind them of the memory of the WWII liberators who called themselves 'sons of Bitche.'"

The invitation aims to honor the memory of the American soldiers who liberated Bitche from Nazi occupation in 1944. The soldiers adopted the name "sons of Bitche" as a playful reference to the town's name.

"The 'sons of Bitche' were heroes who fought for our freedom," Kieffer said. "We are proud of their legacy, and we want Facebook to know that their memory is important to us."

Facebook has not yet responded to the invitation.
