Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have shared the first official photo of their daughter, Lilibet 'Lili' Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, in their heartwarming holiday message. The adorable image captures the family of four, including their two-year-old son Archie, in a festive setting.

Lilibet, born on June 4, 2021, at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California, is named after Queen Elizabeth II, whose family nickname is Lilibet, and Princess Diana. She is the second child of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the fifth grandchild of Prince Charles.

The photo, released on the couple's Archewell website, shows Lilibet swaddled in a white blanket, her tiny hand resting on her father's finger. Archie, dressed in a blue sweater and jeans, beams with joy as he holds his baby sister.

In a statement accompanying the photo, Harry and Meghan expressed their gratitude for the warm wishes and prayers they received after Lilibet's birth. "We are incredibly fortunate to have her in our lives," they wrote.

The couple also shared a personal note on their website, thanking everyone for the love and support they have received from across the globe. "We feel incredibly lucky and grateful to have the support of so many people around the world," they wrote.

The inclusion of Lilibet's birth in their holiday message combines a personal moment with their public communications. It reflects the couple's desire to share their family life with the world while maintaining a sense of privacy.

Lilibet's arrival has brought immense joy to the royal family. Prince Charles, in a statement, said he was "overjoyed" to become a grandfather again. Queen Elizabeth II, who has met her great-granddaughter via video call, is said to be "delighted."

The birth of Lilibet marks a new chapter in the lives of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It is a testament to their love and commitment to each other and their growing family.
