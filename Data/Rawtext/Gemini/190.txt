Colonial Pipeline Resumes Operations, Fuel Shortages Persist

New York, NY - May 13, 2021 - Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, has resumed normal operations after a ransomware cyberattack forced its shutdown last week. The pipeline is now delivering millions of gallons of fuel each hour, servicing all its markets from Texas to New Jersey.

Despite the resumption, widespread fuel shortages persist, with up to 80% of gas stations in Washington D.C. still without fuel. The cyberattack, which forced the shutdown of about 5,500 miles of pipeline, led to widespread shortages and panic buying.

Colonial carries almost half of the fuel supply for the East Coast, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Operations restarted on Wednesday evening, but not immediately at full capacity.

Colonial paid nearly $5 million in ransom to the cybercriminals, as reported by an anonymous U.S. official. The cyberattack was coordinated by a group known as DarkSide, which has been linked to other high-profile ransomware attacks.

The Department of Energy led the federal response, in coordination with the FBI, Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense. The government agencies worked closely with Colonial to restore operations and mitigate the impact of the attack.

Colonial has committed to investing in resources to maintain safe and reliable operations. The company said it will enhance its cybersecurity measures and work with government agencies to prevent future attacks.

The cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline has highlighted the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber threats. The incident has prompted calls for increased investment in cybersecurity and stronger collaboration between government and industry.

The resumption of operations at Colonial Pipeline is a welcome relief for consumers and businesses. However, the fuel shortages are expected to continue for several days as the pipeline ramps up to full capacity.

Motorists are urged to conserve fuel and avoid panic buying. Gas stations are working to replenish their supplies as quickly as possible.

The cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline is a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity and the need for businesses to take steps to protect their systems from ransomware and other threats.
