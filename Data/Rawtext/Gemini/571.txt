Biden Addresses Progress and Challenges in Afghanistan Evacuation

My fellow Americans,

Today, I address you with an update on our ongoing efforts to evacuate American citizens, third-country civilians, Afghan allies, and vulnerable Afghans from Afghanistan.

Since I last spoke to you, we have made significant progress. We have secured the airport in Kabul, allowing flights to resume. We now have almost 6,000 troops on the ground, providing security and facilitating the evacuation process.

This is one of the largest, most difficult airlifts in history. Over 18,000 people have been evacuated since July, with around 13,000 since the military airlift began on August 14.

These evacuees include American citizens, permanent residents, their families, SIV applicants, and other vulnerable Afghans. We have also successfully evacuated all 204 employees of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal.

Flights in Kabul were briefly paused to process arriving evacuees but have now resumed. We are facilitating flights for our Allies and partners and working in operational coordination with NATO.

I want to emphasize that this evacuation mission is dangerous. We cannot guarantee that the final outcome will be without loss. However, we are committed to evacuating all American citizens and Afghan allies who wish to leave Afghanistan.

We are working around the clock to overcome operational challenges and coordinate with the Taliban to ensure safe passage to the airport.

I want to thank our brave service members who are carrying out this mission with courage and professionalism. I also want to thank our diplomats and aid workers who are working tirelessly to assist those in need.

We are grateful for the support of our Allies and partners in this effort.

I know that many Americans are deeply concerned about the situation in Afghanistan. I share your concerns. We are doing everything in our power to evacuate our citizens and Afghan allies and to support the Afghan people.

We will continue to provide updates as the situation develops.

Thank you.
