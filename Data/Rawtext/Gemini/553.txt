Biden Addresses Afghanistan Withdrawal, Defends Decision Amidst Rapid Developments

My fellow Americans,

Today, I address you with a heavy heart, as we grapple with the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan. The events of the past few days have unfolded with a speed and intensity that has taken many by surprise, including myself.

As your President, I have been closely monitoring the situation on the ground and have been receiving regular updates from our military and diplomatic personnel. I want to assure you that the safety and security of American citizens and our Afghan partners remain our top priorities.

We have been executing evacuation plans to bring our citizens, our allies, and vulnerable Afghans to safety. Our military and diplomatic teams are working around the clock to facilitate these evacuations, and we are committed to doing everything in our power to ensure the safe and orderly departure of those who need our assistance.

I want to emphasize that the original goals of our mission in Afghanistan were to combat al Qaeda and prevent terrorist attacks on the American homeland. We have achieved those goals. Al Qaeda has been decimated, and we have not seen a terrorist attack on American soil in nearly two decades.

However, over time, the mission in Afghanistan evolved into a broader effort to build a democratic and stable Afghan state. While we have made significant progress in many areas, it has become clear that nation-building in Afghanistan is not a task that can be accomplished by military force alone.

The current focus of our efforts must be on addressing contemporary threats to our national security. We have developed an over-the-horizon capability for counterterrorism efforts, which will allow us to continue to target terrorist threats in Afghanistan and elsewhere without a large-scale military presence on the ground.

I want to be clear that the decision to withdraw our troops from Afghanistan was not made lightly. It was the result of a careful and deliberate review of the situation on the ground, in consultation with our military and diplomatic experts.

Former President Trump negotiated an agreement with the Taliban that left the Biden administration with limited options. Under the terms of that agreement, the United States committed to withdrawing all of its forces from Afghanistan by May 1, 2021.

We have been working diligently to implement that agreement, while also ensuring the safety of our troops and our Afghan partners. However, the rapid collapse of the Afghan political leadership and military has made it clear that the conditions on the ground have changed dramatically.

The decision to withdraw our troops was not a decision to abandon Afghanistan. It was a decision to end a war that has cost the lives of thousands of American service members and countless Afghan civilians. It was a decision to bring our troops home and to focus on the threats of the future, not the challenges of the past.

I want to emphasize that American troops should not bear the burden of fighting in a conflict that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves. We have provided significant support to the Afghan military over the years, including training, equipment, and logistical support. However, we cannot instill the will to fight in others.

The Afghan leaders have failed to unite politically and to negotiate a political settlement with the Taliban. This failure has contributed to the rapid collapse of the Afghan government and military.

I want to acknowledge the pain and personal impact of the war in Afghanistan, especially for our veterans and their families. I have met with many of you over the years, and I have heard your stories of sacrifice and loss. I want you to know that your service and the sacrifices you have made will never be forgotten.

We owe a debt of gratitude to our veterans and their families for their service and sacrifice. We must never forget the brave men and women who have fought and died in Afghanistan.

As we move forward, we must learn from the lessons of the past. We must be clear-eyed about the challenges of nation-building and the limits of military power. We must focus on addressing the threats of the future, not the challenges of the past.

I want to assure you that I am committed to working with our allies and partners to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. We will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, and we will work to ensure that the Taliban uphold their commitments to protect human rights, including the rights of women and girls.

The United States will continue to be a beacon of hope and opportunity for those around the world who seek a better future. We will continue to stand with our allies and partners, and we will continue to fight for the values that we hold dear.

Thank you.
