Student Arrested for Shooting Threat, Bristol Borough Schools Closed

– Bristol Borough, PA – A student from Bristol Borough High School was arrested on Monday for making a shooting threat, leading to the closure of all Bristol Borough School District facilities.

"The threat was reported through the Safe2Say tip system, and it mentioned a plan to shoot up the high school," said Sgt. Joe Moors, acting leader of the borough police. "We take all threats seriously, and we acted swiftly to investigate."

With the assistance of the Bucks County District Attorney's Office and Bucks County Juvenile Probation Department, the police arrested the student early Monday morning. The student faces charges of making terroristic threats and disorderly conduct in juvenile court.

"No weapons were found with the student," Moors added. "However, the threat was specific and credible, so we had to take action."

The incident comes just weeks after a deadly shooting at Oxford High School in Michigan, where four students were killed.

"We are all too aware of the tragic events that have occurred in other schools," said Dr. Thomas F. Shaffer, acting superintendent of the Bristol Borough School District. "We are committed to providing a safe and secure learning environment for our students."

In a letter to parents, Shaffer announced that all schools in the district would be closed on Monday due to the threat. He said that the district would be working with law enforcement to ensure the safety of students and staff.

"We understand that this is a difficult time for our community," Shaffer said. "We want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to keep our schools safe."

The school district plans to reopen on Tuesday with an increased police presence. Counselors will also be available to support students and staff who may be affected by the incident.

"We are grateful to the Safe2Say tip system for allowing us to identify and respond to this threat," Moors said. "We encourage everyone to report any suspicious activity or threats to the authorities."
