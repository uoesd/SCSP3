Taliban in Talks with Qatar, Turkey on Kabul Airport Management

Kabul, Afghanistan - The Taliban are engaged in negotiations with Qatar and Turkey to establish a framework for the management of Kabul airport, aiming to facilitate commercial flights for those seeking to depart Afghanistan.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian stressed the significance of securing access to the airport, stating, "It is essential that the airport can function as soon as possible to allow the resumption of humanitarian aid and the departure of those who wish to leave the country."

The withdrawal of US forces has left Kabul airport without air traffic control services, creating a critical challenge. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a prohibition on American civil aircraft operating over Afghanistan without prior authorization due to ongoing security concerns and the absence of a functional civil aviation authority in the country.

During the evacuation of tens of thousands of people, the US military temporarily assumed responsibility for air traffic control in Kabul. However, a high-altitude jet route near Afghanistan's far eastern border remains open for US civil operators with FAA authorization.

Initially, the FAA permitted US air carriers and civilian pilots to fly into Kabul for evacuation or relief flights with the approval of the US Defense Department. US airlines have been actively involved in the evacuation effort, operating from airports outside of Afghanistan.

The Taliban's negotiations with Qatar and Turkey are seen as a crucial step towards restoring commercial air travel to and from Kabul. Qatar has played a significant role in facilitating diplomatic efforts in Afghanistan, while Turkey has expertise in airport management and security.

The resumption of commercial flights would provide a vital lifeline for those seeking to leave Afghanistan, including foreign nationals, Afghan citizens with visas, and those at risk from the Taliban. It would also enable the delivery of humanitarian aid and support the country's economic recovery.

However, security concerns remain a major obstacle. The Taliban have pledged to ensure the safety of the airport and its users, but the situation on the ground remains fluid. The FAA's prohibition on US civil aircraft operating over Afghanistan without authorization highlights the ongoing risks and challenges.

The negotiations between the Taliban, Qatar, and Turkey are expected to continue in the coming days, with the aim of reaching an agreement that will allow for the safe and efficient operation of Kabul airport.
