Gas Shortages Hit East Coast as Cyberattack Disrupts Pipeline

CLEMMONS, N.C. (AP) – A cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, a major fuel supplier to the East Coast, has left gas stations in over a dozen states without fuel, causing long lines and panic-buying.

Widespread Impact

The attack, which involved ransomware from a group known as DarkSide, has had a significant impact on gas station supplies in several states. Around 70% of gas stations in North Carolina, and about half in Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia were without fuel on Monday.

"We're seeing a lot of stations that are completely out of gas," said Stephen Brich, Virginia's highways commissioner. "We're asking people to conserve fuel and only fill up if they need to."

No Russian Involvement

U.S. officials do not believe the Russian government was behind the attack, but suspect the criminals are based in Russia. The FBI is investigating the incident.

Colonial Pipeline Restarts Operations

Colonial Pipeline has restarted operations but expects "several days" for fuel deliveries to normalize. The company said it is working to restore service as quickly as possible.

East Coast Delays, Not Shortages

The East Coast, which relies on the pipeline for 45% of its gasoline, has experienced delays rather than shortages. Officials expect gas station supplies to recover in a couple of weeks, assuming no further panic-buying.

Conservation Strategies

Virginia's highways commissioner announced conservation strategies due to the pipeline shutdown effects. These include reducing speed limits on interstates and encouraging carpooling.

States of Emergency

Virginia and North Carolina declared states of emergency to address the fuel shortage. Other governors urged against hoarding.

Impact on Daily Life

The gas shortage has affected various aspects of daily life. Emergency services have been impacted, as have entertainment venues.

"We've had to cancel several races because we don't have enough fuel to run our generators," said Sydney Marshall, general manager of South Georgia Motorsports Park and Orlando Speed World Dragway.

Medical Concerns

Dr. Chris Holstege, medical director of the Blue Ridge Poison Center at UVA Health, warned against using alternative fuels, such as charcoal or kerosene, to heat homes. These fuels can release toxic fumes that can be deadly.

Governor's Statements

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper urged residents to remain calm and avoid panic-buying.

"We are working with our partners to ensure that fuel is being delivered to our state as quickly as possible," Cooper said. "In the meantime, I ask everyone to conserve fuel and only fill up if they need to."

Conclusion

The cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline has caused significant disruptions to gas station supplies in several states. While the East Coast is experiencing delays rather than shortages, officials are urging conservation and patience as fuel deliveries return to normal.
