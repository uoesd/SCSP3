Capitol Police Officers to Testify on January 6 Assault in Historic Hearing

Washington, D.C. - A special congressional committee investigating the January 6 storming of the US Capitol will hold its first public hearing on Tuesday, featuring harrowing testimonies from police officers who were brutally assaulted during the insurrection.

The hearing marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing probe into the deadly riot, which was spurred by former President Donald Trump's baseless claims that the November 2020 election was stolen. Five people died, and dozens of police officers were wounded during the attack.

"These officers put their lives on the line to defend our democracy," said Maryland Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat on the panel. "Their testimony will provide a firsthand account of the violence and chaos that unfolded that day."

The investigation has faced significant Republican opposition, with House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy pulling appointments to the panel after Democratic objections. Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed two Republicans critical of Trump to the panel, amid GOP attempts to discredit the probe.

"This is a partisan witch hunt," said Representative Louie Gohmert (R-TX). "The Democrats are trying to use this hearing to score political points."

Despite the political divide, four police officers are set to testify about their brutal experiences during the riot: Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, Capitol Police Officer Aquilino Gonell, Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, and Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges.

"I was beaten, tased, and dragged down the Capitol steps," said Dunn. "I thought I was going to die."

Gonell described being crushed by a mob and losing consciousness. "I felt like I was being suffocated," he said.

Fanone was brutally beaten and suffered a heart attack during the attack. "I was screaming for help, but no one would come," he said.

Hodges was pinned against a door and nearly had his eye gouged out. "I thought I was going to lose my life," he said.

On the same day as the hearing, Republican legislators plan to hold a news conference to highlight the treatment of arrested rioters.

"The Democrats are ignoring the real victims of January 6," said McCarthy. "They're more concerned with punishing political opponents than with seeking justice."

Pelosi dismissed the Republican criticism, saying that the hearing is essential for understanding the full extent of the attack on the Capitol.

"We must never forget what happened that day," she said. "We must hold accountable those who were responsible for this violence."

The hearing is expected to shed new light on the events of January 6 and the role of Trump and his supporters in inciting the riot. It is also likely to further fuel the political debate over the depth of the investigation and the consequences for those involved.
