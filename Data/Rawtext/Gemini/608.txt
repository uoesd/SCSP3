Harris Focuses on Root Causes of Migration, Sidestepping Border Management

CNN – Vice President Kamala Harris is steering clear of direct involvement in managing the US southern border, instead prioritizing efforts to address the root causes of migration from Central America. President Joe Biden has entrusted Harris with leading initiatives in collaboration with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries to stem the flow of migrants.

Harris and her team are wary of being politically associated with the border situation, fearing it could be detrimental to their image. Republican critics and media outlets have framed Harris' immigration role as a border assignment, a characterization that has drawn her ire.

Undeterred, Harris is preparing for a trip to Guatemala and Mexico to engage in discussions on the underlying factors driving Central American migration to the US. Her mission includes securing commitments from private companies to invest in the Northern Triangle countries, a region plagued by poverty, violence, and corruption.

Officials and experts emphasize that addressing the root causes of migration cannot be divorced from the situation at the US-Mexico border. The pandemic and economic downturn have intensified migration from Latin America to the US, exacerbating the challenges faced by border patrol agents.

Harris is a pivotal figure for the Democratic Party, widely seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2024. She is eager to demonstrate her competence in fulfilling her newly assigned task. To this end, she has engaged with immigration advocates and regional experts to gather a comprehensive understanding of the migration issue.

Harris' approach differs from that of her predecessor, Mike Pence, who was tasked with managing the border. Pence focused on deterrence measures, such as building a wall and increasing deportations. Harris, on the other hand, believes that addressing the root causes of migration is a more sustainable and humane approach.

The Biden administration has faced criticism for its handling of the border situation, with Republicans accusing it of being too lenient. Harris' focus on root causes is seen as an attempt to shift the narrative away from border security and towards a more comprehensive approach to migration.

Harris' trip to Central America is expected to provide her with firsthand insights into the challenges faced by the region. She will meet with government officials, civil society organizations, and business leaders to discuss ways to promote economic development, reduce violence, and strengthen democratic institutions.

The success of Harris' mission will depend on her ability to secure concrete commitments from Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries. She will also need to demonstrate that her efforts are making a tangible difference in reducing migration flows.

Harris' focus on root causes is a long-term strategy that will require sustained engagement and resources. It remains to be seen whether she will be able to achieve her goals and whether her approach will ultimately prove more effective than traditional border management tactics.
