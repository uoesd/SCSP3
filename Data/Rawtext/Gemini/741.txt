'Rust' Crew Member Quit Over Safety Concerns Before Fatal Shooting

Los Angeles, CA - A former crew member on the set of the Western film "Rust" has revealed that he quit his job hours before the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins due to concerns over safety protocols.

Lane Luper, who served as the first camera assistant on the film, resigned in a letter to production managers, citing lax COVID policies, poor housing situations, and specifically gun safety concerns.

"I'm writing to you today to express my concerns about the safety of our cast and crew on the set of 'Rust,'" Luper wrote in his resignation letter. "There have been multiple safety concerns raised, and there have been several instances where I have felt unsafe."

Luper's resignation came just hours before Alec Baldwin discharged a prop gun, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. The incident has paused production on the film and sparked an investigation by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office.

"We are investigating this incident very thoroughly," said Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza. "We are looking at all aspects of this incident, including the possibility of criminal charges."

Investigators believe a real bullet was loaded in the firearm Baldwin used, which was supposed to contain only blank rounds. Assistant director David Halls, who declared the gun "cold" before handing it to Baldwin, has claimed ignorance of live rounds in the weapon.

The film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, is also under scrutiny. She has denied knowing the source of the live rounds and has said she checked the gun before it was given to Halls.

"We are still trying to determine how live rounds got on the set," said Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies. "We are not ruling out charges against anyone involved in this incident."

Three guns and about 500 rounds of ammunition, including live rounds, were found on set. The investigation is ongoing, and no charges have been filed at this time.

"This is a tragic incident, and our thoughts are with the victim's family and friends," said Carmack-Altwies. "We are committed to conducting a thorough and impartial investigation."

'Rust' producers have denied Luper's claims about ignoring safety concerns and budget issues. They have said that they are cooperating fully with the investigation.

"We are deeply saddened by this tragedy, and we are committed to ensuring that something like this never happens again," said a statement from the producers. "We are taking all necessary steps to improve safety on our sets."

The incident has raised concerns about safety protocols on film sets, and has prompted calls for stricter regulations.

"This incident is a wake-up call for the industry," said Luper. "We need to do better to ensure the safety of our cast and crew."
