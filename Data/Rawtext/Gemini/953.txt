Goldman Enters Race for New York Attorney General, Vows to Protect Democracy

Former federal prosecutor Daniel Goldman, who served as counsel to House Democrats during President Trump's first impeachment, has announced his candidacy for New York Attorney General. Goldman's campaign centers on fighting back against what he perceives as threats to democracy, including the ongoing influence of "Trumpism."

"We are facing an existential threat to our democracy," Goldman said in his campaign announcement. "Trumpism is not just a political ideology; it is an attack on the very foundations of our republic."

Goldman, 45, joins a potentially crowded field for New York AG, which includes Zephyr Teachout and state Sen. Shelley Mayer. If elected, Goldman promises to prioritize voting rights, reproductive rights, and combating climate change.

"The New York Attorney General's Office has a national reputation and authority," Goldman said. "We have a unique opportunity to lead the fight for justice and equality."

Goldman's career highlights include a major role in Trump's first impeachment trial and a 10-year tenure prosecuting organized crime and securities fraud. He emphasizes his dedication to civil rights and criminal justice reform as lifelong commitments.

"I have no ambitions beyond being 'the people's lawyer,'" Goldman said. "I am running for Attorney General to fight for the rights of all New Yorkers and to protect our democracy."

Goldman holds degrees from Yale and Stanford and is married with five children living in Manhattan. He has a background in history and law, with a particular focus on civil rights and criminal justice reform.

Goldman's announcement has been met with mixed reactions. Some praise his experience and commitment to public service, while others question his political motivations and his ability to unite a diverse electorate.

"Goldman is a highly qualified candidate with a strong track record of fighting for justice," said former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. "He would be a great Attorney General."

"Goldman is a partisan hack who is more interested in scoring political points than in serving the people of New York," said Republican Party Chairman Nick Langworthy. "He would be a disaster as Attorney General."

Despite the differing opinions, Goldman remains confident in his ability to win the election and make a positive impact as New York Attorney General.

"I am running for Attorney General because I believe that we can build a more just and equitable society," Goldman said. "I am asking for your vote because I believe that together, we can make a difference."
