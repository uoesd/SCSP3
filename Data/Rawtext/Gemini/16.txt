Biden Arrives in Washington for Inauguration Amid Heightened Security

WASHINGTON (AP) – President-elect Joe Biden arrived in Washington D.C. from Delaware on Tuesday, the eve of his inauguration as the 46th president of the United States.

Biden flew to Joint Base Andrews on a chartered plane, marking a contrast to President Donald Trump's arrival on a government plane in 2017. The decision to fly instead of traveling by Amtrak as originally planned was made due to security concerns.

"We're taking every precaution to ensure a safe and secure inauguration," said Gen. Daniel Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard.

Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are scheduled to attend a COVID-19 memorial at the Lincoln Memorial on Tuesday evening. Biden will spend the night at Blair House, the official guest residence for visiting dignitaries.

In a farewell address to Delawareans on Monday, Biden emphasized his connection to the state. "I'll always be a proud son of Delaware," he said.

Extremist Ties Prompt Removal of National Guard Members

The heightened security measures come after 12 Army National Guard members were removed from securing the inauguration after vetting by the FBI found extremist views or ties to right-wing militias.

"We are committed to ensuring that only those who are fully vetted and meet the highest standards of professionalism and loyalty will be involved in securing the inauguration," Hokanson said.

No specific plot against Biden was found as reasons for the removal of two National Guard members, according to a defense official.

Trump Prays for Success of Biden Administration

In his farewell address on Tuesday, President Donald Trump stated that he prayed for the success of the next administration.

"I pray for their success, and I also pray for the success of our country," Trump said.

However, Trump's remarks were overshadowed by the ongoing impeachment proceedings against him for inciting the January 6th attack on the Capitol.

McConnell Accuses Trump of Provoking Capitol Attack

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) accused Trump of provoking the Capitol attack, saying that Trump "provoked a mob to attack the Capitol in an effort to prevent the peaceful transfer of power."

Democrats Gain Senate Majority

Three new Democratic senators are set to be sworn in on Wednesday, giving Democrats a majority in the Senate. The new senators are Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, and Alex Padilla of California.

Biden also thanked the people of Delaware for their support throughout his career.

"I'm so grateful for the opportunity to have served as your senator and your vice president," Biden said. "I'll never forget the lessons I learned here, and I'll always be a proud son of Delaware."
