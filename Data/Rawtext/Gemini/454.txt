Harry and Meghan Ink $40 Million Book Deal with Penguin Random House

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have reportedly secured a lucrative four-book deal with Penguin Random House, worth an estimated $40 million. The deal includes a memoir by Harry, a wellness book by Meghan, and two other undisclosed titles.

A source close to the couple claims that one of Harry's books is planned to be released following the death of Queen Elizabeth II. However, a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan has denied these reports, stating that only one memoir by Harry is planned for late 2022.

Sources have expressed outrage at the suggestion that any book release would be linked to the Queen's death, calling it "appalling."

Meghan Markle's wellness book is expected to focus on her personal experiences and insights on health, mindfulness, and well-being. The subjects of the other two books in the deal remain undisclosed.

Harry reportedly led the negotiations from California, adopting a "take it or leave it" attitude. He allegedly demanded $25 million during negotiations, surprising the publishing team.

The deal, particularly Harry's memoir, has caused an uproar at Buckingham Palace. However, sources close to Harry say that the book represents his "truth" and that he is determined to share his perspective on his life and experiences within the royal family.

Meghan Markle's previous work, a children's book titled "The Bench," became a New York Times Bestseller. Her involvement in the four-book deal with Penguin Random House is seen as a significant step in her literary career.

The deal is a major coup for Penguin Random House, which has a reputation for publishing high-profile memoirs and biographies. The company is known for its ability to generate significant publicity and sales for its books.

The release of Harry's memoir is expected to be one of the most anticipated literary events of the year. It is likely to shed light on his relationship with the royal family, his decision to step down as a senior royal, and his life in California with Meghan and their children.

The other books in the deal, including Meghan's wellness book and the two undisclosed titles, are also expected to generate significant interest. The couple's decision to share their stories with the world is a testament to their desire to connect with their audience and to make a difference through their writing.
