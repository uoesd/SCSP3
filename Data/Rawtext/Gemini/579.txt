Afghan Baby Rescued from Kabul Chaos Finds Safe Haven in Phoenix

In the chaotic aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, a viral image emerged of an Afghan baby being passed over a wall outside Kabul airport to American troops. That baby, Liya, is now safely residing with her family in Phoenix, Arizona.

Liya, who was just 16 days old at the time of the incident, became a symbol of the desperate measures Afghan families were taking to escape the Taliban's takeover. Her father, Hameed, a linguist and cultural adviser who had worked with the U.S. military, arranged for her to be passed to the Marines after seeing his family needed assistance.

"I was holding her in my arms, and I saw the Marines on the other side of the wall," Hameed recalled. "I knew I had to do something to get her to safety."

Hameed briefly held Liya before handing her to another Marine to assist his wife, who had been robbed by the Taliban. The image of Liya being lifted over barbed wire went viral on social media, capturing the world's attention.

"It was a very emotional moment," said Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby. "We were all watching this unfold, and we were just hoping that this baby would be safe."

Liya was returned to her father and treated for an illness at a Norwegian hospital at the airport. Hameed called his daughter "a fighter" and is considering adding "Marine" as her middle name.

"She's a symbol of hope for the future of Afghanistan," Hameed said. "She's a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope."

The Marine who claimed to have lifted Liya over the wall, Lance Cpl. Hunter Clark, has been identified by the Marine Corps. However, the Corps denies that Clark was the one who assisted Liya.

Clark is under investigation for potentially violating Pentagon policies by speaking at a partisan event. His mother stated that he could not talk to the media due to the ongoing investigation.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding the identity of the Marine who helped Liya, her story serves as a testament to the compassion and bravery of the U.S. military during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Liya's family is now adjusting to life in Phoenix, where they are grateful for the safety and security they have found. Hameed is working as a security guard, while his wife is a homemaker. They are also receiving support from the local Afghan community.

"We are so happy to be here," Hameed said. "We are so grateful to the United States for giving us a new life."

Liya's story is a reminder of the human toll of war and the importance of providing refuge to those fleeing conflict. It is also a story of hope and resilience, as Liya and her family rebuild their lives in a new country.
