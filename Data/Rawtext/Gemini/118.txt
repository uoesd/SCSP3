Capitol Rioter Blames Fox News, Trump for Misinformation

Washington – Anthony Antonio, a Capitol riot defendant, has admitted to being influenced by false claims and misinformation from Fox News and former President Donald Trump, leading him to participate in the January 6 insurrection.

"I believed America was being robbed of a president," Antonio said in court documents. "I was misled by the false information about the 2020 election."

Antonio's lawyer, Joseph Hurley, introduced the term "Foxitis" to describe his client's condition after losing his job and consuming excessive Fox News content. "He was in a state of constant fear and paranoia," Hurley said.

Despite the widespread use of the "Trump defense" by Capitol riot defendants, judges have expressed concern about the role of right-wing media in inciting the violence.

Antonio expressed regret for his actions and acknowledged his mistake in not aiding DC Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who was assaulted during the riot. "I should have helped him," Antonio said.

Court documents detail Antonio's actions during the riot, including shouting at police, pouring water on an officer, and entering the Capitol. He has been charged with five federal crimes, including assaulting a police officer and obstructing an official proceeding.

The Justice Department has charged hundreds of individuals from 43 states and Washington, DC, in the massive federal inquiry into the insurrection. Federal prosecutors expect to charge at least 500 people in relation to the January 6 attack.

Antonio realized he had been misled a few days after the insurrection but takes full responsibility for his actions. "I was wrong," he said. "I should have known better."

The case highlights the ongoing debate over the role of misinformation and political rhetoric in inciting violence. As the Justice Department continues its investigation, it remains to be seen how the courts will address the issue of right-wing media's influence on the Capitol riot.
