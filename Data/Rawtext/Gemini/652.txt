Kenosha Democrats Push for Gun Law Updates After Rittenhouse Verdict

MADISON, Wis. (CBS 58) – In the wake of the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, Democrats in Kenosha are introducing a bill to update Wisconsin's gun laws for minors.

The proposed legislation would restrict minors from possessing long guns or rifles unless legally hunting. This move aims to close a loophole that allowed Rittenhouse, then 17, to carry a semiautomatic rifle during the Kenosha unrest in 2020.

"We cannot allow minors to carry dangerous weapons in public spaces," said State Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee), one of the bill's sponsors. "This bill is necessary to protect our communities and prevent tragedies like Kenosha from happening again."

Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all charges, including underage gun possession, which was dropped by the judge. However, the case has sparked a national debate about gun laws and the role of minors in protests.

Republican lawmakers have expressed opposition to the bill, arguing that it infringes on Second Amendment rights.

"This bill is an overreach by Democrats who are trying to chip away at our constitutional rights," said State Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point). "It would criminalize responsible gun ownership and make it harder for law-abiding citizens to protect themselves."

Testin also raised concerns about the bill's impact on school rifle clubs, which allow students to practice shooting under adult supervision.

"These clubs teach young people about gun safety and responsibility," Testin said. "This bill would put them at risk."

Democrats are also introducing a package of bills for safer gun storage and reporting of lost or stolen guns. The "Safe Storage for Gun Safety" plan aims to prevent gun violence and accidental shootings.

"We need to do more to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them," said Rep. Tod Ohnstad (D-Kenosha). "These bills will help us reduce gun violence and make our communities safer."

One of the bills would require gun owners to store their firearms in a locked safe or other secure location when not in use. Another bill would create a statewide database to track lost or stolen guns.

"These are common-sense measures that will save lives," said Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison). "We urge Republicans to join us in supporting these bills."

Republican leaders have expressed skepticism about the new measures, citing their opposition to past gun control proposals.

"We have consistently opposed efforts to restrict the rights of law-abiding gun owners," said Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester). "We will continue to stand up for the Second Amendment."

The debate over gun laws is expected to continue in the Wisconsin Legislature in the coming months.
