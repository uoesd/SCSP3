Gabby Petito's Body Found in Wyoming, Ruled a Homicide

Jackson, Wyoming - The body discovered in Wyoming on Sunday has been identified as Gabby Petito, the 22-year-old woman reported missing earlier this month. The initial manner of death has been ruled a homicide, according to Teton County Coroner Brent Blue.

"The cause of death is still pending final autopsy results," Blue said. "We are awaiting further information from the forensic pathologist."

The autopsy was performed after the body was found in Grand Teton National Park. The FBI Denver Field Office completed a forensic search of the Spread Creek Dispersed Campground, where Petito's body was discovered.

"We are asking anyone who was in the Spread Creek Dispersed Campground between August 27th and August 30th to contact the FBI," said FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Michael Schneider. "We are particularly interested in any information about a white Ford Transit van with Florida license plate QFTG03."

The FBI emphasized its commitment to holding those responsible for Petito's death accountable. "We are committed to finding Brian Laundrie and bringing him to justice," Schneider said. "He is a person of interest in Gabby Petito's death."

Petito's family attorney, Richard Benson Stafford, thanked the press for giving the family time to grieve. "The family is devastated by the loss of Gabby," Stafford said. "They are asking for privacy at this time. We will be releasing a statement in the coming days."

Investigators are searching for Petito's fiancé, Brian Laundrie, in Florida's Carlton Reserve. His whereabouts remain unknown.

On August 12, police responded to a domestic dispute between the couple in Moab, Utah. The incident was classified as a "mental health break." Petito's last known contact with family was in late August. She was reported missing on September 11.

Petito and Laundrie were traveling cross-country in a white Ford Transit van when she disappeared. Petito intended to marry Laundrie, but her friend, Rose Davis, expressed profound disappointment and called Laundrie a "coward."

"Gabby was a beautiful soul," Davis said. "She didn't deserve this. Brian is a coward for running away and not facing the consequences of his actions."

The investigation into Petito's death is ongoing. The FBI is asking anyone with information to contact them at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324).
