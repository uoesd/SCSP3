Tiger Woods Hospitalized After Serious Car Accident

Golf legend Tiger Woods was involved in a single-vehicle accident in Los Angeles County on Tuesday morning, sustaining multiple leg injuries that required surgery.

The accident occurred shortly after 7 a.m. local time in the Rolling Hills Estates area, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Woods was the sole occupant of the vehicle, which sustained "major damage" in the crash.

"Tiger Woods was involved in a single-vehicle accident this morning in California," said Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent. "He is currently undergoing surgery for multiple leg injuries."

A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department confirmed that Woods was extricated from the vehicle using the "jaws of life" and transported to a local hospital.

Woods was in California for the Genesis Invitational, a PGA Tour event he hosts while recovering from back surgery. On Monday, he was spotted playing golf with former NBA star Dwyane Wade and actor David Spade. Wade shared a photo of their outing on Instagram, showing Woods hitting a shot.

"We were just hanging out, having a good time," Wade said after hearing about the accident. "He was in a great mood. He was just happy to be out there playing golf."

Spade also expressed his concern for Woods. "I'm just praying for him," Spade said. "He's a great guy, and I hope he's okay."

The PGA Tour released a statement acknowledging the accident and offering support to Woods.

"We are aware of the news that Tiger Woods was involved in a car accident this morning," the statement read. "We are awaiting more information when he is treated at the hospital. Our thoughts are with Tiger and his family at this time."

Woods has been a dominant force in golf for over two decades, winning 15 major championships and 82 PGA Tour events. He has been struggling with injuries in recent years, but was hoping to make a comeback at the Genesis Invitational.

The accident has sent shockwaves through the sports world, with many expressing their concern and well wishes for Woods.
