Imminent IS Attack Threat at Kabul Airport, UK Warns

LONDON, Aug 26 – The United Kingdom has received "very, very credible" intelligence of an imminent attack by the Islamic State (IS) at Kabul airport, prompting the British foreign ministry to advise against travel to the airport.

"The threat is credible, it is imminent, it is lethal," said British armed forces minister James Heappey. "We have been very clear that this is not a safe place to be."

The intelligence indicates that IS militants are planning a suicide bomb attack on the airport, where large crowds have gathered in recent days in an attempt to flee Afghanistan following the Taliban's takeover.

"We are advising people not to come to the airport, to move away from the airport, and to await further instructions," Heappey said.

The threat poses a significant concern for Western nations, which are relying on the Taliban for security outside the airport. The UK has evacuated over 12,000 people from Afghanistan and plans 11 more flights.

However, approximately 400 eligible individuals, mostly British or dual nationals, remain in Afghanistan. Heappey acknowledged that it may not be possible to evacuate everyone due to the worsening security situation.

"We are working with the Taliban to try and make sure that we can continue to evacuate people," Heappey said. "But I have to be honest with you, the security situation is deteriorating."

The UK government has urged British nationals to leave Afghanistan immediately if they can do so safely. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has advised against all travel to Kabul airport.

"The FCDO advises against all travel to Kabul Hamid Karzai International Airport. There is an ongoing and high threat of terrorist attack," the FCDO said in a statement.

The US government has also warned of a "specific, credible threat" at Kabul airport. The US Embassy in Kabul issued a security alert on Thursday, urging US citizens to avoid the airport.

"US citizens who are at the Abbey Gate, East Gate, or North Gate now should leave immediately," the US Embassy said in a statement.

The security situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated rapidly since the Taliban took control of the country on August 15. There have been reports of violence and looting, and the Taliban has imposed strict restrictions on women and girls.

Western nations are facing a difficult challenge in evacuating their citizens and Afghan allies from the country. The US has evacuated over 100,000 people from Afghanistan, but thousands more remain.

The UK government has said that it will continue to do everything it can to evacuate British nationals and Afghan allies from the country. However, the security situation is likely to continue to deteriorate in the coming days and weeks.
