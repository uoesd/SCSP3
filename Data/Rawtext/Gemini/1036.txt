Gas Prices to Spike in Rockford Amid Texas Cold Snap

ROCKFORD – A frigid cold snap in Texas is expected to drive up gas prices in Rockford and across the nation by 10 to 20 cents per gallon.

The extreme weather has disrupted oil production, with approximately 20% of the nation's refining capacity currently offline. All 254 counties in Texas are under a winter storm warning, bringing freezing temperatures and icy conditions.

"The cold weather has led to partial shutdowns at 11 refineries in Texas and one in Kansas," said Patrick DeHaan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at GasBuddy. "This has reduced gasoline production and caused a spike in wholesale prices."

The cold snap comes at a time when gas prices were already on the rise due to the lifting of COVID-19 travel restrictions and increased demand. In Illinois, the average price of gas is currently $2.77 per gallon, up from $2.48 last year.

The annual switch to summer-blend gasoline is also contributing to the price increase. Summer-blend gasoline is more expensive to produce and has a higher octane rating.

"We could see gas prices in Rockford reach an average of $3 per gallon by Memorial Day," DeHaan warned.

Refineries may take up to two weeks to return to full service after the cold snap subsides. This means that gasoline demand and prices may continue to rise into March and April.

"Motorists should expect to pay more at the pump in the coming weeks," DeHaan said. "The situation in Texas is likely to have a significant impact on gas prices nationwide."
