Blaire Erskine's Hilarious Facebook Outage Parody Video Goes Viral

Comedian Blaire Erskine has struck gold with her latest parody video, which humorously addresses the recent Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp outage that left millions of users stranded.

In the video, Erskine transforms into a deadpan Facebook spokesperson, delivering a tongue-in-cheek response to the outage and the reactions it elicited. She begins by mocking the #DeleteFacebook movement, which gained traction in the wake of the whistleblower revelations. "Oh, you're deleting Facebook now?" she asks incredulously. "Where were you when we were begging you to leave?"

Erskine then turns her attention to the sudden outage, implying that users' reactions were inconsistent. "You're all acting like you've never experienced a Facebook outage before," she says with a smirk. "It's like you've forgotten about the good old days when we had to actually talk to each other."

The comedian also takes a jab at the absence of Tom from MySpace, a figure who became synonymous with the early days of social media. "I know you're all missing Tom," she says with a mock-serious expression. "But let's be honest, he's probably just as confused as the rest of us."

Erskine concludes her video with a sarcastic remark about people forgetting their mom's birthdays without Facebook. "I'm sure you're all wondering how you're going to remember your mom's birthday now," she says. "Don't worry, I'm sure she'll understand if you send her a text instead."

Erskine, who recently joined the writing team for Jimmy Kimmel Live!, also shared her conspiracy theory that Facebook intentionally caused the outage. "Let's be real," she says with a mischievous grin. "This was a petty power move by Facebook. They're just trying to assert their dominance."

Erskine was unaware that Facebook was back online when she posted her video, which only added to the humor. "I'm still waiting for Facebook to come back online," she says at the end of the video. "But hey, at least I have my mom's birthday memorized."

In the past, Erskine's parody videos have confused some high-profile figures. However, she has yet to see prominent people mistake her latest video for reality. "I'm still waiting for Tom from MySpace to give me a nod," she says. "That would be the ultimate seal of approval."

Erskine's hilarious parody video has resonated with millions of users who were affected by the outage. It has been widely shared on social media, providing a much-needed dose of laughter during a frustrating time.
