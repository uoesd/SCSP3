Tennessee Man Pleads Guilty to Capitol Riot Charge

Nashville, TN - Bryan Wayne Ivey, a 45-year-old Tennessee man, has pleaded guilty to a minor protest-related charge stemming from his participation in the January 6 Capitol riot.

Ivey admitted to entering restricted areas of the Capitol and pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating, or picketing inside Capitol grounds. As part of his plea deal, he agreed to pay $500 in restitution to the United States.

"The defendant's conduct on January 6th was a direct assault on our democracy," said Leslie Goemaat, Assistant U.S. Attorney for D.C. "We will continue to hold accountable those who participated in this attack."

Ivey was arrested on March 4 in Tennessee on four charges related to the riot. The other charges were dropped as part of his plea deal.

A tipster identified Ivey from social media photos, leading to his arrest. Evidence suggested that Ivey did not break a window himself but watched another protester do so.

Ivey traveled to Washington, D.C., with his wife and brother, who did not enter the Capitol.

A sentencing hearing is scheduled for September 28, where Ivey could face up to six months in prison, a $5,000 fine, and/or up to one year of probation.

"Mr. Ivey is a first-time offender who made a mistake on January 6th," said Robert David Baker, Ivey's Middle Tennessee public defender. "We will present mitigating factors at the sentencing hearing that we believe will result in a fair and just sentence."

Ivey is the first defendant with Tennessee ties to plead guilty in connection with the January 6 riot.
