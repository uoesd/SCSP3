Four California Service Members Among 13 Killed in Kabul Airport Bombing

Los Angeles, CA - Four of the 13 U.S. service members killed in the suicide bombing at the Kabul airport on Thursday were from California, authorities confirmed.

The attack, which occurred during the evacuation process amid the Taliban takeover, claimed the lives of 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops, making it one of the deadliest days in the Afghan war.

The California victims were identified as Sgt. Nicole Gee, Lance Cpl. Dylan Merola, Cpl. Hunter Lopez, and Lance Cpl. Kareem Mae'Lee Grant Nikoui.

Sgt. Nicole Gee, a maintenance technician from Sacramento, posted a photo on Instagram a week before her death showing her love for her job. "I love my job," she wrote. "I love the people I work with. I love the mission we are on."

Lance Cpl. Kareem Nikoui, a graduate from Norco High School, will be honored on the 'Lest We Forget Wall' at the George A. Ingalls Veterans Memorial Plaza. His family described him as a "hero" who "died doing what he loved."

Cpl. Hunter Lopez, the son of Riverside Deputy Sheriff Alicia Lopez and Riverside Sheriff's Captain Herman Lopez, planned to become a Riverside County Sheriff's Deputy. His father said he was "proud" of his son's service and sacrifice.

Lance Cpl. Dylan R. Merola was from Rancho Cucamonga. A GoFundMe has been set up in his honor to support his family.

Governor Gavin Newsom praised the troops' heroism and offered condolences to their families. "These brave men and women were serving our country with honor and distinction," Newsom said. "Their sacrifice will never be forgotten."

The bombing was blamed on Afghanistan's offshoot of the Islamic State group, known as ISIS-K. It was the most lethal day for American forces in Afghanistan since 2011, with the death toll possibly changing as investigations continue.
