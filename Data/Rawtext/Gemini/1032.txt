Innergex Sues Citigroup for $100 Million Over Winter Storm Charges

April 21 (Reuters) – Canadian renewable energy firm Innergex Renewable Energy Inc has sued Citigroup Inc for over $100 million in charges related to a February winter storm that crippled Texas's power grid.

Innergex subsidiaries Shannon Wind and Flat Top Wind halted their wind turbines during the storm, impacting their power delivery agreements with Citi Energy. The winter storm caused nearly half of Texas's power plants to fail, leaving 4.5 million people without heat or light and leading to several bankruptcies.

The wind firms declared force majeure due to their turbines freezing, but allege Citi ignored these declarations and billed them for replacement power at inflated rates. Citi billed Shannon Wind $39.5 million and Flat Top Wind $79.3 million for electricity, amounts that exceed their projected annual revenues.

The lawsuits seek to prevent Citi from taking further action and claim that Citi "improperly defaulted" them with potential foreclosure on the projects. Citi argues that contract disputes should be resolved in New York courts under New York law, questioning the legitimacy of filing the cases in Texas.

BlackRock, a part-owner of one of the wind firms, declined to comment; Starwood Energy Group and Innergex have not commented.

The billed amounts for replacement power were $9,000 per megawatt hour, significantly higher than the contracted rates of roughly $22 to $26 per megawatt hour. The cases were filed in Harris County District Court, Houston, Texas.

The lawsuits highlight the ongoing legal battles over financial responsibility for the Texas power crisis. Several power generators have filed for bankruptcy, while others have faced lawsuits from customers and regulators.

The lawsuits also raise questions about the role of force majeure clauses in energy contracts. Force majeure is a legal doctrine that excuses a party from fulfilling a contract due to unforeseen circumstances.

The Texas power crisis has exposed vulnerabilities in the state's energy grid and raised concerns about the reliability of renewable energy sources during extreme weather events.

The lawsuits are expected to be closely watched by the energy industry and could have implications for future power purchase agreements.
