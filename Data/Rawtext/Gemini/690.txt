Lawsuit Filed Against Oxford School District for $100 Million in Damages

Dec 9 (Reuters) – A lawsuit seeking $100 million in damages was filed on Thursday against the Oxford Community School District and its officials for the deadly shooting at Oxford High School that left four students dead and seven others injured.

The lawsuit, filed by Michigan personal injury attorney Geoffrey Fieger, accuses the school district's superintendent, principal, and other staff of failing to act on prior knowledge of the shooter's threatening behavior.

"This shooting was entirely preventable," Fieger said in a statement. "The school district knew about this kid's disturbing online activity, and they did nothing to stop him."

The lawsuit alleges that school officials were aware of the shooter's threats of violence and that he had searched for ammunition online. However, they failed to properly respond to these threats or conduct a thorough search of his belongings.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Riley Franz, 17, who was injured in the shooting, and her sister Bella, 14. The sisters' parents, Jeffrey and Kelly Franz, are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

"Our daughters should have been safe at school," Jeffrey Franz said. "The school district failed to protect them, and now they are paying the price."

The lawsuit also criticizes the school district for assuring parents and students of safety despite knowing of the shooter's disturbing online activity.

"The school district repeatedly assured parents and students that the school was safe," Fieger said. "But those assurances were nothing more than empty promises."

The shooter's parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, are charged with involuntary manslaughter for providing him with a gun and ignoring warning signs.

The lawsuit against the school district is the latest in a series of legal actions filed in the wake of the shooting. Several other lawsuits have been filed against the Crumbleys and the gun manufacturer, Smith & Wesson.

The Oxford Community School District has not yet responded to the lawsuit.
