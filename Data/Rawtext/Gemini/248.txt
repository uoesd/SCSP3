FDA Expands COVID-19 Booster Eligibility to All Adults 18 and Older

Silver Spring, MD - Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the expansion of eligibility for COVID-19 booster doses to all individuals 18 years and older. This authorization applies to those who have completed their primary vaccination series with any FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine.

"This action is based on the latest scientific evidence, which demonstrates that a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine can significantly increase protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. "We strongly encourage everyone who is eligible to get a booster dose as soon as possible."

The FDA's decision was made after careful review of data from clinical trials and real-world evidence. The data showed that a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine significantly increased antibody levels and provided strong protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death.

"This expansion of eligibility will help to ensure that more people are protected from COVID-19," said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "We have streamlined the eligibility criteria and clarified who is eligible for a booster dose to make it easier for people to get the protection they need."

The FDA's authorization of booster doses for all adults 18 and older is based on an analysis of immune response data. The data showed that a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine significantly increased antibody levels and provided strong protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death.

"The data show that a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective in preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death," said Woodcock. "We strongly encourage everyone who is eligible to get a booster dose as soon as possible."

The FDA's authorization of booster doses for all adults 18 and older is an important step in the fight against COVID-19. The FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continue to emphasize the importance of vaccination and other precautions against respiratory pathogens.

"Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19," said Woodcock. "We urge everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated and get a booster dose as soon as possible."
