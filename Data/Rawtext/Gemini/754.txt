Boebert's Controversial 'Rust' T-Shirt Sparks Outrage

Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert has sparked outrage with her latest fashion statement, a t-shirt referencing the tragic 'Rust' film set shooting. The shirt, emblazoned with the message "GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE ALEC BALDWIN DOES," has drawn widespread criticism for its insensitivity towards the victim, Halyna Hutchins, and her family.

"It's unconscionable," said Marty Lindsey, an actor on the 'Rust' set. "It shows a complete disregard for the tragedy and the family of Halyna Hutchins."

The incident in question occurred in October 2021, when actor Alec Baldwin accidentally discharged a prop gun on the 'Rust' set, killing Hutchins. The incident has been the subject of ongoing investigations and legal proceedings.

Boebert's office has not commented on the matter. However, a similar t-shirt is available for purchase on an online store run by Donald Trump, Jr.

Boebert has a history of using clothing to make political statements. In the past, she has worn clothing with slogans such as "Let's Go Brandon" and "FJB."

This is not the first time Boebert has mocked Baldwin since the incident. The day after Hutchins' death, she tweeted, "Alec Baldwin is a murderer."

Lindsey, who is also from Colorado, expressed disappointment in Boebert's connection to the state. "It's especially upsetting that she's from Colorado, as is another actor who was impacted by this tragedy," he said.

The t-shirt has been widely condemned by members of the film industry and beyond. Many have called it disrespectful, insensitive, and a mockery of a serious tragedy.

The incident has once again highlighted the ongoing debate over gun safety in the United States. While Boebert's t-shirt may be seen as a provocative statement, it also serves as a reminder of the devastating consequences that can result from the misuse of firearms.
