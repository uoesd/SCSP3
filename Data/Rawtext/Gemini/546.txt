Berlin Heights Navy Medic Killed in Kabul Airport Bombing

KABUL, Afghanistan (WTVG) – Navy medic Max Soviak from Berlin Heights, Ohio, was among the 13 U.S. service members killed in a bombing at the Kabul airport on Thursday.

Soviak, a 2017 graduate of Edison High School in Milan, Ohio, was part of a team assisting with the evacuation of American citizens and Afghan allies. The attack, claimed by ISIS-K, also killed more than 170 Afghans.

"He was a good student, well respected," said Edison High School Superintendent Thomas C. Roth. "He was always willing to help others in need."

The U.S. Navy confirmed the death of a sailor in the attack but did not immediately release the victim's name.

"It is with a heavy heart that I learned of the tragic death of Navy medic Max Soviak," said Ohio Senator Rob Portman. "He was a hero who lost his life helping fellow countrymen and Afghan allies escape the chaos in Kabul."

Soviak's death has sent shockwaves through the Berlin Heights community. The local schools have lowered their flags to half-staff in his honor.

"Max was a great kid," said Roth. "He was always smiling and always had a positive attitude. He will be deeply missed."

Portman echoed the sentiment, saying, "Max's sacrifice will never be forgotten. We owe him and his family our deepest gratitude."

The community is planning a memorial service for Soviak in the coming days.
