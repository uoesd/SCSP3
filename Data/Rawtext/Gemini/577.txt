Suicide Bombing Kills Dozens at Shiite Mosque in Kandahar

ISLAMABAD – A suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Kandahar, Afghanistan, killed at least 50 people and wounded at least 100 on Friday, according to Taliban officials. The attack, the second major bombing in Afghanistan within a week, has raised concerns about the rise of militant groups in the wake of the Taliban's takeover of the country.

No group has yet claimed responsibility for the Kandahar attack, but a similar attack in Kunduz last week was claimed by the Islamic State. The Islamic State, which considers Shiite Muslims to be heretics, has frequently targeted Shiite places of worship in the past.

The bombing highlights fears that the Taliban, which now controls the entire country, is unable to control other militant groups, including Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. Just a day before the Kandahar mosque attack, a Taliban police chief was killed by the Islamic State in Konar province.

"This is a big crime," said Abdul Ghafar Mohammadi, a Taliban police commander in Kandahar. "We will find those responsible and bring them to justice."

The Taliban has ordered its fighters to arrest those behind the attack. "We condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms," said a Taliban spokesman. "We will not allow terrorists to destabilize our country."

Eyewitnesses described multiple explosions and gunfire at the scene of the attack. "I saw people running and screaming," said Abdul Jabar Karimi, a resident of Kandahar. "There was blood everywhere."

"I heard a loud explosion, and then I saw smoke and dust," said Murtaza Khaledi, another eyewitness. "I ran to the mosque, and I saw people lying on the ground, dead and injured."

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) condemned the attack, reporting a death toll of 30. "This is a horrific attack on civilians," said UNAMA chief Deborah Lyons. "We call on the Taliban to do everything in their power to protect civilians and bring the perpetrators to justice."

The Taliban faces immense pressure to maintain security nationwide. The group has promised to crack down on terrorism, but it remains to be seen whether it has the capacity to do so. The rise of militant groups, such as the Islamic State, poses a significant threat to the Taliban's rule and to the stability of Afghanistan.

Hafiz Abdul Hai Abbas, the health director for Kandahar province, said that the death toll from the mosque attack could rise. "We are still receiving victims at the hospital," he said. "The situation is very critical."

The Taliban has been criticized for its handling of the security situation in Afghanistan. The group has been accused of human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings. The Taliban has also been accused of failing to protect civilians from attacks by militant groups.

The Kandahar mosque attack is a reminder of the challenges facing Afghanistan. The country has been ravaged by decades of war, and the Taliban's takeover has not brought an end to the violence. The rise of militant groups, such as the Islamic State, poses a significant threat to the stability of Afghanistan and to the well-being of its people.
