Gabby Petito's Utah Travels Traced, Search Intensifies

SALT LAKE CITY – FOX 13 News Utah has created a timeline of Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie's travels in Utah, largely based on their Instagram posts. The couple's journey through the state included visits to Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, Mystic Hot Springs, Canyonlands, and Arches National Park.

Gabby Petito, 22, and Brian Laundrie, 23, embarked on a cross-country road trip in July, documenting their adventures on social media. Their travels in Utah began on July 10, when they visited Zion National Park. They then spent time in Bryce Canyon, Mystic Hot Springs, Canyonlands, and Arches National Park.

Gabby Petito used an app called AllTrails to document her hiking and driving activities, which often matched her Instagram posts. The last hike Gabby documented on AllTrails was in Mystic Hot Springs on July 24.

On August 12, the couple had an encounter with police in Moab, Utah. Body camera footage from the incident shows police responding to a report of a domestic dispute between the couple. The officers separated the couple and advised them to spend the night apart.

The last Instagram post from either Gabby or Brian was on August 25 from Ogden, Utah. The couple was reportedly seen leaving the Fairfield Inn and Suites near the Salt Lake City airport on August 24.
