Laundrie Family's Silence Unacceptable, Says Gabby Petito's Stepdad

Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming - Gabby Petito's stepfather, James Schmidt, has expressed his frustration and disappointment over the silence of Brian Laundrie and his family amidst the ongoing search for the missing 22-year-old woman.

"It's unacceptable that Brian Laundrie and his family are hiding behind an attorney and refusing to provide any information," Schmidt said. "They need to step up and do the right thing."

Petito has been missing since September 11, 10 days after Laundrie returned home alone to Florida. The couple had been traveling in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park when Petito vanished.

Laundrie has only communicated through a lawyer and has not provided information to the police. This has led to speculation that he may know more about Petito's disappearance than he is letting on.

"We're begging the Laundrie family to please help us find Gabby," Schmidt said. "She's a beautiful, kind-hearted young woman who deserves to be found safe and sound."

Police have named Laundrie as a person of interest in Petito's disappearance. An incident involving the couple on August 12 was deemed a "mental health crisis" by police.

Schmidt urged those who were in the same areas as Petito to review their photos for potential leads. "Any little piece of information could help us find Gabby," he said.

Petito and Laundrie documented their trip on social media until around the end of August. Their posts show them camping, hiking, and enjoying the scenery.

James Schmidt, Petito's stepfather, has been actively involved in the search efforts in Wyoming. He has been posting updates on social media and has been working with law enforcement to find Petito.

"We're not going to give up on Gabby," Schmidt said. "We're going to keep searching until we find her."

The search for Gabby Petito continues, and her family and friends remain hopeful that she will be found alive.
