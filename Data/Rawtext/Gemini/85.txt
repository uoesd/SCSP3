Capitol Breach Probe Uncovers Alleged Pre-Riot Tours, Targeted Attacks on Democrats

Washington, D.C. - Democratic members of Congress are intensifying their investigation into how rioters breached the Capitol with alarming ease and targeted the offices of liberal lawmakers during the January 6 insurrection. Speculation has emerged that members of Congress or their staff may have facilitated the breach by organizing pre-riot tours and removing emergency call buttons from offices.

Pre-Riot Tours and Removed Call Buttons

Over 30 members of Congress, led by Representatives Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) and Tim Ryan (D-OH), have signed a letter demanding an investigation into the alleged pre-riot tours and possible collaboration. They argue that rioters seemed to have specific knowledge of the Capitol's layout, targeting the offices of high-profile Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi.

"There is evidence that members of Congress or their staff may have been involved in facilitating the breach," said Sherrill. "We need to know who was responsible and hold them accountable."

Ryan added, "We have heard names of lawmakers who gave tours, but we need to verify this information before we can disclose it."

Claims of Republican Involvement

Claims from 'Stop the Steal' organizer Ali Alexander suggest involvement from Republican House members Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar, and Mo Brooks in planning the rally that preceded the riot. Alexander has alleged that these lawmakers provided tours of the Capitol and helped coordinate the attack.

"These members of Congress were involved in planning the rally and giving tours of the Capitol," Alexander said. "They knew what was going to happen and they did nothing to stop it."

Skepticism and Denials

Republican lawmakers have expressed skepticism and denied the allegations. Representative Tom Emmer (R-MN) called the claims "baseless" and "a witch hunt."

"There is no evidence to support these allegations," Emmer said. "This is just another attempt by Democrats to smear Republicans."

Representative Vern Buchanan (R-FL) echoed Emmer's sentiments, saying, "I have seen no evidence that any member of Congress was involved in the riot."

Ongoing Investigations

Investigations are underway by the House Sergeant at Arms, Senate Sergeant at Arms, and Capitol Police, but progress has been slow. Lawmakers and investigators have not disclosed specific evidence linking the tours to the riot or the targeting of specific offices.

Lack of Proper Credentials

Sherrill emphasized that without proper credentials from Congress members, the rioters could not have entered the Capitol.

"The Capitol is a secure building," Sherrill said. "You cannot just walk in without proper credentials. Someone had to have given these rioters access."

Targeted Attacks on Democrats

Representative Sara Jacobs (D-CA) pointed out that the rioters seemed to have specific knowledge of the locations of Democratic offices.

"The rioters went straight to the offices of Nancy Pelosi and other high-profile Democrats," Jacobs said. "They knew exactly where to go."

Unanswered Questions

As the investigation continues, many questions remain unanswered. Who organized the pre-riot tours? Were emergency call buttons removed from offices? Were members of Congress or their staff involved in facilitating the breach?

The answers to these questions are crucial to understanding the full extent of the security failures that allowed the Capitol to be breached on January 6.
