Evergreen's Strict Management Under Scrutiny After Suez Canal Blockage

Washington, D.C. - Evergreen Marine Corp., the operator of the cargo ship that blocked the Suez Canal for nearly a week, is known for its strict, top-down management style. The accidental blockage of the canal by the Ever Given ship has raised questions about the company's management practices and the suitability of large vessels for certain shipping routes.

Strict Management Style

Evergreen Marine was founded in 1968 by Chang Yung-fa, a Taiwanese businessman known for his disciplined management style. The company has grown to operate a fleet of 200 container ships, making it one of the largest shipping companies in the world.

"Evergreen has a very strict management style," said Stone Huang, Taiwan Managing Director of JAS Worldwide. "They have a very top-down approach, and they are very focused on efficiency."

Suez Canal Blockage

On March 23, 2021, the Ever Given, a 400-meter-long container ship operated by Evergreen, became wedged across the Suez Canal, blocking all traffic through the vital waterway. The ship was freed after about a week, but the incident caused significant disruptions to global trade.

Evergreen cited gusty winds as a reason for the ship's deviation from its course. However, investigations are ongoing to determine the exact cause of the accident, focusing on the operator, shipowner, weather, or the canal itself.

Management Style Shift

After Chang Yung-fa's death in 2016, a dispute over inheritance among his sons was reported. Observers suggest that the management style at Evergreen may have shifted from its original strictness.

"There has been some speculation that the management style at Evergreen has changed in recent years," said Liang Kuo-yuan, President of the Polaris Research Institute. "It is possible that the company has become less disciplined and more focused on short-term profits."

Reputation Impact

Despite the Suez Canal incident, Evergreen Marine's reputation is unlikely to be significantly damaged. The company has a strong track record of safety and reliability, with minimal accidents prior to this incident.

"Evergreen has a good reputation in the industry," said Cathy Chin, Chairperson of the Taiwan International Logistics & Supply Chain Association. "They are known for their reliability and their commitment to customer service."

High Demand for Sea Freight

The high demand for sea freight due to the COVID-19 pandemic is also likely to mitigate any negative impact on Evergreen's reputation.

"The demand for sea freight is very high right now," said Huang. "Even if Evergreen's reputation is damaged, they will still be able to find customers for their services."

Large Vessel Suitability

The Suez Canal incident has also raised questions about the appropriateness of large vessels for certain shipping routes. The Ever Given is one of the largest container ships in the world, and its size may have contributed to the difficulty in freeing it from the canal.

"The Suez Canal incident shows that we need to be careful about the size of ships that we are using," said Chin. "We need to make sure that these ships are able to navigate safely through narrow waterways."

Ongoing Investigations

Investigations into the cause of the Suez Canal blockage are ongoing. The results of these investigations will likely have implications for Evergreen Marine, the shipping industry, and the design of future cargo ships.
