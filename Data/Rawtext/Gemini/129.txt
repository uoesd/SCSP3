CNN's 'Cuomo Prime Time' Plummets to Record Lows Amid Host's Scandals

CNN's flagship primetime show, 'Cuomo Prime Time,' has experienced a precipitous decline in viewership, reaching its lowest point since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The show's host, Chris Cuomo, has been embroiled in a series of scandals involving his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who faces accusations of sexual harassment, verbal threats, and covering up nursing home COVID-19 deaths.

According to Nielsen data, 'Cuomo Prime Time' averaged 1.31 million viewers the week of March 15, down from its 2020 average of 1.8 million. The show also performed poorly in the key demographic of adults aged 25-to-54, averaging only 439,000 viewers compared to its 2020 average of 629,000.

The viewership decline comes as CNN falls behind Fox News in ratings. In February, Fox News averaged 2.3 million primetime viewers, while CNN averaged 1.3 million.

CNN has been criticized for allowing Chris Cuomo to conduct interviews with his brother during the pandemic, which some have seen as a conflict of interest. In March, CNN announced that Chris Cuomo would no longer cover his brother's scandals, citing a long-standing rule with a previous exception.

The scandals surrounding Governor Andrew Cuomo have also cast a shadow over CNN. CNN executive vice president Allison Gollust has prior connections to the governor, having worked as his communications director from 2012 to 2018.

Despite the scandals and bipartisan calls for his resignation, Governor Andrew Cuomo has refused to step down. He has denied the sexual harassment allegations and has said that he will not resign over the nursing home deaths, which he has blamed on federal guidance.

The scandals have taken a toll on Chris Cuomo's reputation and have damaged CNN's credibility. It remains to be seen whether the network can recover from the fallout and regain its position as a leading news source.
