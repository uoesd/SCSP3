Capitol Riot Suspect Garret Miller Detained After Incriminating T-Shirt, Social Media Posts

By Associated Press

Oklahoma City, Oklahoma - Garret Miller, a suspect in the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riots, has been arrested and remains detained after prosecutors cited incriminating evidence from his T-shirt and social media posts.

Miller was apprehended on January 20 wearing a shirt that read "Take America Back" and "I Was There, Washington D.C., January 6, 2021." Prosecutors argue that this attire, along with Miller's social media activity, demonstrates his involvement in the Capitol siege.

"The defendant's T-shirt is a clear indication of his intent to participate in the insurrection," said a prosecutor. "It is a symbol of his support for the violence that occurred that day."

Miller's social media posts further implicate him, as he admitted to entering the Capitol building and made threatening statements towards Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a Capitol police officer.

The prosecution alleges that Miller intended to disrupt the democratic process by bringing tactical gear, ropes, and a gun to the Capitol. He is accused of assaulting officers and engaging in civil disorder.

On February 12, a grand jury indicted Miller on 12 counts, including civil disorder and assaulting officers. He faced a federal magistrate judge in Texas and has been ordered to remain detained.

Miller's attorney, F. Clinton Broden, has requested his release, arguing that he has no history of violence and has expressed regret for his actions.

"My client is not a danger to the community," Broden said. "He is a family man who made a mistake. He deserves a chance to prove himself."

However, prosecutors maintain that Miller's actions were intentional and pose a threat to society.

"The defendant's conduct was not a mistake," said a prosecutor. "He planned and executed an attack on our democracy. He must be held accountable for his crimes."

Miller remains in jail in Oklahoma City after sustaining an injury, delaying his transport to Washington for trial.

The Capitol riot investigation continues, with hundreds of individuals facing charges related to the attack. The Justice Department has vowed to hold all those responsible accountable for their actions.
