Tiger Woods Suffers Serious Injuries in Los Angeles Car Crash

Los Angeles, CA - Golf legend Tiger Woods was involved in a serious car crash in Los Angeles on Tuesday morning, sustaining significant injuries to his legs.

According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Woods was driving alone in a Genesis SUV when he lost control and crashed into a median strip. The vehicle rolled several times before coming to a stop.

"The airbags deployed, which likely saved his life," said Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva. "It's very fortunate that Mr. Woods was able to come out of this alive."

Woods was rushed to Harbor-UCLA Medical Centre, where he underwent a lengthy surgical procedure on his lower right leg and ankle.

"Mr. Woods suffered significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity," said Änish Mahajan, Chief Medical Officer and interim CEO at Harbor-UCLA Medical Centre. "These included comminuted open fractures to both the tibia and fibula."

Mahajan explained that the fractures were stabilized using a rod, screws, and pins. Woods also underwent surgery to relieve pressure due to swelling in his leg muscles.

"Mr. Woods is currently awake, responsive, and recovering in the hospital," Mahajan added.

Deputy Carlos Gonzalez, the first officer on the scene, praised Woods' calmness and the role of his seatbelt in potentially saving his life.

"He was very calm and collected," Gonzalez said. "He was able to tell me his name and date of birth. He was very fortunate to have been wearing a seatbelt."

Police found no evidence of alcohol or substances influencing the crash. The investigation is ongoing.

Woods' injuries have sent shockwaves through the world of golf and beyond. The 15-time major champion is widely regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time.

"We are all very concerned about Tiger's condition," said PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan. "We wish him a full and speedy recovery."

Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren, and his two children are reportedly by his side at the hospital.
