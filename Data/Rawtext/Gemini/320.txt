Suez Canal Authority Raises Tolls by Six Percent, Exempts LNG Carriers and Cruise Ships

The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) announced a six percent increase in toll rates for most vessels transiting the canal, effective February 2022. The toll increase comes after a year of record traffic and despite the canal facing increased competition from other shipping routes.

"This decision was made after careful consideration of global economic conditions and competition," said Admiral Osama Rabea, Chairman of the SCA. "We are committed to maintaining the competitiveness of the Suez Canal while ensuring the sustainability of our operations."

The toll increase will not apply to LNG carriers and cruise ships. The rate for LNG carriers is being modified from 25 percent to 15 percent to support the growth of this sector. The SCA is also making efforts to support the restoration of cruise ship traffic, which has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"We understand the challenges facing the cruise industry and are committed to working with our partners to bring back cruise ships to the Suez Canal," said Admiral Rabea.

The Suez Canal set a new record for transits in October 2021, with 1,847 vessels passing through the waterway. The canal also saw a 12 percent increase in revenues during the first ten months of 2021.

"The Suez Canal continues to be a vital artery for global trade," said Admiral Rabea. "We are proud of the record we have achieved and are committed to continuing to provide our customers with the highest level of service."

The SCA is preparing for continued strong volumes and is upgrading its operations to enhance service. The authority is investing in new equipment and technology to improve efficiency and reduce transit times.

"We are confident that the Suez Canal will continue to play a major role in global trade for many years to come," said Admiral Rabea.
