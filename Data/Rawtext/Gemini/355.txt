Facebook Whistleblower Calls for Zuckerberg's Resignation, Citing Safety Concerns

At the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen urged CEO Mark Zuckerberg to step down, arguing that his continued leadership poses a barrier to the company's safety-focused transformation.

"I think Mark Zuckerberg should step down," Haugen declared in response to a question from journalist Laurie Segall. "I think that the company needs to be run by someone who is focused on safety."

Haugen's stance stems from Facebook's dual-class share structure, which grants Zuckerberg the majority of voting shares. This structure, she contends, gives him excessive control and hinders the implementation of meaningful safety measures.

"Mark Zuckerberg has 55% of the voting shares," Haugen explained. "So, he can do whatever he wants. He can ignore the board. He can ignore the shareholders. He can ignore the users."

Despite acknowledging Zuckerberg's significant influence, Haugen expressed hope for his personal growth and the company's future under new leadership. "I think Mark Zuckerberg is a smart guy," she said. "I think he can learn from this. I think he can grow. But I don't think he's the right person to lead the company right now."

Haugen's criticism extends to Facebook's (now Meta) prioritization of expansion over safety and fundamental systems improvement. "They've been focused on growth at all costs," she said. "They've been focused on making money at all costs. And they've ignored the safety of their users."

A Meta spokesperson dismissed Haugen's concerns, asserting that the company is committed to both innovation and safety. "We believe that innovation and safety go hand in hand," the spokesperson said. "We're committed to building a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone on our platforms."

Haugen's revelations have sparked widespread scrutiny of Facebook's operations and policies. She previously leaked thousands of pages of internal documents, highlighting her concerns about the social media firm's handling of misinformation, hate speech, and user privacy.

"I believe that Facebook has the potential to be a force for good in the world," Haugen said. "But I don't think that's going to happen under Mark Zuckerberg's leadership."

Despite Haugen's call for Zuckerberg's resignation, the company's stock performance indicates no immediate financial impetus for leadership change. Meta's stock has risen almost 21% this year, suggesting that investors remain confident in the company's long-term prospects.

Haugen emphasized that her actions were motivated by a deep concern for Facebook and its potential for positive impact. "I care about Facebook," she said. "I believe in its mission. But I don't think that mission is being fulfilled right now."
