Tragedy on 'Rust' Set Prompts Calls for Mandatory Gun Safety Training

In the wake of the tragic shooting on the set of the Western film "Rust," which claimed the life of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, voices are rising to demand mandatory gun safety training on film sets. Among the most vocal advocates is Shannon Lee, the sister of Brandon Lee, who died in a similar accident on the set of "The Crow" in 1993.

"This is not an isolated incident," Lee said in an interview with PEOPLE. "It's a systemic problem that has been ignored for far too long."

Lee believes that actors should be able to check guns themselves and ensure everyone's safety. "Actors are not props," she said. "We have a right to know what we're working with and to make sure that it's safe."

Lee expressed sympathy for Alec Baldwin, who accidentally killed Hutchins while rehearsing a scene with a gun that was believed to be safe and loaded with blanks. "I can't imagine what he's going through," Lee said. "But this is a wake-up call for the entire industry."

Brandon Lee's fiancée, Eliza Hutton, described the "Rust" incident as another "avoidable tragedy." "This could have been prevented," Hutton said. "There's no excuse for it."

Hutton urged the film industry to consider alternatives to real guns on sets. "There are so many ways to create realistic gunfire without putting people at risk," she said. "It's time to start using them."

Baldwin has been in contact with Hutchins' family and expressed concern for them. "My heart goes out to the family of Halyna Hutchins," Baldwin said in a statement. "I'm fully cooperating with the investigation and will continue to do so."

The accidental shooting occurred on Oct. 21, during a rehearsal on the "Rust" set. The gun, which was believed to be safe and loaded with blanks, contained real bullets. The investigation is ongoing, with no charges filed yet, but authorities are keeping "all options on the table."

The tragedy has sparked a renewed debate about gun safety on film sets. Many experts believe that mandatory gun safety training is essential to prevent future accidents.

"This is a wake-up call for the industry," said Paul Stekler, a former LAPD SWAT team member and firearms instructor. "We need to make sure that everyone who handles a gun on a film set is properly trained."

Stekler believes that actors should be able to check guns themselves and ensure everyone's safety. "Actors are not props," he said. "They have a right to know what they're working with and to make sure that it's safe."

The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) has already taken steps to address the issue of gun safety on film sets. In 2018, SAG adopted new safety guidelines that require all actors who handle firearms on set to receive safety training.

However, some believe that the guidelines do not go far enough. "The guidelines are a good start," said Stekler. "But they need to be more comprehensive and they need to be enforced."

The tragedy on the "Rust" set has brought the issue of gun safety on film sets to the forefront. It is now up to the industry to take action to prevent future accidents.
