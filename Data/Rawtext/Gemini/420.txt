Judge Finds Aggravating Factors in George Floyd's Death, Allowing for Longer Chauvin Sentence

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – A Minnesota judge ruled Tuesday that there were aggravating factors in George Floyd's death, allowing for a possible longer sentence for Derek Chauvin, the former police officer convicted of murdering him.

Judge Peter Cahill found that Chauvin abused his position as a police officer and treated Floyd with particular cruelty. He also noted the presence of children during the crime and Chauvin's role in a group during the offense.

"The defendant abused his position of trust and authority and treated Mr. Floyd with particular cruelty," Cahill wrote in his order. "The defendant's conduct was particularly egregious because Mr. Floyd was especially vulnerable due to his physical condition and the fact that he was being restrained by other officers."

Chauvin, who was convicted of three counts, including second-degree unintentional murder, will be sentenced on the most serious one. Legal experts speculate he is unlikely to receive more than 30 years when sentenced on June 25.

Prosecutors had asked for an upward departure in sentencing, citing Floyd's vulnerability and Chauvin's refusal to stop even after Floyd became unresponsive. The ruling gives Cahill the option to sentence Chauvin above the guideline range.

"The defendant's conduct was a gross abuse of authority and a violation of the public trust," prosecutors wrote in their motion. "The defendant's actions caused the death of Mr. Floyd, a man who was already vulnerable due to his physical condition and the fact that he was being restrained by other officers."

Cahill agreed with prosecutors on most points but did not find Floyd was particularly vulnerable due to his ability to struggle.

"The court does not find that Mr. Floyd was particularly vulnerable due to his physical condition or the fact that he was being restrained by other officers," Cahill wrote. "The court finds that Mr. Floyd was able to struggle and resist the defendant's efforts to restrain him."

Defense attorney Eric Nelson argued against the finding of aggravating factors, stating Chauvin was authorized to use reasonable force.

"The defendant was authorized to use reasonable force to effect the arrest of Mr. Floyd," Nelson wrote in his response to the prosecution's motion. "The defendant's use of force was reasonable and necessary under the circumstances."

Chauvin also faces federal charges alleging he violated Floyd's civil rights, which would run concurrently with any state sentence.

Experts Weigh In

Legal experts said the judge's ruling gives him more flexibility in sentencing Chauvin.

"The judge's ruling gives him the option to sentence Chauvin above the guideline range," said Mark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law. "This means that Chauvin could face a longer sentence than the presumptive sentence of 12.5 years."

Osler said the judge's findings of aggravating factors are significant.

"The judge's findings of aggravating factors are significant because they show that the judge believes that Chauvin's conduct was particularly egregious," Osler said. "This could lead to a longer sentence."

Nelson said he plans to appeal the judge's ruling.

"We respectfully disagree with the court's findings and will be appealing the decision," Nelson said.

Background

Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes. Floyd's death sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice.

Chauvin was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter on April 20, 2021.

The sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 25, 2021.
