Cuomo Caught Giving Peace Sign Amid Preferential COVID Testing Allegations

Amid allegations that he received preferential COVID-19 testing from his brother's administration, CNN host Chris Cuomo was photographed giving a peace sign while going to get a vaccine.

The incident occurred as Cuomo, dressed casually, was on his way to a vaccination center in the Hamptons. He had previously shared his experience with COVID-19 on his show.

The allegations against Chris Cuomo include that a top state physician visited his home to provide COVID-19 tests. Others allegedly receiving priority testing include Cuomo's mother, brother-in-law, and political associates.

Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi responded that the governor "wasn't aware of these actions."

"The governor has never asked for anyone to get special treatment," Azzopardi said.

However, an ethics complaint related to the preferential treatment has been filed by state Senate Minority Leader Rob Ortt.

"This is a clear violation of the public trust," Ortt said.

The situation is part of a broader investigation that could lead to impeachment proceedings against Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

County leaders claim that this preferential treatment occurred while requests for expanded testing in nursing homes were partially denied.

"It's outrageous that the governor's family and friends were given priority for testing while our most vulnerable residents were left waiting," said Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone.

The allegations against Chris Cuomo have further fueled the controversy surrounding his brother's administration. Gov. Andrew Cuomo is facing multiple investigations, including one by the state attorney general, into his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
