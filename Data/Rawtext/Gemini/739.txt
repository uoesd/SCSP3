Tragedy on the 'Rust' Set: Prop Gun Misfire Kills Cinematographer, Injures Director

Santa Fe, New Mexico - A tragic incident unfolded on the set of the Western film "Rust" on October 21, 2021, when a prop gun discharged, fatally wounding cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza.

The Rehearsal and the Fatal Shot

The cast and crew were rehearsing a scene after lunch on the Bonanza Creek Ranch set in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when the incident occurred. According to crew member Serge Svetnoy, Alec Baldwin, who was portraying a character in the film, was rehearsing with a prop gun when it discharged.

"I was standing next to the director, and when he yelled 'action' or 'cut,' I don't remember, but that's when the gun went off," Svetnoy recounted.

Confusion and Emergency Response

Assistant director Dave Halls handed the prop gun to Baldwin, announcing it as a "cold gun," implying it was safe and unloaded. However, the gun discharged, striking Hutchins and Souza.

"I heard a loud bang, and then I saw Halyna grab her chest," Souza said. "I ran over to her, and she was bleeding from her chest."

An unnamed script supervisor immediately called 911, reporting the accidental shooting and requesting immediate help. "We need an ambulance right now," the script supervisor said. "We had an accidental shooting on the set."

Tragic Loss and Investigation

Halyna Hutchins, 42, was airlifted to a hospital but was pronounced dead. Joel Souza suffered a gunshot wound but survived.

Investigators seized Baldwin's clothes and the prop gun, among other items, to gather evidence. The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office is leading the investigation, and the FBI is assisting.
