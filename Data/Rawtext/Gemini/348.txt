Evergreen's Shadow: The Legacy of Lost Toys and the Suez Canal Blockage

The Ever Given, a colossal 200,000-tonne cargo ship operated by Evergreen Marine Corporation, has become the latest vessel to dominate headlines after becoming wedged sideways in the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest commercial sea routes. The incident has brought renewed attention to Evergreen, a shipping giant with a history marked by both maritime mishaps and scientific discoveries.

In January 1992, an Evergreen-operated ship named Ever Laurel, owned by Technomar Shipping, encountered heavy storms during a voyage from Hong Kong to Tacoma, Washington. Amidst the tumultuous seas, 28,800 plastic toys were swept overboard, embarking on an extraordinary journey that would forever link Evergreen to the fate of these lost playthings.

The spill included 7,200 each of plastic red beavers, blue turtles, green frogs, and classic yellow rubber ducks. These toys, dubbed "friendly floatees" by oceanographers, have since become invaluable scientific tools, providing insights into ocean currents and climate patterns.

Donovan Hohn's captivating book "Moby-Duck" chronicles the true story of the toys lost at sea and the ship's identity discovery through old shipping schedules. The toys have traveled more than 27,360 kilometers, washing up on far-flung shores, from Alaska to Australia.

Evergreen currently operates a different ship named the Ever Laurel, built in 2012 and sailing between the Far East and South America. However, the legacy of the 1992 spill continues to resonate, highlighting the potential environmental impact of cargo ship mishaps.

Cargo ship spills are not uncommon in stormy weather, as evidenced by the recent loss of hundreds of containers from the One Apus north of Hawaii in December. These incidents underscore the need for robust safety measures and contingency plans to minimize the risks associated with maritime transportation.

The Ever Given's blockage of the Suez Canal has brought Evergreen back into the spotlight, but it is the company's unwitting role in the "friendly floatees" saga that has left an enduring mark on both the shipping industry and the annals of scientific discovery.

As the Ever Given remains stranded, blocking billions of dollars worth of trade, the story of the lost toys serves as a poignant reminder of the interconnectedness of human activities and the natural world. The toys, once destined for children's play, have become invaluable tools for understanding the vast and enigmatic ocean that surrounds us.

In the wake of the Suez Canal incident, Evergreen faces the daunting task of salvaging the Ever Given and restoring the vital waterway to full operation. The company's reputation, already tarnished by the 1992 spill, will undoubtedly be further tested by this latest maritime mishap.

However, the legacy of the "friendly floatees" offers a glimmer of hope amidst the challenges. These toys, lost at sea decades ago, have provided invaluable scientific insights and captured the imagination of people around the world. They serve as a testament to the resilience of nature and the enduring power of human curiosity.
