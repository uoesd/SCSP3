Assistant Director's History of Safety Neglect Leads to Tragic 'Rust' Shooting

The fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of "Rust" has brought into sharp focus the issue of safety protocols on film sets. In the wake of this tragedy, it has emerged that assistant director Dave Halls, who handed Alec Baldwin the loaded gun that killed Hutchins, has a history of neglecting safety measures on previous productions.

Carol Sutton's Injury on 'Freedom's Path' Set:

In 2019, Halls was working as an assistant director on the film "Freedom's Path" when actress Carol Sutton suffered an injury during a scene. According to first assistant camera operator Quinton Rodriguez, Halls failed to use a recommended crash pad for Sutton, who fell over and was injured.

"Dave didn't use a crash pad, even though it was recommended," Rodriguez told Rolling Stone. "Carol fell over and got hurt."

Sutton, who passed away at age 76 in December 2020, never fully recovered from her injuries.

Halls' Firing from 'Freedom's Path' after Gun Discharge:

The incident involving Sutton was not the only safety violation on the set of "Freedom's Path." Rodriguez recalled another incident where Halls failed to call "Cut" when a crew member was injured.

"There was an incident where a crew member was injured and Dave didn't call 'Cut,'" Rodriguez said. "He just kept rolling."

Halls was ultimately fired from "Freedom's Path" after a prop gun unexpectedly discharged, injuring a crew member.

Producers of 'Freedom's Path' Decline Comment on Sutton's Injury:

The producers of "Freedom's Path" declined to comment on the incident involving Carol Sutton. However, they confirmed that Halls was removed from the set immediately after the prop gun discharged on their film.

"We can confirm that Dave Halls was removed from the set of 'Freedom's Path' after a prop gun discharged," the producers said in a statement. "We take safety on our sets very seriously and are committed to providing a safe working environment for our cast and crew."

Halls' Continued Work in the Industry Despite Safety Violations:

Despite being fired from "Freedom's Path" for the gun discharge incident, Halls continued working in the industry. This led to the tragedy on the set of "Rust," where he handed Baldwin a loaded gun that was not supposed to contain live ammunition.

Rodriguez's Account of Gun Discharge on 'Freedom's Path' Set:

Rodriguez provided new details about the gun discharge incident on the "Freedom's Path" set. He said that the gun was not supposed to be loaded with live ammunition, but that Halls had not checked it before handing it to an actor.

"The gun was not supposed to be loaded with live ammunition," Rodriguez said. "But Dave didn't check it before handing it to the actor. The actor pulled the trigger and the gun discharged, injuring a crew member."

Conclusion:

Dave Halls' history of neglecting safety measures on film sets has led to multiple injuries and ultimately to the tragic death of Halyna Hutchins. Despite being fired from previous productions for safety violations, Halls continued working in the industry, resulting in the fatal shooting on the set of "Rust."

This incident highlights the importance of strict safety protocols on film sets and the need for accountability for those who fail to uphold these standards.
