$1,400 Stimulus Checks: Over 165 Million Payments Delivered, IRS Prioritizes Tax Filers

New York, NY - Major banks in the United States commenced the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks in March, providing much-needed financial assistance to households grappling with the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has since delivered over 165 million payments totaling approximately $388 billion, with an official payment date of May 12 for the latest round.

"The stimulus checks have been a lifeline for many Americans during this challenging time," said Charlie Wise, head of global research and consulting at TransUnion. "They have helped people pay for essential expenses, such as rent, food, and utilities."

The IRS has prioritized individuals who filed their 2019 or 2020 tax returns and has vetted payment data for government benefit recipients, including Social Security beneficiaries. More than 460,000 "plus-up" payments were sent to individuals owed more than initially received, with another 500,000 payments to recent tax filers.

Approximately half of the new payments were sent via direct deposit and the other half through mail via checks or pre-paid debit cards. Lawmakers are considering a fourth round of payments as 38% of people report their household income remains impacted by the pandemic.

The IRS reopened the "Get My Payment" website for tracking the $1,400 checks, showing various statuses from processed payments to needing more information. Issues like unchanged addresses or bank information can affect payment delivery, but the IRS encourages filing 2020 tax returns with current information.

"It's important to make sure the IRS has your most up-to-date information," said Wise. "This will help ensure that you receive your payment as quickly as possible."

Pre-paid debit cards for stimulus payments will not be reloaded; a new card or alternative payment method will be issued. If the IRS has outdated bank account information, it may cause delays, but returned funds will lead to a mailed check or pre-paid debit card.

The IRS continues to process tax returns and issue payments on a weekly basis. Individuals who have not yet received their $1,400 stimulus check can check the status of their payment on the "Get My Payment" website or by calling the IRS at 1-800-919-9835.
