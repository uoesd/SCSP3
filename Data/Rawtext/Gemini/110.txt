Chris Cuomo Advises Brother to Resign Amid Sexual Harassment Scandal

New York, NY - Chris Cuomo, the CNN anchor and brother of former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, has revealed that he advised his sibling to resign following a damning report that found the governor had sexually harassed 11 women.

Chris Cuomo made the disclosure upon returning to his show, "Cuomo Primetime," after a vacation. He explained that he had not covered the scandal on CNN due to a conflict of interest but had offered his brother personal advice.

"I never covered it because I obviously have a conflict, and when my boss Jeff Zucker asked me if I could do it, I said, 'Of course not,'" Chris Cuomo said. "But I did advise my brother. I advised him to own what he did, take responsibility, be contrite, and to apologize to the people of the state of New York."

Chris Cuomo emphasized that he had never misled anyone on his show nor attempted to control CNN's coverage of his family. However, in May, he acknowledged discussing advisory strategies with his brother and his staff, a move he later apologized for after CNN expressed it was inappropriate.

"I never misled anyone on my show. I never attacked anyone who was attacking my brother. I never did anything to try to control CNN's coverage of my family," Chris Cuomo said. "I did advise my brother, and I did so as a brother. I never reported on the story because I couldn't. I never covered it because I shouldn't have."

Chris Cuomo's advice to his brother included owning his actions, being contrite, and realizing that perceptions of his actions matter more than intent.

"I told him, 'You have to own it. You have to apologize. You have to be contrite. You have to understand that the perception of what you did is more important than what you intended,'" Chris Cuomo said. "And I told him, 'You have to resign.'"

Governor Andrew Cuomo announced his resignation, to be effective in 14 days from his announcement, after the release of a damning report by the New York State Attorney General. The report found that the governor had sexually harassed 11 women, violating state and federal laws.

Chris Cuomo emphasized his commitment to doing the right thing and maintaining professional integrity despite the unique situation.

"I love my brother. I love my family. But I also love the truth. And I believe in integrity. And I believe in doing the right thing," Chris Cuomo said. "And I will always do that, no matter what."

The ongoing federal investigation into Andrew Cuomo's handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes and another by the Attorney General into misuse of state resources for his book remain active.
