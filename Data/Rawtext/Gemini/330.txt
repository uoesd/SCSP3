Suez Canal Blockage: Global Trade Disrupted, Nigeria Faces Higher Prices

The global economy has been dealt a significant blow with the blockage of the Suez Canal by the massive container ship 'The Ever Given' on March 25th, 2021. The incident has disrupted global trade, with far-reaching implications for countries around the world, including Nigeria.

The Suez Canal is a critical link for trade between Asia and Europe, with approximately 12% of global trade passing through the waterway. The blockage has caused a major disruption in the movement of goods, leading to delays and increased shipping costs.

The efforts to free the ship have been complex and time-consuming, involving the removal of 27,000 cubic meters of sand. The incident has exacerbated the global economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has already disrupted supply chains and slowed economic growth.

Nigeria, being heavily import-dependent, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of the Suez Canal blockage. The delays in shipping are likely to lead to increased prices for goods, as businesses pass on the higher costs to consumers.

"We anticipate that the blockage could take days or even weeks to clear, which will result in significant costs for companies and lead to higher freight costs," said Okojie Larry, Vice President and Head of Trade & Marine Operations at Gladius Commodities Limited.

Larry further predicted that the blockage could lead to price increases for various goods in Nigeria, including food, electronics, and machinery.

However, Opeoluwa Dapo-Thomas, a Private Oil Market Trader, believes that the impact on Nigeria will be negligible. "The main impact will be on ship owners and insurance companies, who will face increased costs," he said.

Despite the ship being partially refloated, normal traffic in the Suez Canal has yet to resume. This has affected the conveyance of crude oil, a major export for Nigeria. The delays could lead to potential demurrage and insurance claims, further impacting the country's economy.

Nigerian businesses are already incurring demurrages due to the blockage, which has implications for market liquidity. The delays in the movement of goods are also affecting production schedules and supply chains.

The Suez Canal blockage is a reminder of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the vulnerability of supply chains to disruptions. The incident highlights the need for businesses and governments to develop contingency plans to mitigate the impact of such events in the future.
