'Mare of Easttown': Evan Peters on the Emotional Impact of Detective Zabel's Death

Detective Colin Zabel's untimely demise in episode five of HBO's "Mare of Easttown" left viewers reeling. Actor Evan Peters and series director Craig Zobel meticulously crafted the character's departure to evoke a profound emotional response.

"We wanted to make sure that his death was really impactful," Zobel said. "We wanted to make sure that it was something that the audience would feel."

Peters, who portrayed Zabel, delved into the character's psyche, exploring new dimensions until his final day of shooting. "I was really trying to find the humanity in him," Peters said. "I wanted to make him as relatable as possible."

In an episode of the podcast "Still Watching: Mare of Easttown," Peters shared insights about Zabel's pivotal scene with Mare Sheehan (Kate Winslet). "That scene was really important to me," Peters said. "It was the first time that we really saw Zabel's vulnerability."

Series creator Brad Ingelsby initially envisioned Zabel as a confident, even cocky detective. "I thought he was going to be this hotshot detective from the city," Ingelsby said.

Costume designer Meghan Kasperlik's initial designs reflected this concept. "We wanted him to look like a city detective," Kasperlik said. "We gave him a tailored suit and a nice watch."

However, as the character developed, Zabel's portrayal shifted. "We realized that he was actually a young man who was struggling with imposter syndrome," Ingelsby said. "He was trying to prove himself, but he didn't really believe in himself."

Peters related more to this aspect of Zabel's character. "I've definitely felt imposter syndrome before," Peters said. "I think a lot of people can relate to that feeling."

To prepare for the role, Peters took pool lessons, although this skill ultimately played a minor role in Zabel's development. "I thought it would be a cool thing for him to do," Peters said. "But it ended up not being that important."

Despite his short-lived presence, Detective Colin Zabel left an indelible mark on "Mare of Easttown." His death served as a poignant reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of human connection.
