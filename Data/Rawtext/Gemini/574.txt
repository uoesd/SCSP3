Kabul Mosque Blast Kills Five, Wounds Four at Memorial Service

Kabul, Afghanistan - A deadly explosion outside the Eid Gah Mosque in Kabul on Wednesday killed at least five civilians and wounded four others, casting a shadow over a memorial service for the mother of Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.

The blast, the first major attack in Kabul since late August, targeted the gathering of mourners, underscoring the growing security challenges faced by the Taliban government.

"The explosion happened outside the Eid Gah Mosque during a memorial service for the mother of Zabihullah Mujahid," Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi told Al Jazeera English. "Five civilians were killed and four others were wounded."

The Italian-funded Emergency hospital in Kabul received four wounded individuals from the blast, according to Marco Puntin, the Country Director in Afghanistan for Emergency.

"We received four wounded patients from the explosion near the Eid Gah Mosque," Puntin said. "They are all civilians, and their injuries range from minor to severe."

Taliban fighters were not harmed in the attack, and three suspects have been arrested, according to Karimi.

"Our security forces have arrested three suspects in connection with the explosion," Karimi said. "We are investigating the incident and will provide more information as it becomes available."

The explosion is a stark reminder of the security challenges facing the Taliban, who have struggled to contain the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria-Khorasan Province (ISKP), an affiliate of the Islamic State group.

"This attack shows that the Taliban still faces significant security challenges," said Abdullah, a shopkeeper near the mosque. "People are worried about the security situation in Kabul and across the country."

ISKP has been increasing its attacks against the Taliban and expanding its presence closer to Kabul. The group has claimed responsibility for several recent attacks in the capital, including a suicide bombing at a mosque in September that killed at least eight people.

The attack on the Eid Gah Mosque is a setback for the Taliban, who have repeatedly claimed to have improved security in Afghanistan since taking power in August.

"This attack undermines the Taliban's claim of enhanced security in Afghanistan," said a Western diplomat in Kabul. "It shows that the Taliban still has a long way to go to stabilize the country."

The explosion also reflects the broader context of security and economic challenges facing Afghanistan under Taliban rule. The country is facing a severe humanitarian crisis, with millions of people facing hunger and poverty.

"The security situation in Afghanistan is very fragile," said a UN official in Kabul. "The Taliban needs to do more to address the security challenges and improve the lives of the Afghan people."

The attack on the Eid Gah Mosque is a reminder of the complex and dangerous situation in Afghanistan. The Taliban faces significant challenges in stabilizing the country and improving the lives of its people.
