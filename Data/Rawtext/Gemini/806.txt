Retail Sales Surge, Unemployment Falls Amid Stimulus-Fueled Spending

U.S. advance retail sales surged by an impressive 9.8% in March, significantly exceeding Dow Jones estimates of a 6.1% gain. This remarkable increase followed a 2.7% decline in February and marked the best month for retail since May 2020.

"The stimulus checks from the American Rescue Plan Act have clearly had a major impact on spending," said Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics. "We estimate that around two-thirds of the increase in retail sales in March can be attributed to the stimulus."

The spending boost was broad-based across sectors, with notable gains in sporting goods, clothing, and the bar and restaurant industry. However, despite the stimulus-fueled spending, a larger portion of the checks is being saved compared to the first round of stimulus.

"This suggests that households are still concerned about the economic outlook and are not spending all of their stimulus money," Pearce added.

Meanwhile, the labor market continues to show signs of improvement. First-time filings for unemployment insurance for the week ended April 10 fell to 576,000, the lowest since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate has also decreased from a pandemic peak of 14.7% to its current 6%.

In March, the economy added a significant 916,000 nonfarm payrolls, indicating a rebounding labor market. Consumption growth is also expected to continue rebounding rapidly in the second quarter. However, inflationary pressures are becoming evident, with a notable year-over-year consumer price index rise of 2.6% in March.
