Nadler's Claim Rittenhouse Crossed State Lines Armed is False

Fact Check:

Rep. Jerry Nadler's claim that Kyle Rittenhouse crossed state lines armed before the Kenosha shootings is false. Trial testimony and evidence presented during Rittenhouse's trial clearly show that the gun used in the shootings was stored in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and not transported across state lines.

Nadler's tweet, which stated "Rittenhouse traveled across state lines armed with an AR-15 to provoke a confrontation," was met with widespread criticism. Nadler's spokesperson, Dan Rubin, later clarified that the tweet was about Rittenhouse crossing state lines, not necessarily armed.

"The tweet was about the fact that Rittenhouse crossed state lines to go to Kenosha," Rubin said. "It was not about whether he was armed when he crossed state lines."

However, the evidence presented at trial contradicts Nadler's claim. Dominick Black, Rittenhouse's friend, testified that he purchased the AR-15 style gun for Rittenhouse in Wisconsin. Black also testified that the gun was kept in a safe at his home in Kenosha and was only accessed by Rittenhouse during the unrest.

Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges related to the shootings during the 2020 Kenosha unrest. The jury found that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense when he shot and killed two men and injured a third.

Rittenhouse did face a misdemeanor charge for gun possession as a minor, but that charge was later dismissed.

The misinformation in Nadler's tweet contributes to confusion surrounding the case's details. It is important to rely on accurate information and evidence when discussing this case.

Conclusion:

Based on the evidence presented at trial, Rep. Jerry Nadler's claim that Kyle Rittenhouse crossed state lines armed before the Kenosha shootings is false. The gun used in the shootings was stored in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and not transported across state lines.
