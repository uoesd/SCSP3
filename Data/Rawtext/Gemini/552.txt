Kabul Airport Attack Leaves East Bay Family Devastated

SAN LEANDRO, Calif. (KGO) – Qiamuddin Safi, an East Bay man who recently escaped Afghanistan, is grappling with the unimaginable loss of family members in the deadly Kabul airport attack.

Safi's cousin, a longtime interpreter for the U.S. Army, was killed in one of the blasts at Abbey Gate. His brother and another cousin are in the ICU, while two other cousins are hospitalized.

"My family was targeted because they worked for the U.S. government," Safi said. "They were victims of a terrorist attack."

Despite having Special Immigration Visas (SIV), Safi's family faced extreme danger. "They were supposed to be safe," he said. "But they weren't."

The attack has sent shockwaves through the Afghan community in the United States, adding to the heartache and fear they already endure.

"This is a tragedy that has affected our entire community," said Harris Mojadedi, with the Afghan Coalition. "We are devastated by the loss of life and the injuries sustained by our brothers and sisters."

Community leaders and organizations are rallying to support Afghan refugees and bring attention to human rights violations in Afghanistan.

"We are working tirelessly to help those who are still in danger," said Sara Fain, an attorney with the Immigration Institute of the Bay Area. "We need to ensure that they have a safe haven and that their voices are heard."

Safi's family's ordeal highlights the confusion and grief among those trying to help their families escape Afghanistan.

"I reached out to Bay Area lawmakers for help with my family's SIV application," Safi said. "But my pleas were not answered."

The tragic events amplify the need for a coordinated and compassionate response to the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan.

"We must not forget the sacrifices made by those who worked alongside our troops," Mojadedi said. "We owe it to them and their families to provide them with the support and protection they deserve."

Safi's cousin, killed in the attack, left behind two young children and was expecting another.

"He was a loving father and husband," Safi said. "He dedicated his life to helping others. He will be deeply missed."

The Kabul airport attack is a stark reminder of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. The Afghan community in the United States is calling for urgent action to protect those who remain in danger and to hold those responsible for the attack accountable.
