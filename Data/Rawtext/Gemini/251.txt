Biden Signs $1.9 Trillion Covid-19 Relief Package into Law

CNN – President Joe Biden signed a sweeping $1.9 trillion Covid-19 economic relief package into law on Thursday, marking a significant victory for his administration and a major step towards rebuilding the nation's economy.

"This historic legislation is about rebuilding the backbone of this country and giving the people of this nation, working people and middle-class folks, the tools, the support they need to recover," Biden said at a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.

The relief package, Biden's top legislative priority since taking office in January, was passed by Congress earlier this week. The signing was moved up a day earlier than planned, with a celebration with Congressional leaders to follow.

The plan includes $1,400 stimulus payments for most households, a $300 boost to weekly jobless benefits, and an expanded child tax credit. It also allocates $350 billion for state and local aid, funds for K-12 schools, small businesses, and Covid-19 vaccine distribution.

"This bill is a testament to the power of government to make a difference in the lives of the American people," said White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain. "It will provide much-needed relief to families, businesses, and communities across the country."

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced that stimulus checks could start appearing in bank accounts as early as the coming weekend.

"We are working around the clock to get this money into the pockets of the American people as quickly as possible," Psaki said.

Biden is scheduled to deliver his first prime-time address on Thursday evening, marking the one-year anniversary of the Covid-19 pandemic shutdown. In his address, Biden will acknowledge the pandemic's devastating impact and outline steps to combat the virus, offering a hopeful vision for the future.

The relief package provides $14 billion for Covid-19 vaccine research, distribution, and administration efforts. The Biden administration has set a goal of administering 100 million vaccine doses within his first 100 days in office.

"We are turning a corner in this pandemic," Biden said. "This legislation will help us accelerate the vaccination program, reopen schools, and get our economy back on track."

The relief package is expected to have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. Economists predict that it will boost GDP growth by 1.5% to 2% this year and create millions of jobs.

"This is a historic investment in the American people," Biden said. "It will help us build back better and emerge from this pandemic stronger than ever before."
