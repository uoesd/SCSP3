Gen. Powell Lauds Desert Storm Veterans: "They Made Us Proud"

Washington, D.C. - Retired General Colin Powell, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has heaped praise on the veterans of Operation Desert Storm, lauding their dedication, readiness, and unwavering commitment to their mission.

In a recent interview with Veterans Affairs (.gov), Powell recalled the remarkable spirit of the young service members he encountered during his visits downrange during Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

"They were so dedicated, so ready," Powell said. "They had a great sense of family, a great sense of mission. They made us proud."

Powell recounted heartwarming and humorous moments with the troops, highlighting their resilience and camaraderie. He recalled one instance where he asked a group of soldiers how they were doing.

"One of them said, 'Sir, we're doing great. We're just a little tired of eating MREs,'" Powell chuckled. "I said, 'Well, I'll see what I can do about that.' And I did."

Powell also emphasized the cautious approach taken by President George H.W. Bush, who sought a political solution before resorting to military action.

"President Bush was very reluctant to go to war," Powell said. "He wanted to give diplomacy a chance. But when diplomacy failed, he was determined to use military force to liberate Kuwait."

Powell's own doctrine, which advocated for war as a last resort and the strategic use of military force, played a pivotal role in shaping the conduct of the war.

"We wanted to use the minimum amount of force necessary to achieve our objectives," Powell said. "We didn't want to cause any more casualties than necessary."

The conflict began with a massive air campaign, which Powell described as "the most effective use of airpower in history." The air campaign softened the battlefield, paving the way for the ground war that followed.

"The ground war was a textbook example of how to conduct a military campaign," Powell said. "We had overwhelming superiority in firepower and mobility. We were able to defeat the Iraqi army in a matter of days."

Powell also highlighted the significant role played by advanced technology and media coverage during Desert Storm.

"This was the first war that was televised live," Powell said. "The American people were able to see the war as it was happening. This had a profound impact on public perception."

Powell concluded by acknowledging the crucial roles played by logisticians, Merchant Marines, and air transportation in the success of Desert Storm.

"These unsung heroes made it possible for us to project power into the Middle East and sustain our forces in the field," Powell said. "They deserve our eternal gratitude."

Powell's praise for the veterans of Desert Storm serves as a testament to their exceptional service and the enduring legacy of their sacrifice. Their dedication, readiness, and unwavering commitment to their mission continue to inspire generations of Americans.
