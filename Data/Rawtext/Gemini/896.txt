Brady's Super Bowl LII Scars Linger as Buccaneers Face Eagles

Philadelphia Eagles fans can take solace in the fact that even Tom Brady, the legendary quarterback who has shattered countless NFL records, still carries the scars of their team's triumph over his New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII.

"I still think about that game a lot," Brady admitted recently. "It was a tough one to lose, especially the way it ended."

Brady, now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, recently broke the NFL all-time passing yards record, previously held by Drew Brees. Yet, amidst the celebration, he couldn't resist a playful jab at his inability to catch a pass during the Super Bowl, referencing a dropped pass in a trick play.

"I guess I'm not the best receiver," Brady quipped.

The loss to the Eagles and its profound impact were chronicled in the Facebook documentary series 'Tom vs. Time'. Director Gotham Chopra said, "That game was a turning point for Tom. It showed him that he wasn't invincible."

Brady has openly discussed the mental scars from the Super Bowl loss, indicating he's not yet over it. "It's something that I'll always remember," he said. "It's a reminder that anything can happen in football."

The Buccaneers' recent victory over the Patriots drew about 27.2 million viewers, marking a high for Sunday Night Football since 2015. The game between Brady and his former coach, Bill Belichick, garnered significant attention and a 34% household share.

"It was a huge game for both teams," said NBC Sunday Night Football reporter Michelle Tafoya. "There was a lot of history and emotion involved."

Despite high viewer numbers, the game did not break into the top five regular-season broadcasts of all time. Jon Lewis, a writer for Sports Media Watch, attributed this to the fact that the game was played on a Sunday night, when viewership is typically lower than on other nights of the week.

In other NFL news, former tight end Greg Olsen and play-by-play announcer Joe Davis will call the upcoming Eagles vs. Panthers game. Olsen, who played for the Panthers from 2011 to 2019, is excited to return to Charlotte for the game.

"It's going to be a special night," Olsen said. "I have a lot of great memories from my time in Carolina."

Meanwhile, Eli Manning humorously interacted with fans on Twitter, regarding the absence of the Manning brothers' alternate Monday Night Football broadcast. When a fan asked if he was "taking a break," Manning replied, "I'm just trying to avoid getting tackled by Aaron Donald again."

As the NFL season continues, all eyes will be on Brady and the Buccaneers as they chase another Super Bowl title. But for Eagles fans, the memory of their victory over Brady and the Patriots in Super Bowl LII will always be a cherished one.
