Hopkins High School Teacher Suspended for Disturbing Comments on Oxford Shootings

An Allegan County teacher at Hopkins High School has been suspended after making disturbing comments about the Oxford High School shootings. The comments, made the day after the tragic incident, included detailed plans of how the teacher would have executed a similar act, involving physical violence and weapons.

Parents reported the teacher's comments as "violent, detailed," and "extremely scary," causing concern and fear among students and parents. Hopkins High School principal, Ken Szczepanski, stated that the school is investigating the comments made in multiple classroom periods.

"These comments were insensitive, especially given the timing following the Oxford tragedy," Szczepanski said. "We take these matters very seriously and are committed to providing a safe and supportive learning environment for our students."

Rumors circulated that an employee intended to "shoot up" the school, leading to increased anxiety within the school community. However, the superintendent assured that the situation was contained and the school was deemed safe for students.

A letter to parents explained that the rumors originated from the inappropriate classroom conversation led by the suspended teacher. One parent called for the teacher's permanent removal from the school, emphasizing a stance of "zero tolerance."

"We cannot tolerate any behavior that threatens the safety of our students," the parent said. "This teacher's comments were reckless and irresponsible, and they have no place in our school."

The school district is working with law enforcement to investigate the incident further. The suspended teacher has not been charged with any crime at this time.

The Oxford High School shooting, which occurred on November 30, 2021, resulted in the deaths of four students and the wounding of seven others. The incident has sparked national outrage and calls for stricter gun control measures.

The suspension of the Hopkins High School teacher serves as a reminder of the importance of creating a safe and supportive learning environment for all students. It also highlights the need for sensitivity and compassion in the wake of tragic events like the Oxford shooting.
