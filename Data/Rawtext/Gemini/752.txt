Firearms on Film: A Comprehensive Guide to Safety and Protocols

The tragic shooting on the set of the movie "Rust" has sent shockwaves through the film industry and beyond. The incident, which resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and the injury of director Joel Souza, has raised questions about the safety protocols surrounding the use of firearms on movie sets.

As a union armorer specializing in Westerns, I have witnessed firsthand the rigorous safety measures that are in place to prevent accidents with firearms on set. The "Rust" tragedy is an incredibly rare and unfortunate event that underscores the importance of adhering to these protocols.

The Process of Preparing and Using Firearms on Set

Most firearms used on film are real, requiring extensive paperwork, permits, and monitoring. Before any firearm can be brought onto a set, it must be inspected by the armorer, who is responsible for ensuring that it is in safe working order. The armorer also conducts safety briefings with the cast and crew, explaining the proper handling and use of firearms.

Revolvers and Blank Rounds

Revolvers are commonly used on film sets because they are easy to load and unload. Blank rounds, which are cartridges that contain gunpowder but no projectile, are used to simulate gunfire. When a blank round is fired, the gunpowder ignites, creating a loud noise and flash, but no bullet is discharged.

Safety protocols for using blank rounds include:

  • Ensuring that the gun is pointed in a safe direction at all times.
  • Never loading a blank round into a gun that is pointed at someone.
  • Checking the gun barrel for obstructions before firing.
  • Wearing protective gear, such as earplugs and eye protection.

Safety Measures on Set

In addition to the armorer, several other crew members are responsible for safety on set, including the property master, the assistant director, and the stunt coordinator. These individuals work together to ensure that all safety protocols are followed.

Safety measures on set include:

  • Actor training on the proper handling of firearms.
  • Rehearsals with "cold" guns (guns that are not loaded).
  • Checking for obstructions in the gun barrel before each take.
  • Using protective gear, such as earplugs and eye protection.

Live Rounds on Set

Live rounds are generally prohibited on set, with the exception of certain educational scenarios. When live firing is necessary, specific protocols are observed, including:

  • Checking if the chambers are empty before handing the gun to an actor.
  • Declaring the gun "hot" when it is loaded with live rounds.
  • Only firing the gun in a controlled environment with proper safety precautions in place.

Conclusion

The safety of cast and crew is paramount on movie sets. The "Rust" tragedy is a reminder that even with the most stringent safety protocols in place, accidents can still happen. It is essential that all individuals involved in the production of a film understand and adhere to these protocols to prevent future tragedies.

"Safety is our number one priority on set," says Joey Dillon, a union armorer and expert gun handler based in Los Angeles. "We take every precaution to ensure that firearms are handled safely and responsibly."
