Cuomo's Shadow Still Looms Over New York Politics

CNN – More than three months after his resignation due to sexual harassment allegations, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo remains a political presence, his future actions and influence a topic of speculation among New York politicians.

A state assembly report released in November found "overwhelming evidence" that Cuomo engaged in sexual harassment and was not transparent about COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. Cuomo has denied the sexual misconduct allegations and insisted that his book deal followed ethical norms.

Despite his political downfall, Cuomo's public communication is mostly through his lawyer, Rita Glavin, and spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, who defend him against the allegations.

"The attorney general's report was a political document, not a legal document," Glavin said. "It was full of speculation and innuendo, and it failed to meet the basic standards of due process."

Azzopardi echoed Glavin's sentiments, calling the report "a partisan hit job."

"The governor has always denied these allegations, and he will continue to fight to clear his name," Azzopardi said.

New Gov. Kathy Hochul is seen as bringing a more collaborative era to New York politics, but Cuomo's presence continues to loom over the state.

"Cuomo is still a very popular figure in New York, especially among Democrats," said Andrew Gounardes, a state senator from Brooklyn. "He has a lot of support, and he could still make a comeback."

Jay Jacobs, New York's state Democratic Party chairman, said that Cuomo's future is uncertain.

"I think it's too early to say what Cuomo's next move will be," Jacobs said. "He's still facing a number of legal challenges, and he needs to focus on clearing his name."

Chris Coffey, a New York political strategist, said that Cuomo could potentially run for state attorney general, a position he held from 2007 to 2010.

"Cuomo is a very ambitious politician, and he's not going to give up on his career," Coffey said. "He could see running for attorney general as a way to rebuild his reputation and get back into office."

However, Monica Klein, a progressive political consultant, said that Cuomo's political career is likely over.

"Cuomo has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, and he's facing a number of legal challenges," Klein said. "I think it's very unlikely that he'll be able to make a political comeback."

Cuomo's potential political comeback is fueled by rumors and media speculation, despite his current sidelined status. He and his team continue to challenge the findings of the investigation led by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

"The governor has always denied these allegations, and he will continue to fight to clear his name," Glavin said.

Azzopardi said that Cuomo is "focused on his family and his legal challenges."

"He's not thinking about politics right now," Azzopardi said.

Despite his denials, Cuomo's political future remains uncertain. He faces a number of legal challenges, and his reputation has been damaged by the sexual harassment allegations. However, he remains a popular figure among some New Yorkers, and he could potentially make a political comeback if he can clear his name.

Cuomo's Legal Challenges

Cuomo is facing a number of legal challenges, including a criminal investigation by the Albany County District Attorney's office. He is also facing a civil lawsuit filed by one of his accusers, Lindsey Boylan.

The Albany County District Attorney's office is investigating whether Cuomo committed any crimes related to the sexual harassment allegations. The investigation is ongoing, and no charges have been filed.

Boylan's lawsuit alleges that Cuomo sexually harassed her while she worked as an aide in his office. The lawsuit is ongoing, and Cuomo has denied the allegations.

Cuomo's Financial Resources

Cuomo's legal challenges are likely to be expensive. He has already spent millions of dollars on legal fees, and he is likely to spend more in the future.

There is some skepticism about the depth of Cuomo's financial resources. He has a net worth of about $10 million, but he is also facing a number of lawsuits, which could potentially cost him millions of dollars.

Cuomo's Political Future

Cuomo's political future is uncertain. He has denied the sexual harassment allegations, but he faces a number of legal challenges. His reputation has been damaged, but he remains a popular figure among some New Yorkers.

It is possible that Cuomo could make a political comeback if he can clear his name. However, it is also possible that his legal challenges will end his political career.
