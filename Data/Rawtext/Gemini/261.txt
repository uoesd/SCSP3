Pfizer and BioNTech Announce Positive Phase 2/3 Trial Results for COVID-19 Vaccine in Children Aged 5 to 11

NEW YORK AND MAINZ, Germany – Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE today announced positive Phase 2/3 trial results for their COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 5 to 11. The trial showed a favorable safety profile and robust antibody responses with a 10 μg dose regimen.

"These results provide further evidence of the safety and efficacy of our COVID-19 vaccine in children," said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pfizer. "With the rise in pediatric cases due to the Delta variant, it is critical that we extend vaccine protection to this younger population."

The trial involved 2,268 participants in the age group who received two doses of the 10 μg vaccine. Results showed strong immune responses in children, comparable to those in the 16 to 25 age group with the 30 μg dose.

"We are very pleased with the data from this trial, which are consistent with the results we have observed in older populations," said Dr. Ugur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of BioNTech. "These findings support our belief that our vaccine can provide safe and effective protection against COVID-19 in children."

Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit data for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States and update the EU Conditional Marketing Authorization. The study is part of a larger trial enrolling children aged 6 months to 11 years to evaluate the vaccine's safety and efficacy.

COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) by Pfizer and BioNTech is FDA-approved for individuals 16 and older and has EUA for those 12 and older, including a third dose for certain immunocompromised individuals.

Pfizer and BioNTech are committed to sharing further phase 3 trial data and aim for regulatory approvals for younger pediatric populations.
