Harry and Meghan Grace Time 100 Cover, Honored for Impactful Work

Sept 15 (Reuters) – Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been featured on the cover of Time magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. The couple joins a diverse group of honorees, including Billie Eilish, Britney Spears, and Simone Biles.

"The Time 100 list is a reflection of the leaders who are shaping our world, those who are driving positive change and creating a better future," said Edward Felsenthal, Time's editor in chief.

Harry and Meghan, who stepped down from their royal duties in 2020, have since pursued independent projects and charitable work. They have been recognized for their active compassion and refusal to remain silent on important issues.

"They don't just opine. They run towards the struggle," said Jose Andres, chef and founder of the World Kitchen nonprofit, in a tribute to the couple.

Britney Spears, who has been fighting against her conservatorship for years, is also included on the list. Paris Hilton, in a tribute to Spears, praised her resilience and spirit.

"She's been through so much, but she's still so joyful and full of life," Hilton said.

Billie Eilish, known for her unique style and self-advocacy, has been recognized for her influence on young people.

"She's not afraid to be herself, and she's always standing up for what she believes in," said Megan Thee Stallion.

The Time 100 list includes 54 women, a record for the magazine. Political figures such as President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump are also featured.

The honorees were selected by Time's editors based on their impact on the world, their innovation, and their ability to inspire others.

"These are the people who are shaping our world, for better or worse," Felsenthal said. "And we are proud to recognize their influence."
