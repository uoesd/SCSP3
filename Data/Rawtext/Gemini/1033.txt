Texas Winter Storm Death Toll May Be Five Times Higher Than Official Count

The devastating winter storm that swept through Texas in February caused widespread power outages and home damage, leading to a significant loss of life. While Texas officials have confirmed 151 deaths due to the storm, a data review by BuzzFeed suggests the actual number could be up to five times higher.

BuzzFeed's analysis used "excess fatalities" analysis, comparing deaths during the storm to those during normal conditions. The results indicated that between 426 and 978 more people died than expected during the storm week alone. The analysis estimated that 702 people could have died during the storm week alone.

Neighboring states with similar storm impact but without Texas's widespread power outages did not see a spike in deaths. This suggests that the power outages played a significant role in the high death toll in Texas.

Those who died were often medically vulnerable people with conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The storm left thousands without power, exacerbating conditions for residents who relied on electricity for medical equipment or heating.

In Harris County, at least 66 deaths were reported due to the storm. The county's medical examiner's office attributed most of the deaths to hypothermia or cardiac arrest.

Texas lawmakers are considering legislation aimed at preventing future blackouts, including Senate Bill 3. The bill would require power plants and natural gas facilities to winterize their equipment. However, there are concerns that the proposed legislation may not sufficiently ensure winterization of the state's natural gas infrastructure.

The winter storm exposed the vulnerability of Texas's energy grid and the need for better preparation for future extreme weather events. The true death toll from the storm remains uncertain, but the data suggests that it was significantly higher than the official count.
