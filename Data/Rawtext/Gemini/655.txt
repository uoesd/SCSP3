Rittenhouse Trial: Judge Rejects Evidence of Vigilantism, Criminal Background

Kenosha, Wis. - Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder has denied requests to introduce evidence aiming to show Kyle Rittenhouse's inclination for vigilantism and rejected a defense request to present evidence about one victim's criminal background.

Evidence of Vigilantism Denied

Prosecutors sought to introduce evidence of Rittenhouse's online posts and social media activity, arguing that they demonstrated his "propensity for violence" and desire to act as a vigilante. However, Judge Schroeder ruled that the evidence was irrelevant to the charges against Rittenhouse.

"The court finds that the prejudicial effect of this evidence outweighs its probative value," Judge Schroeder said.

Victim's Criminal Background Rejected

The defense requested to introduce evidence about the criminal background of Joseph Rosenbaum, one of the men Rittenhouse shot and killed. The defense argued that Rosenbaum's history of violence was relevant to Rittenhouse's self-defense claim.

Judge Schroeder denied the request, stating that the evidence was not relevant to the charges against Rittenhouse and that it could unfairly prejudice the jury.

Witness Addresses Required

Prosecutors have been ordered to provide addresses for about 27 potential witnesses. The defense had argued that the addresses were necessary to investigate the witnesses' backgrounds and potential biases.

Use-of-Force Experts

A separate pre-trial hearing will be held to discuss the admission of testimony from use-of-force experts. The defense has requested that experts be allowed to testify about Rittenhouse's actions and whether they were reasonable under the circumstances.

Trial Start Date

The trial is scheduled to start on November 1. Jury selection is expected to begin on October 25.

Infrared Video

Prosecutors revealed that they have infrared video from an FBI airplane that purportedly shows Rittenhouse chasing his first victim, Joseph Rosenbaum. The defense has not yet seen the video.

Jury Questionnaires

Judge Schroeder has yet to decide on whether potential jurors will be asked to fill out questionnaires before selection. The defense has requested questionnaires to help identify potential biases among jurors.

Judge Schroeder expressed concerns about the content of the questionnaires, stating that he did not want the trial to become "political."

"I don't want to get into a political debate about this case," Judge Schroeder said.

Incident of Rifle Expression

The judge withheld a final ruling on introducing an incident where Rittenhouse allegedly expressed a desire to use a rifle against perceived looters. The defense argued that the incident was relevant to Rittenhouse's state of mind at the time of the shootings.

Firearm Possession Charge

A motion to dismiss a misdemeanor charge of Rittenhouse possessing a firearm as a minor has yet to be ruled on. The defense argues that the charge is unconstitutional.
