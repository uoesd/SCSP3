Tiger Woods Returns to Competitive Golf at PNC Championship, Nine Months After Devastating Car Accident

Nine months after a severe car accident that left him with serious leg injuries, Tiger Woods is making a remarkable return to competitive golf at the PNC Championship, alongside his son, Charlie.

The accident, which occurred in February 2021, resulted in open fractures to Woods' tibia and fibula, along with ankle and soft tissue damage in his lower right leg. The injuries were so severe that Woods was largely bedridden for three months and began walking with crutches about two months post-accident.

Despite the challenges, Woods has persevered, focusing on chipping and putting practice and playing short-game competitions with his son. While he acknowledges that his leg and back will never be the same, affecting his ability to maintain a full golfing schedule and practice regimen, Woods remains determined to compete at the highest level.

"My leg is never going to be the same, and I'm going to have to manage that for the rest of my life," Woods said. "But I'm still able to play golf, and I'm still able to compete."

Woods has spent multiple days hitting full swing shots during the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas, and he plans to compete in a few events per year, akin to golfer Ben Hogan's career after recovering from an auto accident.

"I'm not going to play a full schedule ever again," Woods said. "I'm going to have to pick and choose what I play and be smart about it."

Woods understands the need to prove to himself in practice that he's good enough to compete at a high level.

"I'm not going to go out there unless I think I can win," Woods said. "I'm not going to go out there just to play."

Fellow golfer Justin Thomas believes Woods will only play if he can perform well.

"I think he's going to play if he feels like he can play at a high level," Thomas said. "I don't think he's going to play just to play."

Woods' return to competitive golf at the PNC Championship is seen as a significant step in his recovery and adaptation to his limitations.

"It's going to be a lot of fun," Woods said. "I'm looking forward to it."

Woods' return to golf is a testament to his resilience and determination. Despite facing significant challenges, he has remained focused on his recovery and has worked tirelessly to regain his competitive edge. His return to the PNC Championship is a major milestone in his journey, and it will be fascinating to see how he performs in the years to come.
