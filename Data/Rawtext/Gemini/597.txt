Harris: Truth-Telling, Unity Essential to Confronting Racism

Vice President Kamala Harris has underscored the significance of acknowledging the historical and ongoing impact of racism in America, emphasizing that truth-telling and accountability are crucial for fostering unity in the country.

In an interview with ABC News' "Good Morning America," Harris responded to GOP Sen. Tim Scott's assertion that America is not a racist country. While agreeing with Scott's sentiment, Harris stressed the need to confront the realities of racism's past and present.

"I think we have to acknowledge the history of racism in our country," Harris said. "We have to acknowledge the systemic racism that has existed and continues to exist."

Harris highlighted the importance of truth-telling in addressing racism, emphasizing that it is essential to recognize the experiences of marginalized communities. "We have to tell the truth about the history of racism in our country," she said. "We have to tell the truth about the impact of racism on our communities."

The Vice President also praised President Joe Biden for labeling white supremacy as terrorism and the most lethal threat to the United States. "I think it's important that we call it what it is," Harris said. "White supremacy is a threat to our national security."

Harris discussed the Biden administration's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, emphasizing the need for bipartisan cooperation. "We want to work with Republicans and Democrats to get this done," she said. However, she did not specify how much the administration is willing to compromise on the plan.

President Biden has assigned Harris the task of leading the effort to expand broadband internet access. Harris clarified her role in the infrastructure proposal, stating that it is specific to broadband expansion, not the entire initiative.

"My focus is on broadband," Harris said. "I'm focused on making sure that we have broadband access in every community in America."

Vice President Harris is also tasked with leading the diplomatic effort to address migration from Central America. She emphasized the importance of long-term investment and cooperation with world leaders to address the root causes of migration from the region.

"We have to address the root causes of migration," Harris said. "We have to invest in these countries so that people don't feel like they have to leave their homes."
