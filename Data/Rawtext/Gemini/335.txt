Ever Given Mod Brings Suez Canal Chaos to Microsoft Flight Simulator

The Ever Given, the colossal container ship that famously blocked the Suez Canal in March, has found a new home in Microsoft Flight Simulator thanks to the ingenuity of modders. The mod, created by FlyBoyRez1 and inspired by Zepingouin35, recreates the Suez Canal traffic jam in meticulous detail.

The mod features the Ever Given itself, surrounded by a sea of other ships that were forced to wait for the canal to be reopened. Parked boats in the Suez Gulf and the attempts by tugboats to free the ship are also included, adding to the realism of the simulation.

One of the most amusing features of the mod is the inclusion of a pair of excavators, recreating the popular digger meme that emerged during the real-life incident. These excavators can be seen attempting to dig the Ever Given out of the canal, providing a humorous touch to the otherwise serious event.

YouTube content creator Bill4LE attempted to land a plane on the modded ship but failed, showcasing the challenges of navigating the congested waterway. The mod is available for download at Flight Sim.io, with additional required mods mentioned in the description.

The Ever Given mod has also been spotted in other video games, including Rust and Valheim, demonstrating the cultural impact of the Suez Canal incident. Reddit users have shared screenshots of the ship in these games, adding to the widespread fascination with the event.

The Microsoft Flight Simulator mod is a testament to the creativity and humor of the modding community. It transforms a real-world event into a virtual experience, allowing players to witness the Suez Canal chaos from a unique perspective. The mod serves as a cultural nod to the incident, mixing humor and simulation to create a memorable gaming experience.
