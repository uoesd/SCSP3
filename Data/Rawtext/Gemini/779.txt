'Rust' Armorer Under Fire for Alleged Gun Safety Violations

The head armorer of the film "Rust," Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, has come under scrutiny for her alleged carelessness with guns on set, including an incident where she reportedly gave an improperly checked gun to an 11-year-old actress on a previous film set.

The New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Bureau (OHSB) is currently investigating the shooting accident on "Rust" that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. According to two production sources, Gutierrez-Reed handed a loaded weapon to a child without checking for barrel obstructions. Crew members had to intervene and filming was paused until the firearm was properly checked.

Gutierrez-Reed had previously expressed concerns over her experience level for the role. This was her second film as a head gun handler, with "Rust" being the project where Alec Baldwin fatally shot Hutchins.

Prior to the fatal shooting on "Rust," crew members raised safety concerns due to previous accidental prop gun discharges. The shooting incident resulted in the death of Hutchins and injury of director Joel Souza.

The OHSB investigation could result in civil penalties.

Alleged Incident on Previous Film Set

The alleged incident involving Gutierrez-Reed and the 11-year-old actress occurred on the set of the film "The Old Way." According to production sources, Gutierrez-Reed handed the child a gun without checking it for barrel obstructions. The child was supposed to point the gun at the camera, but the gun was loaded with live ammunition.

Crew members intervened and stopped the child from pointing the gun at the camera. The incident was reported to the producers, who then fired Gutierrez-Reed.

Concerns Raised Prior to Fatal Shooting

Prior to the fatal shooting on "Rust," crew members raised safety concerns with the production team. According to a report by The Wrap, crew members complained about accidental prop gun discharges and a lack of safety protocols on set.

One crew member reported that a gun had been accidentally fired twice during a rehearsal. Another crew member reported that a gun had been left unattended on a table.

Investigation and Potential Penalties

The OHSB is currently investigating the shooting accident on "Rust." The investigation could result in civil penalties against the production company or individuals involved in the incident.

The OHSB has the authority to impose fines of up to $13,653 per violation. The bureau can also issue citations and orders to correct safety hazards.

Conclusion

The allegations against Gutierrez-Reed raise serious questions about the safety protocols on the set of "Rust." The OHSB investigation will determine whether any violations occurred and if so, what penalties will be imposed.

The fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins has highlighted the importance of gun safety on film sets. The industry must take steps to ensure that such tragedies do not happen again.
