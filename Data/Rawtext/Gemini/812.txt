Child Tax Credit Payments to Reach Families in August

BALTIMORE (WBFF/WKRC) – The expanded federal Child Tax Credit will distribute about $15 billion in payments to families in August, aiding roughly 61 million children.

The payments are part of the 'American Rescue Plan' initiated in March. The next payment is scheduled for direct deposit on August 15, with mailed checks arriving a few days later. This September 15th payment will be the 3rd in a series of 6 monthly payments planned for this year.

The first half of the credit is being distributed through monthly checks, with the remainder to be received during tax filing in 2022. Eligible families must have at least one child under 18; $300 per child under 6 and $250 per child between 6 and 17 are the payment amounts.

Eligibility for the full Child Tax Credit begins to phase out for incomes exceeding $150,000 for joint filers, $112,500 for heads of households, and $75,000 for single filers. A phaseout reduces the Child Tax Credit by $50 for each $1,000 above the income threshold.

An error in July's direct deposit affected 15% of recipients, which is expected to be resolved for this month's payment. The IRS will send a letter at the year's end to families who received checks, which is necessary for tax filing in 2022.

The expanded Child Tax Credit is intended to provide financial relief to families with children during the ongoing pandemic. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the credit is estimated to reduce child poverty by 40%.

Families who have not yet received their payments can check the IRS website or call the IRS at 1-800-908-4184.
