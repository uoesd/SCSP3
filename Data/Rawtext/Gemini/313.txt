Ever Given Impoundment Leaves Millions in Goods Stranded

London CNN Business – The Ever Given, the massive container ship that blocked the Suez Canal for six days in March, remains impounded in Egypt, holding millions of dollars worth of goods for companies like IKEA and Lenovo.

The ship's seizure has sparked a protracted legal battle between the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) and the vessel's Japanese owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha. The SCA is seeking $916 million in compensation for damages and lost revenue caused by the blockage.

As a result, the goods on board the Ever Given, estimated to be worth between $600 million and $700 million, are stuck in limbo. This has left affected companies, both large and small, facing significant financial and legal challenges.

"We have a container on the Ever Given with around £200,000 worth of goods," said Will Pearson, Director of Pearson 1860, a UK bicycle maker. "We're very concerned about the potential financial impact this could have on our business."

Jai Sharma, Head of Cargo Casualty at Clyde & Co., explained that companies may be liable for a portion of the settlement under the "general average" maritime law principle. This principle requires all parties who benefit from a salvage operation to contribute to the costs.

"In this case, the salvage operation was the freeing of the Ever Given from the Suez Canal," Sharma said. "So, all the cargo owners on board the ship may be required to contribute to the settlement."

Shoei Kisen Kaisha and the SCA have not commented on the situation. However, several companies have expressed frustration over being excluded from negotiations and left in the dark about the status of their goods.

"We've been given no information about what's happening," said Michael Shah, CEO of EasyEquipment, a commercial refrigerator supplier. "We don't know when we'll get our goods back or how much it's going to cost us."

Jack Griffiths, Co-founder of Snuggy UK, a company that sells weighted blankets, said the situation has caused major cash flow issues for his business. "We have £100,000 worth of blankets on that ship," Griffiths said. "We don't have marine insurance, so this could be a huge financial blow."

IKEA and Lenovo confirmed that they have products on the impounded ship but declined to provide specifics.

The legal battle over the Ever Given is expected to be complex and protracted. Companies affected by the impounded goods may face significant financial losses and legal expenses. The situation highlights the risks and uncertainties associated with global shipping and the importance of marine insurance for businesses.
