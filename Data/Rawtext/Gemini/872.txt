Tiger Woods Survives Horrific Car Crash, Undergoes Surgery

Golf legend Tiger Woods miraculously survived a severe car crash in Los Angeles on Tuesday, leaving him with serious leg injuries.

The single-vehicle accident occurred around 7:12 a.m. when Woods' SUV struck a median and rolled approximately 100 feet off the road. Deputy Carlos Gonzalez of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported that Woods was "calm, lucid, and wearing his seatbelt" at the scene.

"He was very fortunate to come out of this alive," said Gonzalez.

Woods was transported to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he underwent surgery for multiple leg injuries. Sheriff Alex Villanueva stated that there was no evidence of impairment at the crash scene.

"There was no attempt to draw blood at the hospital to test for impairment," Villanueva said. "That's not to say that he wasn't impaired. That's just to say that we don't have any evidence that he was."

An investigation into the crash's causes is underway, with findings expected to be released in the coming days or weeks. A minor second crash occurred when another driver stopped to help Woods, but no one was injured.

Sporting figures and former President Donald Trump have expressed their support for Woods on social media.

"Praying for my friend @TigerWoods who was in a car accident this morning," tweeted basketball legend Michael Jordan. "Get well soon, Tiger."

"Thoughts and prayers to @TigerWoods and his family," wrote Trump. "Get well soon, Tiger!"

Woods' survival is attributed to his use of a seatbelt during the incident. The PGA legend has a long history of back injuries, but his current condition is expected to impact his golf career.
