Navy Corpsman Killed in Kabul Attack Posthumously Promoted

WASHINGTON – Navy Hospital Corpsman Maxton W. Soviak, who was killed in an Islamic State attack at Kabul airport during the U.S. evacuation mission, has been posthumously promoted to petty officer 3rd class.

Soviak was one of 13 U.S. service members killed in the Aug. 26, 2021, attack. He was assigned to the 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, Camp Pendleton, Calif.

In addition to his promotion, Soviak was also awarded the Purple Heart and Fleet Marine Force Corpsman warfare badge.

"Hospital Corpsman Maxton Soviak's dedication and service to our nation will never be forgotten," said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro. "His sacrifice will forever be remembered as a testament to the bravery and selflessness of our service members."

The attack occurred during the final days of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, as U.S. and coalition forces evacuated over 124,000 people from the country.

Soviak's remains were transferred to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Tuesday and are scheduled to arrive at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on Wednesday. A public procession for Soviak is planned to follow the arrival of his remains.

"Maxton was a true hero," said his father, Kevin Soviak. "He loved his country and he loved serving his fellow Marines. We are so proud of him and we will never forget his sacrifice."

Soviak's death is a reminder of the dangers that U.S. service members faced during the evacuation mission in Afghanistan. His sacrifice will not be forgotten.
