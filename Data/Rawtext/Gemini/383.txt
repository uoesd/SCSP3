Facebook Outage Costs Company $60 Million in Lost Revenue

Facebook experienced a massive outage on Monday, October 4, 2021, that lasted for several hours and affected millions of users worldwide. The outage, which began around 8:30 a.m. PT/11:30 a.m. ET, disrupted access to Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.

The outage has reportedly cost Facebook at least $60 million in lost revenue. This estimate was calculated by Fortune and Snopes based on Facebook's second-quarter earnings report, which showed that the company generates approximately $319.6 million in revenue per day.

The financial impact of the outage is significant given Facebook's reliance on its ad business. The company generates the vast majority of its revenue from advertising, and the outage prevented businesses from reaching their target audiences on Facebook's platforms.

Facebook acknowledged the outage in a statement, saying that its teams were working to restore services. The company did not provide a specific reason for the outage but said that it was not the result of a cyberattack.

Services began to come back online by approximately 3:30 p.m. PT/6:30 p.m. ET on the same day. Facebook apologized for the inconvenience and expressed gratitude for users' patience.

The outage also had a negative impact on Facebook's stock price. Shares of Facebook dropped nearly 5% in after-hours trading, reducing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's net worth and ranking. The outage also led to a broader selloff in social media stocks, affecting shares of Twitter and Snap.

The outage is a reminder of the importance of social media platforms in our daily lives. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger are used by billions of people around the world to stay connected with friends and family, share news and information, and conduct business. The outage disrupted these activities and highlighted the potential financial impact of such disruptions.
