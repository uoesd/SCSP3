Trash Pickup Lags in New Orleans, Frustrating Residents

Sept. 16, 2021 – Nearly three weeks after Hurricane Ida ravaged New Orleans, trash pickup remains a major problem, with some areas of the city still not serviced since the storm.

Labor issues and a national labor shortage have been cited as reasons for the slow collection process. Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced on Wednesday that residents could dispose of trash at Elysian Fields Transfer Station starting from Sept. 16, 2021.

"We are working diligently to address the trash pickup issue," Cantrell said. "We have brought in additional resources and are working with our contractors to increase the frequency of collections."

Metro Service Group, the city's trash collection agency, had been lagging in collections even before Hurricane Ida. Workers for the agency went on strike in May 2020, demanding higher wages and COVID-19 protection equipment.

"The city has been struggling with trash collection for a long time," said Ryan Nelsen, who lives in the Lower Ninth Ward. "The strike last year was a wake-up call, but it seems like the city still hasn't gotten its act together."

To address staffing challenges, the city has contracted additional waste companies and extended existing contracts to find more bidders. However, the process has been slow, and residents are growing increasingly frustrated.

"I've been putting my trash out every week, but it's not getting picked up," said Jesse Webber, a resident of Algiers. "It's starting to pile up, and it's becoming a health hazard."

The labor dispute from the previous year is still fresh in the minds of many residents, highlighting ongoing issues with fair compensation for trash collectors. A "Trash Parade" protest has been scheduled for Saturday, Sept. 18, to demand better working conditions and pay for sanitation workers.

City Council members are also seeking solutions. A joint Public Works and Budget Committees meeting has been scheduled for next week to discuss the trash collection issue.

"We need to find a long-term solution to this problem," said Councilmember Helena Moreno. "Our residents deserve to have their trash picked up on a regular basis."

Mayor Cantrell's pre-Ida claim of emergency preparedness has come under scrutiny amid the current trash collection delays. Critics argue that the city was not adequately prepared for the storm and that the trash collection issues are a symptom of a larger problem.

"The mayor said we were ready for anything," said Councilmember Jay Banks. "But clearly, we weren't."

The city is urging residents to be patient as they work to address the trash collection issue. However, it is unclear how long it will take for the situation to improve.

In the meantime, residents are taking personal steps to manage and dispose of their trash. Some are burning their trash, while others are paying private companies to haul it away.

"I'm not going to wait for the city to come pick up my trash," said Nelsen. "I'm going to take care of it myself."

The trash collection issue is a major inconvenience for residents of New Orleans. It is also a reminder of the city's ongoing challenges with labor relations and emergency preparedness.
