Grand Jury Weighs Federal Charges Against Ex-Cop in Floyd's Death

WASHINGTON (AP) – A federal grand jury is considering charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the death of George Floyd, whose killing last year sparked nationwide protests and a reckoning on race in the United States.

Chauvin is already facing state murder and manslaughter charges in Floyd's death, with his trial set to begin on March 8. The federal investigation, however, focuses specifically on Chauvin and involves other officers as witnesses.

Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for several minutes. Floyd's death led to widespread outrage and protests across the country, reigniting a national debate on police brutality and racial injustice.

Three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest are charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin and will face trial in August.

The federal grand jury's activity comes as the Justice Department under President Joe Biden is expected to place a greater emphasis on civil rights and policing policies. Judge Merrick Garland, Biden's nominee for attorney general, pledged during his confirmation hearing to combat racial discrimination in policing.

Former Attorney General William Barr, under the Trump administration, blocked a potential plea deal involving Chauvin last year. The increased grand jury activity may be part of a broader Justice Department strategy under the new administration.

The federal charges against Chauvin could include civil rights violations, which carry potential life sentences. The Justice Department has also opened a broader investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department's practices.

The grand jury's deliberations are ongoing, and it is unclear when or if charges will be filed. However, the federal investigation and potential charges represent a significant development in the case that has drawn national attention.

The Justice Department's increased focus on civil rights and policing policies is seen as a shift from the Trump administration, which had rolled back some Obama-era reforms aimed at addressing racial disparities in the criminal justice system.

The Biden administration has pledged to prioritize civil rights and address systemic racism in policing and other areas. The Justice Department's actions in the Floyd case and its broader investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department are seen as a test of that commitment.
