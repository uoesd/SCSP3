Tragedy in Kabul: 13 US Service Members Killed in Terrorist Attack

Kabul, Afghanistan - In a devastating turn of events, 13 US service members were killed and at least 18 others were wounded in a terrorist attack at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Thursday, August 26, 2021.

The attack, which occurred as the US and its allies continue their withdrawal from Afghanistan, has been claimed by the Islamic State (ISIS-K). The Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, confirmed the casualties, stating, "We can confirm that the explosion at the Abbey Gate was the result of a complex attack that resulted in a number of US and civilian casualties."

CENTCOM spokesman Capt. Bill Urban provided further details, saying, "We can confirm that a number of US service members were killed in today's complex attack at the Abbey Gate. We are still assessing the total number of casualties."

This marks the first US military combat deaths in Afghanistan since February 2020. The attack also resulted in the deaths of at least 95 Afghans and injuries to an additional 120 to 140, according to Afghan health officials.

Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, head of US Central Command, confirmed that ISIS-K was responsible for the attack. "We can also confirm that the attack on the Abbey Gate was planned and executed by ISIS-K," he said.

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin expressed deep condolences to the families of the fallen service members. "On behalf of the Department of Defense, I extend my deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the service members who were killed in today's attack in Kabul," he said. "We are also thinking of those who were injured and their families."

Austin emphasized that the mission in Afghanistan would continue despite the attack. "We will not be deterred by terrorists. We will continue to evacuate American citizens, Afghan partners, and vulnerable Afghans," he said.

President Joe Biden also addressed the nation, highlighting the ongoing threat from ISIS-K to US and allied forces, as well as to civilians. "This is a tough day. It's a tough day for our troops and their families. It's a tough day for the families of those who were killed," he said. "We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt down the terrorists who are responsible for this attack and make them pay."

The attack has drawn criticism from some quarters, with some questioning the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. However, Secretary Austin pledged support for the families of fallen service members and affirmed the mission's importance. "We will continue to do everything we can to support the families of our fallen service members and to ensure that their sacrifice is not in vain," he said. "We will continue to work to evacuate American citizens, Afghan partners, and vulnerable Afghans. And we will continue to support the Afghan people as they build a more stable and secure future."

The attack has cast a shadow over the ongoing withdrawal from Afghanistan, which is scheduled to be completed by August 31. The US and its allies are now facing a difficult task of balancing the need to evacuate their citizens and Afghan partners with the security challenges posed by the Taliban and ISIS-K.
