Brady Sails into Luxury with $6 Million Yacht Purchase

Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady has added a luxurious vessel to his fleet, purchasing a $6 million Wajer 77 yacht following his Super Bowl victory in February.

Brady's newfound affinity for yachting emerged after his move from the New England Patriots to Tampa Bay, a city he described as a "boating community." He previously owned a $2 million Wajer 55S yacht, which he proudly displayed during the Bucs' boat parade after their Super Bowl triumph.

The Wajer 77 represents a significant upgrade, offering ample space for family vacations and extended trips to destinations like the Caribbean. "The Wajer 77 is a great boat for day and weekend trips, especially for our family trips to the Bahamas," Brady said.

Despite the hefty price tag, the yacht purchase does not put a dent in Brady's finances. In 2020 alone, he earned $25 million from his base salary, not including substantial endorsement income.

"I'm very fortunate to be in a position where I can afford to buy a yacht," Brady acknowledged. "It's something that I've always wanted to do, and I'm excited to be able to share it with my family."

Meanwhile, fans of Brady's legendary career have an opportunity to own a piece of football history. The football from Brady's first pass in the NFL is currently being auctioned off by Lelands.

"This is a very rare and unique item," said Jordan Gilroy, director of acquisitions at Lelands. "It's the first pass of Tom Brady's career, and it's a piece of football history that could potentially increase in value over time."

Gilroy noted that the football could end up in a private collection, making this auction its last public offering. "It's a great opportunity for fans to own a piece of Tom Brady's legacy," he added.

Brady's yacht purchase and the auction of his first NFL pass highlight the quarterback's continued success both on and off the field. As he enters his 23rd NFL season, Brady remains a dominant force in the league and an inspiration to fans worldwide.
