'SNL' Returns with Fauci, Cuomo Brothers, and Cruz in COVID-19 Skit

Saturday Night Live (SNL) kicked off Season 47 with a hilarious sketch featuring Kate McKinnon as Dr. Anthony Fauci, addressing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

McKinnon's Fauci took on the omicron variant, urging viewers to "get boosted, get tested, and wear a mask." She also tackled questions on vaccine cards, emphasizing the importance of keeping them safe.

"If you lose your vaccine card, it's like losing your passport," McKinnon said. "You're not going anywhere."

The skit also featured Pete Davidson and Andrew Dismukes as disgraced brothers Andrew and Chris Cuomo. Andrew Cuomo resigned as New York Governor following sexual harassment accusations, while Chris Cuomo was fired from CNN for aiding his brother against the allegations.

"We lost our jobs because of COVID," Davidson's Andrew Cuomo joked. "It's the only thing we've ever agreed on."

The skit humorously suggested that family was more important than politics, with Dismukes' Chris Cuomo saying, "We're brothers, and we'll always be there for each other, even if we're both out of a job."

Aidy Bryant made a cameo as U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, who humorously mentioned preferring to spend holidays in Cancun alone. Cruz was criticized for traveling to Mexico during a winter storm in Texas.

The episode also commented on Chris Cuomo's pulled book publication and accusations of sexual harassment. "My book was supposed to come out this week," Dismukes' Chris Cuomo said. "But it's been postponed indefinitely, which is a nice way of saying it's never coming out."

The skit implies that SNL has taken a lighter and funnier approach due to the absence of a presidential election. "It's nice to have a break from politics," McKinnon's Fauci said. "We can just focus on the science."

"And the Cuomo brothers," Davidson added. "They're like a Greek tragedy, but with more hair gel."
