Chauvin Faces Up to 30 Years for Floyd's Murder

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, faces up to 30 years in prison when he is sentenced on June 25.

Chauvin was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. Under Minnesota law, he will only be sentenced for the most serious charge, second-degree murder, which has a maximum sentence of 40 years.

Experts predict Chauvin is unlikely to receive the maximum sentence. "The realistic expectation is a maximum of 30 years," said Mark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law.

Minnesota's sentencing guidelines suggest a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years for someone with no criminal record, like Chauvin. However, prosecutors are seeking an "upward departure" from the guidelines, citing aggravating factors such as Floyd's vulnerability and the presence of children during the crime.

"We believe the facts of this case are so egregious that they warrant an upward departure," said Attorney General Keith Ellison.

The expectation is based on precedent that an upward departure sentence should not exceed double the guideline range. "The most that the judge could give him is 25 years," said Ted Sampsell-Jones, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law.

Chauvin can expect to serve two-thirds of his sentence in prison with good behavior, the rest potentially on supervised release.

Both the defense and prosecution will submit briefs on aggravating factors, which will influence Judge Peter Cahill's sentencing decision. A pre-sentence investigation report, typically including personal history and the offense's impact, will also be considered in the sentencing.

It's uncertain if Chauvin will speak at his sentencing hearing. "If he does speak, it's likely to be brief and focused on expressing remorse," said Mary Moriarty, a former Hennepin County chief public defender. "But he may also choose to remain silent to avoid potentially damaging his chances on appeal."

Aggravating Factors

Prosecutors have identified several aggravating factors that they believe warrant an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines. These include:

  • Floyd's particular vulnerability due to his physical and mental health conditions.
  • The presence of children during the crime, who witnessed the traumatic event.
  • Chauvin's abuse of his position of authority as a police officer.
  • Chauvin's lack of remorse or empathy for Floyd's suffering.

Mitigating Factors

The defense is expected to argue that there are mitigating factors that should be considered in Chauvin's sentencing. These may include:

  • Chauvin's lack of prior criminal record.
  • His military service and his work as a police officer for nearly two decades.
  • His good behavior while in custody.

Sentencing Range

Based on the aggravating and mitigating factors, experts predict that Chauvin's sentence will likely fall within the following range:

  • Presumptive sentence under the guidelines: 12 1/2 years
  • Upward departure sentence: 15-25 years
  • Maximum possible sentence: 30 years

Appeal

Chauvin's attorneys have already filed an appeal of his conviction. If he is sentenced to a significant prison term, he is likely to continue to pursue his appeal.

The sentencing of Derek Chauvin is a highly anticipated event that will have a profound impact on the families of George Floyd and Derek Chauvin, as well as on the community and the nation as a whole.
