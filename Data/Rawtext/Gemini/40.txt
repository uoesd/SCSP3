Supreme Court Revisits LGBTQ Rights in 303 Creative Case

Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Supreme Court is once again delving into the contentious issue of LGBTQ rights, this time in the case of 303 Creative v. Elenis. At the heart of the case is Lorie Smith, a website designer in Colorado who seeks to refuse service to LGBTQ customers for same-sex weddings, invoking First Amendment protections.

The Case at Hand

Smith's website design business, 303 Creative, caters to weddings and other special events. However, she objects to creating websites for same-sex weddings on religious grounds. In 2016, Colorado's Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA) was amended to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes, effectively prohibiting businesses from denying services based on these characteristics.

Smith preemptively filed a lawsuit in federal court, arguing that CADA violates her First Amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of religion. The lower courts ruled against her, holding that the state's interest in preventing discrimination outweighed her religious objections.

Lambda Legal's Concerns

Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ legal advocacy organization, is deeply concerned about the potential implications of a ruling in favor of 303 Creative. "If the Supreme Court rules in favor of 303 Creative, it would open the door to widespread discrimination against LGBTQ people under the guise of free speech," said Jennifer Pizer, Acting Chief Legal Officer of Lambda Legal.

Echoes of Past Cases

The 303 Creative case bears similarities to previous Supreme Court cases involving service denial on religious grounds. In Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission (2018), the Court ruled in favor of a baker who refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. However, in that case, the baker had already refused service, while in 303 Creative, Smith is seeking the right to deny services preemptively.

Another relevant case is Fulton v. City of Philadelphia (2021), where the Court ruled in favor of Catholic foster care agencies that refused to work with same-sex couples. In that case, the Court focused on the government's failure to demonstrate a compelling interest in overriding the agencies' religious beliefs.

Focus on Free Speech

In 303 Creative, the Supreme Court has declined to take up the freedom of religion aspect or to reconsider the Smith v. Employment Division precedent, which limits the ability of individuals to assert religious objections to generally applicable laws. Instead, the Court will focus on the free speech argument.

Alliance Defending Freedom's Position

Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a conservative legal organization, represents 303 Creative. ADF argues that forcing Smith to serve same-sex weddings violates her First Amendment right to free speech. "The government cannot compel an artist to create a message that violates their conscience," said Kristen Waggoner, President of ADF.

Critics' Warnings

Critics, including Pizer, warn that a ruling in favor of 303 Creative could legitimize discrimination against LGBTQ individuals. "This case is not about a website designer's right to express her views," said Pizer. "It's about her right to discriminate against LGBTQ people."

Friend-of-the-Court Brief

A friend-of-the-court brief filed by Dale Carpenter, a law professor at Southern Methodist University, and Eugene Volokh, a First Amendment legal scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles, supports 303 Creative's First Amendment claims. Carpenter and Volokh argue that expressive goods and services, such as website design, are entitled to First Amendment protection.

U.S. Solicitor General's Involvement

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to let the U.S. solicitor general present arguments on behalf of the Biden administration in this case. The solicitor general's office will likely argue that CADA is a valid exercise of the state's authority to prevent discrimination and that Smith's First Amendment rights are not violated.

Potential Impact

The outcome of 303 Creative v. Elenis could have significant implications for LGBTQ rights and the balance between free speech and anti-discrimination laws. A ruling in favor of 303 Creative could embolden businesses to refuse service to LGBTQ individuals based on religious or other objections. Conversely, a ruling against 303 Creative would reinforce the principle that businesses cannot discriminate against LGBTQ people under the guise of free speech.

The Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments in 303 Creative v. Elenis in the fall of 2023. A decision is likely to be issued by the end of June 2024.
