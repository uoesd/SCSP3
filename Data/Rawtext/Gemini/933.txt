House Impeaches Trump Again, Making History with Bipartisan Support

CNN – The House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time on Wednesday, making it the most bipartisan impeachment in history with 10 Republican representatives voting for it.

The vote was 232-197, with all Democrats and 10 Republicans voting in favor of impeachment. The 10 Republicans who voted for impeachment were: Liz Cheney (WY), Adam Kinzinger (IL), John Katko (NY), Tom Rice (SC), Fred Upton (MI), Jaime Herrera Beutler (WA), Dan Newhouse (WA), Peter Meijer (MI), Anthony Gonzalez (OH), and David Valadao (CA).

This event is historic due to the high level of polarization in American politics and the usual party-line nature of past impeachments. In the previous three impeachments (Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Trump's first impeachment), there was almost no cross-party support.

The fact that 10 Republicans voted for impeachment this time around is a sign of the deep divisions within the Republican Party over Trump. Trump's job approval rating among Republicans has recently dropped, but it remains above 70%.

It is worth noting that two of the Republicans who voted for impeachment, Herrera Beutler and Newhouse, come from Washington state, which has a top-two primary system. In a top-two primary system, the top two vote-getters in the primary election advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation. This system may have made it easier for Herrera Beutler and Newhouse to win election as Republicans while still holding views that are more moderate than the party's base.

The only historical parallel to this level of Republican support for impeachment is the impeachment attempt against President Richard Nixon in 1974. In that case, five Republicans voted in favor of impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee. However, Nixon resigned before the full House could vote on impeachment.

It is also worth noting that no Democrats voted against impeaching Trump, highlighting a record level of unity within the party.

Impeachment is only the first step in the process of removing a president from office. The Senate must now hold a trial to determine whether or not to convict Trump. It is unclear how the Senate will vote, but it is unlikely that two-thirds of the Senate will vote to convict Trump, which is what would be required to remove him from office.

The impeachment of Trump is a historic event that will have a lasting impact on American politics. It is a sign of the deep divisions within the country and the challenges facing the American political system.
