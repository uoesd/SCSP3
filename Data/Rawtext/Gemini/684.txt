Justice for Chrystul Kizer: Advocates Seek Equal Treatment After Kyle Rittenhouse Acquittal

In the wake of Kyle Rittenhouse's controversial acquittal, advocates are demanding justice for Chrystul Kizer, a teenage girl who killed her alleged sex trafficker. Kizer's case has drawn comparisons to Rittenhouse's, with both claiming self-defense in their respective killings.

The Case of Chrystul Kizer

Chrystul Kizer was 17 years old when she allegedly shot and killed Randall Volar, a man awaiting trial for human trafficking. Kizer claims she acted in self-defense after Volar sexually assaulted her and threatened her life. She is currently facing multiple felony charges, including first-degree intentional homicide.

Self-Defense Claims and Rittenhouse's Acquittal

Kizer's advocates argue that her case deserves similar consideration to Rittenhouse's, who was acquitted earlier this month after killing two men during a Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha. Rittenhouse's defense successfully argued that he acted in self-defense.

"The Rittenhouse verdict sends a clear message that white men can get away with murder," said Jess Singh, a protestor and Kenosha resident. "But when a Black girl like Chrystul Kizer defends herself against her abuser, she's treated like a criminal."

Affirmative Defense and State Supreme Court Review

An appeals court has allowed Kizer to use the "affirmative defense," arguing that her actions were a direct result of being trafficked. However, the State Supreme Court is currently reviewing whether Kizer can use this defense in her trial.

Community Support and Bond

Kizer was released on bond in 2020 after community groups raised $400,000. Rittenhouse's bond was $2 million, also raised by supporters. The disparity in bond amounts has further fueled outrage among Kizer's advocates.

Demonstrations and Calls for Justice

Demonstrations were held in Kenosha to protest Rittenhouse's verdict and to bring attention to Kizer's case. Advocates are calling for Kizer to receive a fair trial and for the State Supreme Court to allow her to use the affirmative defense.

"Chrystul Kizer is a survivor who deserves justice," said one protestor. "We will not rest until she is exonerated."

Conclusion

The case of Chrystul Kizer has sparked a national debate about self-defense, race, and the treatment of victims of sex trafficking. Advocates are hopeful that Kizer will receive a fair trial and that her case will help to shed light on the systemic injustices faced by marginalized communities.
