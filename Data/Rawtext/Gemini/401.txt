Chauvin Declines to Testify in Floyd Death Trial

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin declined to testify in his own defense Friday in the trial over the death of George Floyd, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

Closing arguments in the closely watched trial are set to begin Monday, with jury deliberations to follow. The outcome is highly anticipated, prompting Minneapolis public schools to shift to distance learning in anticipation of a verdict.

The defense rested its case after two days of testimony, in contrast to the prosecution's two weeks. Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death, facing up to 40 years in prison for the most serious charge, second-degree murder.

Worldwide protests were triggered by bystander video showing Chauvin pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes as Floyd repeatedly said he couldn't breathe. Prosecutors argue Floyd died due to Chauvin's knee pressed against his neck or close to it for 9 1/2 minutes.

Defense testimony aimed to present Chauvin's actions as reasonable and suggested Floyd's death was due to health issues and drug use. The only time Chauvin has been heard defending himself was through body-camera footage shown to the jury.

Chauvin's decision not to testify is not uncommon in criminal trials, especially when the defendant faces serious charges. By invoking his Fifth Amendment right, Chauvin avoids the risk of damaging testimony that could be used against him.

However, Chauvin's silence leaves unanswered questions about his state of mind during the fatal encounter with Floyd. The jury will have to decide whether Chauvin's actions were reasonable and whether he intended to harm Floyd.

The trial is happening amid ongoing protests over another police shooting in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center. Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, was shot and killed by a white police officer during a traffic stop on April 11.

The Wright shooting has reignited tensions in Minneapolis and raised concerns about the use of force by police. The city has been under a state of emergency since the shooting, with the National Guard deployed to maintain peace.

The Chauvin trial has become a focal point for the national debate over race and policing. The outcome could have a significant impact on police practices and accountability.

The verdict in the Chauvin trial is expected to be a major moment in the ongoing struggle for racial justice in the United States.
