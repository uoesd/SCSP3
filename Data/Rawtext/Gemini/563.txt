Hometown Hero: Marine Cpl. Daegan Page Honored at Omaha Lancers Hockey Game

Omaha, Nebraska - The Omaha Lancers hockey team will pay tribute to fallen Marine Cpl. Daegan Page, who lost his life in the Kabul airport attack on August 26, 2021. Page, a member of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton, California, was among the 13 service members who made the ultimate sacrifice that day.

Visiting Angels, a home care provider, has chosen the Page family for their Hometown Hero Seat during the Lancers' game against the Sioux Falls Stampede on Saturday, March 11th. The selection was inspired by Page's love for hockey.

"Daegan would have loved this," said his mother, Wendy Adelson. "He was such a huge hockey fan."

The Hometown Hero Seat acknowledges military members, first responders, or their family members. Page's family will participate in a ceremonial puck-drop and receive a Lancers sweater in his honor.

"This is a great way to show our support for the Page family and to remember Daegan's sacrifice," said Lancers President and General Manager David Smaha. "We are honored to have them here."

The event holds special significance for the Page family, who have been grieving the loss of their son.

"It's so nice to know that people still care and remember Daegan," said Adelson. "It makes us feel like we're not alone."

A media Q&A session with the Page family will follow the puck-drop ceremony and gift presentation.

Page's legacy will continue to inspire others. His family has established the Daegan Page Memorial Foundation to support military families and veterans.

"Daegan was a hero," said Adelson. "We are so proud of him."

The Omaha Lancers encourage the community to come out and support the Page family and honor the memory of Cpl. Daegan Page. Tickets for the game can be purchased at the Lancers website or at the box office.
