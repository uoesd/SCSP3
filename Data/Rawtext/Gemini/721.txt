Remington Subpoenas Sandy Hook Victims' Records in Wrongful Death Lawsuit

In a controversial move, lawyers for Remington Arms, the manufacturer of the rifle used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, have subpoenaed academic records for five slain students. The families of the victims are vehemently opposed to the release of their children's confidential information.

The subpoena, filed in federal court in Connecticut, seeks transcripts, report cards, and other academic records for the students, who were between the ages of 6 and 7 when they were killed in the 2012 massacre. The shooting resulted in the deaths of 20 children and six adults.

"This is an outrageous invasion of privacy," said Joshua Koskoff, lead attorney for the families. "These are the records of innocent children who were murdered in a horrific act of violence. Remington has no right to them."

Remington's attorneys argue that the records are relevant to the case because they may shed light on the students' mental health and academic performance. The company is facing a wrongful death lawsuit filed by nine families of the victims, who allege that Remington recklessly marketed the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle to civilians.

The families have asked the court to seal the students' records, arguing that they are irrelevant to the case and that their release would cause further emotional distress to the families.

"These records have nothing to do with the shooting," Koskoff said. "Remington is simply trying to harass the families and intimidate them into dropping their lawsuit."

Remington filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018 and again the following year. The company has not yet responded to requests for comment on the subpoena.

In July, Remington offered a $33 million settlement to the families, but the plaintiffs have not yet responded to the offer.

The Sandy Hook shooting remains one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history. The families of the victims have been fighting for justice for their loved ones ever since. Remington's subpoena for the students' records is the latest twist in a long and painful legal battle.

"We will not be bullied or intimidated," Koskoff said. "We will continue to fight for justice for the families of Sandy Hook."
