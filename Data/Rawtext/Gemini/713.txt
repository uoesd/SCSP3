Michigan's Triumph: Big Ten Title and a Tribute to Tate Myre

Indianapolis – Michigan's 17-year Big Ten championship drought came to an emphatic end on Saturday, as the Wolverines dominated Iowa 42-3 in a resounding victory that secured their spot in the College Football Playoff for the first time.

But beyond the triumph on the field, the game carried a profound significance, as Michigan honored the memory of Tate Myre, a beloved Oxford High School football player who was killed in a tragic mass shooting earlier this year.

Myre, who wore the number 42 on his high school team, was one of four students who lost their lives in the horrific incident. His unwavering courage in trying to stop the shooter has earned him widespread recognition as a hero.

In a touching tribute, Michigan players wore a patch during the game that featured Myre's number, 42. The Wolverines also invited Myre's family to participate in the pregame coin toss, where they proudly displayed "Oxford Strong" T-shirts.

"Tate was a special young man who represented everything that is good about our community," said Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. "His memory will forever be etched in our hearts, and we are honored to have the opportunity to pay tribute to him today."

The idea to dedicate the game to Myre came from Michigan's senior defensive end, Aidan Hutchinson.

"Tate was a hero, and we wanted to do something to show our support for his family and the entire Oxford community," Hutchinson said. "This victory is for them."

Hutchinson's exceptional performance on the field earned him the game's Most Valuable Player award. The Wolverines' defense held Iowa to just 107 total yards, while the offense racked up 462 yards.

"It was an incredible feeling to be out there with my teammates and play for something bigger than ourselves," said center Andrew Vastardis. "We knew that this game was about more than just winning a championship. It was about honoring Tate and showing our support for his family."

As the final seconds ticked off the clock, the scoreboard displayed a score of 42-3. For the Michigan players and coaches, it was a poignant reminder of Myre's legacy.

"That final score was no coincidence," Harbaugh said. "It was a tribute to Tate and a symbol of the strength and resilience of the Oxford community. We will never forget him."

Myre's family expressed their gratitude for the outpouring of support from the Michigan football team and the entire university community.

"We are so touched by the way that Michigan has embraced Tate's memory," said Myre's father, William. "This victory is a testament to his spirit and the power of sports to bring people together."

The Michigan Wolverines will now turn their attention to the College Football Playoff, where they will face the Georgia Bulldogs in the Orange Bowl on December 31st. But regardless of the outcome of that game, the 2021 season will forever be remembered as the year that Michigan honored the memory of Tate Myre and brought hope and healing to the Oxford community.
