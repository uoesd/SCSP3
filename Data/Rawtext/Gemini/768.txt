'Rust' Gun Expert's Mentor Supplied Fatal Prop Gun

Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the gun expert on the "Rust" movie set where Alec Baldwin fatally shot a cinematographer, was mentored by another Arizona-based gun expert, Seth Kenney.

Kenney's company, PDQ Arm & Prop, supplied the guns used on the "Rust" set, including the Colt .45 Baldwin used. Kenney also suggested Gutierrez Reed for the "Rust" armorer position.

The investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and it is unclear what ammunition Kenney may have provided or whether he was present on the set.

Halyna Hutchins was killed and Joel Souza was wounded when Baldwin discharged a prop gun that was believed to be "cold," meaning it did not contain live ammunition.

Gutierrez Reed's lawyers have suggested possible "sabotage" on the set, with a live bullet being placed in the gun.

Reports have emerged of Gutierrez Reed's previous mishandling of firearms on another film set. Stu Brumbaugh, a key grip on the film "The Old Way," said Gutierrez Reed "was a bit careless with the guns."

"She was loading blanks into a gun that we were using for target practice, and she wasn't really paying attention to what she was doing," Brumbaugh said. "She was just kind of throwing the bullets in there."

Nicolas Cage also complained about Gutierrez Reed's handling of firearms during the production of "The Old Way."

Kenney has a previous career working with major prop houses and as a weapons consultant on films. He has worked on films such as "The Dark Knight," "Iron Man," and "The Avengers."

The investigation into the "Rust" shooting is ongoing, and it is unclear what role Kenney may have played in the incident.
