Travel Blogger's Footage Leads to Gabby Petito's Van Discovery

Travel blogger Jenn Bethune's keen eye and quick action played a pivotal role in the discovery of Gabby Petito's van, a crucial development in the investigation into her disappearance and tragic death.

Bethune's footage, captured during her trip to Grand Teton National Park, showed the white van parked at a campground. "I was just looking through my footage, and I saw this van that looked like the one that was being described in the news," Bethune said. "I immediately called the FBI."

The discovery of the van in Wyoming on September 19, 2021, marked a turning point in the case. It led to the identification of Petito's remains and the subsequent search for her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, who was later found dead in a Florida nature reserve.

ABC's "20/20" episode titled "Life on Line: The Last Days of Gabby Petito" delves into the events leading up to Petito's disappearance and the investigation that followed. The episode features interviews with Bethune, former Moab police chief Jim Winder, and experts on body language and legal analysis.

"The body cam footage from the Moab police is very telling," Winder said. "It shows that Gabby was in distress, and Brian was trying to control the situation."

The episode also includes interviews with Miranda Baker, who encountered Laundrie in Wyoming, and Jason Jensen, a private investigator and co-founder of the Cold Case Coalition. Jensen believes that Laundrie was responsible for Petito's death.

"I think he killed her in Wyoming and then drove her body back to Florida," Jensen said.

Mykel Hawke, a retired special forces combat veteran and survival expert, guides viewers through the Carlton Reserve where Laundrie's body was found. Hawke explains the challenges of searching in such a vast and unforgiving environment.

"This is a very difficult place to search," Hawke said. "The vegetation is thick, and there are a lot of obstacles."

The program also calls attention to the issue of missing persons of color and indigenous women in the same area as Petito. According to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, there are over 5,000 unsolved missing persons cases involving Native Americans.

"We need to do more to address this issue," Hawke said. "These women deserve the same attention and resources as Gabby Petito."

"Life on Line: The Last Days of Gabby Petito" is streaming on Hulu.
