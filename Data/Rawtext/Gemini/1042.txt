ERCOT Names Brad Jones as Interim CEO Amid Power Grid Scrutiny

AUSTIN, Texas – Brad Jones has been appointed as the interim president and CEO of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), replacing Bill Magness who was fired following a deadly winter storm in February that resulted in widespread power outages.

Jones previously held senior roles at ERCOT and served as president of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), the power grid operator for New York. His appointment comes as ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) face intense scrutiny over their handling of the storm.

The February storm led to more than 100 deaths and left millions without power amid freezing temperatures. ERCOT's fall projections underestimated the maximum power demand and overestimated available power generation for severe winter conditions.

In the wake of the storm, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick called for the resignations of Magness and DeAnn Walker, head of the PUC. Gov. Greg Abbott has also called for reforms in ERCOT's governance.

Lawmakers are facing pressure to pass legislation to prevent future power failures. One proposal would require ERCOT to prepare for extreme weather events and ensure sufficient power generation capacity.

The appointment of Jones is seen as a step towards addressing the concerns raised by the storm. However, Texas is likely to experience a hotter and drier summer than normal, increasing demands on the power grid.

ERCOT is responsible for managing the flow of electricity across the Texas power grid, which serves approximately 90% of the state's population. The organization has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability, as well as its reliance on voluntary measures to ensure grid reliability.

The winter storm exposed the vulnerabilities of the Texas power grid and highlighted the need for significant reforms. The appointment of Jones and the ongoing legislative efforts are crucial steps towards ensuring a more reliable and resilient power system for the future.
