Biden Administration Prepares for COVID-19 Vaccinations for Children Ages 5-11

Washington, D.C. – The Biden Administration today announced plans to make COVID-19 vaccinations for children ages 5-11 convenient, accessible, and free if authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Progress in Vaccinating the Nation

Since President Biden took office, the nation has made significant progress in vaccinating the population against COVID-19. As of today, two-thirds of eligible individuals, or 189 million Americans, are fully vaccinated. This represents a substantial increase from the 2 million individuals who were fully vaccinated when President Biden took office.

Preparing for Vaccination of Children Ages 5-11

The Administration is now preparing for the potential authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5-11 by the FDA and CDC. The timing of vaccination for children ages 5-11 will depend on the independent FDA and CDC process, but the Administration plans to begin vaccinations shortly after final CDC recommendation.

Collaboration with States, Tribes, and Territories

States, Tribes, and territories will play a significant role in the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations for children ages 5-11. The federal government will provide full reimbursement for vaccination operations, ensuring that there are no cost barriers for states and localities.

Adequate Vaccine Supply

The Administration has procured enough vaccine for the country's 28 million children ages 5-11, pending FDA authorization. The vaccine will be distributed to states, Tribes, and territories through the existing federal vaccine distribution network.

Accessible Vaccination Sites

Vaccination sites for children ages 5-11 will include doctors' offices, hospitals, pharmacies, community health centers, and school- and community-based sites. The Administration is working to ensure that vaccinations are available in convenient and accessible locations for all families.

Over 25,000 Pediatric and Primary Care Provider Sites

Over 25,000 pediatric and primary care provider sites will offer COVID-19 vaccinations for children ages 5-11. The Administration is also working to increase the number of providers enrolled in the federal vaccine distribution network to ensure that there are ample vaccination sites available.

Partnership with Children's Hospital Association

The Administration has partnered with the Children's Hospital Association to set up vaccination sites in over 100 children's hospital systems across the country. Children's hospitals will work to make vaccines accessible in trusted, family-friendly settings and provide information to parents about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for children.

Conclusion

The Biden Administration is committed to ensuring that all Americans have access to free, convenient, and safe COVID-19 vaccinations. The Administration is working closely with states, Tribes, territories, and healthcare providers to prepare for the potential authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5-11. The Administration is confident that it will be able to vaccinate children ages 5-11 quickly and efficiently once the vaccine is authorized.
