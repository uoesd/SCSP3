Biden Administration Announces Sweeping COVID-19 Vaccination Policies to Protect Workers, Save Lives, and Strengthen the Economy

Washington, D.C. – Today, the Biden Administration announced two major COVID-19 vaccination policies that will significantly increase vaccination rates and protect workers across the United States. These policies, implemented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), will require employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or tested weekly, and mandate health care workers at Medicare and Medicaid participating facilities to be fully vaccinated.

OSHA Vaccine and Testing Mandate for Employers with 100+ Employees

The OSHA Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) requires employers with 100 or more employees to develop, implement, and enforce a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy. Employers can choose to implement either a vaccination-only policy or a vaccination-or-testing policy. Under the vaccination-only policy, all employees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Under the vaccination-or-testing policy, employees who are not fully vaccinated must be tested for COVID-19 at least weekly and provide documentation of their test results.

In addition, the ETS requires employers to provide paid time off for employees to get vaccinated and recover from any side effects. Employers must also ensure that unvaccinated employees wear face coverings in the workplace.

CMS Vaccine Mandate for Health Care Workers

The CMS Interim Final Rule requires all health care workers at Medicare and Medicaid participating facilities to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. This rule applies to all hospitals, nursing homes, dialysis facilities, ambulatory surgical centers, and home health agencies that participate in Medicare or Medicaid.

Protecting Workers, Preventing Hospitalizations, Saving Lives, and Strengthening the Economy

These new policies are essential to protect workers, prevent hospitalizations, save lives, and strengthen the economy. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and its severe consequences. By increasing vaccination rates, these policies will help to reduce workplace outbreaks, protect workers from serious illness and death, and keep businesses open.

Coverage and Compliance

The OSHA and CMS requirements cover over 100 million workers in the United States. Employers must comply with these requirements by January 4, 2022.

Proven Effectiveness of Vaccination Mandates

Vaccination mandates have been shown to be highly effective in increasing vaccination rates. In organizations that have implemented vaccination mandates, vaccination rates have increased by over 20 percentage points.

Economic Benefits of Vaccination Requirements

Economists unanimously agree that vaccination requirements will lead to a faster and stronger economic recovery. By reducing workplace outbreaks and keeping businesses open, vaccination requirements will help to stabilize the economy and create jobs.

Preemption of Inconsistent State and Local Laws

The OSHA and CMS rules preempt any inconsistent state or local laws that limit employers' authority to require vaccinations, masks, or testing. This ensures that employers can implement these policies without fear of legal challenges.

Conclusion

The Biden Administration's COVID-19 vaccination policies are a critical step towards protecting workers, preventing hospitalizations, saving lives, and strengthening the economy. These policies are based on science, proven effective, and supported by economists. The Administration urges all employers and health care workers to comply with these requirements and do their part to end the pandemic.
