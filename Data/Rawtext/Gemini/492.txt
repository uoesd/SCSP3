Hurricane Ida Disrupts Energy Production and Distribution in the Gulf of Mexico

Hurricane Ida, a powerful Category 4 storm, made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, on August 29, causing significant disruptions to energy production and distribution in the Gulf of Mexico.

According to the U.S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, 96% of crude oil production and 94% of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico were shut in due to the hurricane. At least nine refineries also shut down or reduced production, including Marathon Petroleum's Garyville refinery in Louisiana and Valero Energy's St. Charles refinery in Texas.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has revised its September Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) forecasts for crude oil production and refinery runs in light of the hurricane's impact. Crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to return to previously forecast levels in October, but refinery runs are expected to remain below pre-hurricane levels.

Gross inputs into Gulf Coast refineries fell by 1.6 million barrels per day following the hurricane, and crude oil inventories in the Gulf Coast fell by 2.6 million barrels. U.S. crude oil production also fell by 1.5 million b/d from August 27 to September 3.

In addition to Hurricane Ida, Hurricane Nicholas, a Category 1 storm, made landfall near Houston on September 14, impacting Colonial Pipeline operations. Trade press reports indicate that Colonial Pipeline has resumed normal operations, and the Houston Ship Channel is expected to reopen soon.

The disruptions caused by Hurricanes Ida and Nicholas are expected to have a short-term impact on energy markets. However, the long-term effects of the storms remain to be seen.
