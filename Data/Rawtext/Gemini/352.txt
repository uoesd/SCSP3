Facebook Whistleblower Accuses Company of Prioritizing Profit over Safety

Oct 3 (Reuters) – Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen accused the social media giant of prioritizing profit over combating hate speech and misinformation, prompting an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook's Civic Misinformation Team, filed at least eight complaints with the SEC, alleging that Facebook misled investors about its efforts to address harmful content on its platforms.

"Facebook has repeatedly misled the public about what its own research reveals about the safety of its products," Haugen said in a statement. "The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people."

Haugen's allegations were first reported in a series of Wall Street Journal articles that scrutinized Facebook's practices. She subsequently revealed her identity on the CBS program "60 Minutes."

The whistleblower will testify at a Senate subcommittee hearing titled "Protecting Kids Online" on Tuesday, October 5th, to discuss Instagram's impact on teens. Haugen claims that Facebook was aware of its platforms fostering discord and harming teens but prioritized its financial interests.

"Facebook's own research shows that it is actively making hate speech and misinformation worse," Haugen said. "The company has blood on its hands."

Facebook has contested Haugen's accusations, with spokesperson Lena Pietsch asserting that the company has made ongoing improvements in curbing harmful content.

"We have invested heavily in people and technology to keep our platform safe and secure," Pietsch said. "We will continue to make improvements as needed."

Facebook VP of global affairs Nick Clegg called the idea that social media caused the January 6 Capitol riot "ludicrous."

"The idea that social media is responsible for the Capitol riot is ludicrous," Clegg said. "The responsibility lies with those who stormed the Capitol, not with social media companies."

Haugen's attorney confirmed sharing internal documents with several state attorneys general and expressed intentions to discuss regulatory actions internationally.

"We are working with state attorneys general and regulators around the world to hold Facebook accountable for its actions," said John Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid, a non-profit organization supporting Haugen.

Whistleblower Aid has launched a GoFundMe to support Haugen's legal expenses. The campaign has raised over $100,000 as of October 3rd.

"Frances Haugen is a courageous whistleblower who is standing up for the public interest," Tye said. "We are proud to support her in her fight to hold Facebook accountable."
