Johnson Inspired by Brady's Success at 43

ST. PETERSBURG – Racing legend Jimmie Johnson is drawing inspiration from NFL star Tom Brady's remarkable career at 43.

Both Johnson and Brady have achieved unparalleled success in their respective sports, with seven championships each. Johnson, who turns 46 in September, admires Brady's longevity and the message it sends to athletes in their 40s.

"It's inspiring to see Tom still playing at such a high level," Johnson said. "It shows that age is just a number, and that if you're willing to put in the work, you can still compete at the highest level."

Johnson's own career has taken a new turn, as he has transitioned from NASCAR to IndyCar. This move mirrors Brady's decision to switch teams from the New England Patriots to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

"I think it's great to see athletes embrace new challenges," Johnson said. "It shows that they're not afraid to step outside of their comfort zone and try something different."

Johnson made his IndyCar debut in February, finishing 19th. He is eager to compete in the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg this weekend.

"I'm really looking forward to racing in St. Petersburg," Johnson said. "It's a great track, and I think we have a good car. I'm just going to go out there and try to do my best."

Brady's work ethic and ability to win a Super Bowl after changing teams is particularly inspiring to Johnson.

"Tom is a true professional," Johnson said. "He's always prepared, and he always gives 100%. It's no surprise that he's been so successful."

The Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg will be held on March 25-27. Gates will open at intersections of First Avenue SE and First Street SE; Second Street S and Fifth Avenue S.

IndyCar qualifying for the event is scheduled for 1:45 p.m. Saturday, with the IndyCar race at 12:42 p.m. Sunday. The race will be broadcast on NBC.

Up to 20,000 fans per day are allowed at the event, with advance ticket sales only. Tickets can be purchased at www.gpstpete.com.
