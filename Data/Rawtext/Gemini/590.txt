Kamala Harris Makes History as First Female, Black, and South Asian Vice President

WASHINGTON (AP) – Kamala Harris shattered multiple glass ceilings Wednesday, becoming the first female, first Black, and first South Asian vice president of the United States.

In her inaugural address at the Lincoln Memorial, Harris hailed the moment as a testament to "American aspiration."

"Today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman, the first Black woman, the first woman of South Asian descent, and the first daughter of immigrants to hold the second highest office in our land," she said. "And while I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last."

Harris was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, using a Bible that belonged to Thurgood Marshall, the first Black Supreme Court justice. Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, who defended the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, escorted her to the podium.

Her inauguration is seen as a watershed moment in American history, representing significant progress in both gender and racial equality.

"This is a day of celebration and a day of reflection," said Lateefah Simon, a civil rights advocate and friend of Harris. "It's a reminder of how far we've come, but also how much work we still have to do."

Harris' diverse background is reflective of many Americans' stories, bringing important perspectives to the administration.

"She represents the future of our country," said Elizabeth Shelby, a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, of which Harris is also a member. "She's a role model for young girls everywhere, showing them that anything is possible."

Harris presided over the Senate as Vice President for the first time Wednesday, swearing in three new Democratic senators.

Before becoming vice president, Harris served as a Senator from California and ran for the presidency herself.

Her historic inauguration was celebrated by members of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and others across the country.

President Joe Biden mentioned Harris' historic election in his inaugural address, marking it as a sign of progress.

"We have a new vice president who represents the best of our nation," Biden said. "She's a trailblazer, a role model, and an inspiration."

Experts believe Harris' vice presidency will redefine political power in America and stress the significance of Black women's leadership.

"This is a historic moment that will have a lasting impact on our country," said Martha S. Jones, a professor of history at Johns Hopkins University. "Kamala Harris' election is a testament to the power of representation and the importance of diversity in our government."

Harris' inauguration is a reminder that the American dream is still alive and well. It is a day of celebration and a day of hope for a more just and equitable future.
