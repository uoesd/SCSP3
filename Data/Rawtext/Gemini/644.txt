Portland Declares Riot as Protesters Rage Over Rittenhouse Acquittal

Portland, Ore. - Law enforcement in Portland declared a riot on Saturday night as approximately 200 demonstrators protested the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse. The protests turned violent, with protesters breaking windows, throwing objects at police, and discussing plans to burn down a government building.

Several people were issued citations, and one person was arrested on an outstanding warrant. The unrest in Portland followed similar protests in several other U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

In Chicago, around 1,000 people marched in a protest organized by Black Lives Matter Chicago and other groups. Tanya Watkins, executive director of Southsiders Organized for Unity and Liberation, expressed her outrage at the verdict.

"We are disappointed and enraged by the verdict," Watkins said. "It sends a clear message that white people can kill Black people with impunity."

In North Carolina, dozens of protesters gathered near the state Capitol, accompanied by police officers on motorcycles. The protests remained peaceful, but demonstrators expressed their anger over the Rittenhouse acquittal.

Portland Police Bureau Chief Chuck Lovell said officers were prepared for the protests following the Rittenhouse verdict.

"We had a plan in place to ensure the safety of our community and our officers," Lovell said. "We are committed to protecting the First Amendment rights of protesters, but we will not tolerate violence or destruction of property."

Some demonstrators in Portland threw urine, water bottles, and batteries at deputies. Police responded with tear gas and flash bangs to disperse the crowd.

Rittenhouse was acquitted of killing two people and injuring another during a Wisconsin protest against police brutality in August 2020. The verdict has sparked outrage among many who believe it sends a message that white people can use deadly force against protesters with impunity.

The protests over the Rittenhouse verdict are a reminder of the deep divisions in American society over race, justice, and the use of force by police. It remains to be seen whether the protests will continue or escalate in the coming days.
