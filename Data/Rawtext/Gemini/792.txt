Biden Executive Order Expedites Stimulus Checks for Millions

President Joe Biden has issued an executive order aimed at accelerating the delivery of stimulus checks to an estimated 8 million Americans who missed out on earlier rounds of payments.

The order directs the Treasury Department to re-evaluate its delivery methods for stimulus checks and to create online tools and outreach efforts to help eligible individuals claim their missed payments.

"This is an important step to ensure that all Americans who are entitled to these payments receive them," said Samantha Jacoby, senior tax legal analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "These payments can make a real difference in the lives of low-income individuals and families who have been struggling during the pandemic."

The Treasury Department is tasked with identifying the individuals who missed out on the first round of stimulus checks, which were authorized by the CARES Act in March 2020. The department will then work to send these individuals their payments as quickly as possible.

The IRS has already launched an online non-filer tool to help eligible individuals claim their missed payments. However, IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig reported that as of last fall, 8 million eligible people had not used the non-filer portal.

"We are committed to getting these payments out to all eligible Americans as quickly as possible," Rettig said. "We urge anyone who has not yet received their payment to visit the IRS website and use the non-filer tool."

The Biden administration's efforts to address the issue of missed stimulus payments are part of a broader effort to provide financial relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. The administration has also proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus package that would include additional direct payments to Americans.

The number of Americans who missed out on stimulus checks could be even higher than 8 million. The IRS has estimated that as many as 12 million eligible individuals did not receive the first round of payments.

The Biden administration is committed to ensuring that all entitled Americans receive their stimulus checks. The executive order issued by President Biden is a significant step towards achieving this goal.
