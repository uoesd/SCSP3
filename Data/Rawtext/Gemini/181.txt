Intermountain Healthcare to Mandate COVID-19 Vaccinations for Caregivers

Salt Lake City, Utah - Intermountain Healthcare, Utah's largest healthcare provider, will require all caregivers to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by January 4, 2022, due to pending federal rules.

The federal government has announced that Medicare and Medicaid will only cover services from healthcare providers with fully vaccinated employees. This mandate affects all healthcare providers who receive federal funding, including hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes.

"This step is necessary to continue caring for our patients with federal health insurance," said Dr. Mark Briesacher, chief physician executive at Intermountain Healthcare. "We have a responsibility to protect our patients, our caregivers, and our communities from COVID-19."

Approximately 80% of Intermountain's care providers are already fully vaccinated. Employees may seek exemptions for medical or religious reasons, similar to other vaccination requirements. Unvaccinated employees without exemptions will be placed on administrative leave starting January 5, 2022, and could face potential separation from the organization by February 9, 2022.

It is unclear how many employees may choose to quit or be fired rather than comply with the vaccine mandate. However, other healthcare providers in Utah, including University of Utah Health, have already required employee vaccinations without significant staffing disruptions.

President Joe Biden announced federal vaccination requirements in September, affecting healthcare providers and large employers with more than 100 employees. The Utah Legislature cannot effectively intervene due to the federal funding Intermountain Healthcare receives.

"The federal government has the authority to impose these requirements on healthcare providers," said Utah Speaker Brad Wilson. "The state legislature cannot override federal law."

Intermountain Healthcare is working to provide support and resources to employees who need to get vaccinated. The organization is also offering paid time off for employees to get vaccinated and recover from any side effects.

"We understand that this is a difficult decision for some people," said Dr. Briesacher. "But we believe that it is the right thing to do to protect our patients, our caregivers, and our communities."
