Hurricane Ida's Remnants Unleash Fury on Mid-Atlantic, Causing Widespread Flooding and Damage

NEW YORK (AP) – The remnants of Hurricane Ida brought a trail of destruction to the mid-Atlantic states on Wednesday, unleashing at least two tornadoes, heavy winds, and drenching rains that caused widespread flooding, submerged cars and roads, and disrupted transportation.

New Jersey

In New Jersey, the storm's impact was particularly severe. A U.S. Postal Service building in Kearny collapsed under the weight of water, and widespread flooding led to cars being submerged and roads impassable.

"We've had multiple roads closed due to flooding," said Sgt. Chris Levchak, a police sergeant in Kearny. "We're urging people to stay off the roads if they don't have to be out."

Newark Liberty International Airport experienced significant flooding, forcing the suspension of all flights and train service. The airport's runways were submerged in water, and the terminal was evacuated.

"The flooding at the airport was unprecedented," said Scott Goldstein, Montgomery County Fire Chief. "We had to evacuate the terminal and move people to higher ground."

Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency in all of New Jersey's 21 counties, urging people to stay off flooded roads.

Pennsylvania

In Pennsylvania, thousands were evacuated due to dangerous levels at a dam near Johnstown, known as "Flood City." The Wilmore and Hinckston Run Dams were also being monitored for stability due to high-hazard conditions.

"We're keeping a close eye on the dams," said a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency. "We're urging people to evacuate if they're in low-lying areas."

New York

New York City was also hit hard by the storm. Central Park recorded 3.15 inches of rain in one hour, breaking the previous record set by Tropical Storm Henri. The city's subway stations and tracks were so flooded that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority suspended all service.

"The flooding in the subway system was the worst we've seen in years," said a spokesperson for the MTA. "We're working to pump out the water and restore service as soon as possible."

Maryland and Virginia

The storm also affected Maryland and Virginia, resulting in at least one death and significant property damage. In Maryland, a man was killed when a tree fell on his car in Montgomery County. In Virginia, several homes were damaged by flooding in Fairfax County.

Tropical Storm Larry

As the remnants of Hurricane Ida moved away from the mid-Atlantic, Tropical Storm Larry was forming off the coast of Africa. The storm is expected to become a major hurricane by Saturday and could threaten the Caribbean and the United States.

"We're monitoring Tropical Storm Larry closely," said a spokesperson for the National Hurricane Center. "It's too early to say what impact it will have on the United States, but we're urging people to stay informed and be prepared."
