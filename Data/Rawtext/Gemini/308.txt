Ever Given Freed from Suez Canal After Five-Day Blockage

Suez, Egypt - The colossal Ever Given container ship, which has been blocking the Suez Canal for the past five days, has finally been freed, ending a major disruption to global trade.

The ship, which became wedged across the canal on March 23, caused a massive traffic jam of over 360 vessels waiting to pass through the vital waterway. The blockage has had a significant impact on global supply chains, potentially costing billions of dollars in delayed shipments.

After days of intense efforts, dredgers and tugboats, aided by a spring tide from a full moon, managed to dislodge the ship from the canal's banks. The Ever Given is now being towed to the Great Bitter Lake for inspection and repairs.

Initially, high winds during a sandstorm were blamed for the incident, but technical or human errors are also being investigated. The blockage forced some ships to take a longer route around Africa, raising concerns about piracy.

The Suez Canal is a critical maritime link, and the blockage threatened significant economic impacts worldwide. Egypt operates the canal, which contributed $5.6 billion to its revenue in 2020.

The Ever Given, operated by Evergreen Marine of Taiwan, is a Panama-flagged ship built in 2018. It is one of the largest container ships in the world, with a capacity of over 20,000 containers.

The successful refloating of the Ever Given is a major relief for the global shipping industry and the world economy. However, the incident has highlighted the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to disruptions and the need for contingency plans.
