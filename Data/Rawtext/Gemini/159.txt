Colin Powell, Former Secretary of State, Dies at 84 from COVID-19 Complications

Washington, D.C. - Colin Powell, the first Black U.S. Secretary of State, passed away on October 18 at the age of 84 due to complications from COVID-19. Powell, who had an estimated net worth of $60 million at the time of his death, is survived by his wife, Alma Johnson, their daughters Linda and Annemarie, and son Michael.

Powell's distinguished career spanned several decades, including roles as National Security Advisor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a military retirement in 1993. He was widely respected for his leadership and diplomacy, earning him numerous accolades, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom twice.

"Colin Powell was a great public servant, a true patriot, and a man of character," said former President George W. Bush. "He was a dear friend and I will miss him dearly."

Powell's military career began with a White House Fellowship in 1972, during the Nixon administration. He went on to serve under Presidents Carter, Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, before being appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff by President Clinton in 1989.

In this role, Powell played a pivotal role in the Gulf War, leading the U.S. military to victory. He retired from the military in 1993 and went on to pursue a successful career as an author and speaker.

Powell's autobiography, "My American Journey," became a bestseller, and he earned substantial income from speaking engagements. In 2000 alone, he reportedly earned $7 million from 109 speeches.

Post-military, Powell engaged in entrepreneurial ventures and served on various boards and campaigns. He also founded America's Promise Alliance in 1997, a nonprofit organization focused on improving the lives of young people.

"Colin Powell was a trailblazer who inspired generations of Americans," said Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY). "As a fellow New Yorker and City College alumnus, his legacy of high accomplishment and service will continue to motivate us all."

Powell's passing has been met with widespread mourning and tributes from leaders across the political spectrum. He will be remembered as a dedicated public servant, a visionary leader, and a role model for countless Americans.
