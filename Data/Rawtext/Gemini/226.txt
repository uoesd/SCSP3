Fuel Hoarding Grips Southeast as Pipeline Shutdown Sparks Panic

ATLANTA, May 12 (Reuters) – Drivers in the Southeast United States are ignoring government pleas not to hoard fuel amidst a major pipeline shutdown, leading to long lines at gas stations, fistfights, and a surge in gasoline prices.

The shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline, which supplies nearly half of the East Coast's fuel, has heavily impacted the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. The pipeline was hit by a ransomware hack on Friday, forcing its operator to shut down operations.

"I've been waiting in line for over an hour," said Ronald Ross, a DoorDash driver in Atlanta. "I need gas to work, but it's impossible to find."

James Jones, a contractor in Atlanta, said he witnessed a fistfight at a gas station over the last remaining pump. "People are getting desperate," he said.

Nearly 60% of gas stations in metro Atlanta were without fuel on Wednesday, according to GasBuddy. In Charlotte, Raleigh, and Pensacola, over 70% of stations were out of gas.

The average national gasoline price rose to above $3.00 a gallon on Wednesday, the highest since October 2014. In some areas of the Southeast, prices have topped $4.00 a gallon.

The Biden administration has warned against hoarding and filling plastic bags with fuel. "Hoarding is not going to help," said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. "It's only going to make the situation worse."

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp temporarily suspended gas taxes to ease price hikes.

Despite official advice, some individuals are going to lengths to stockpile fuel. "I'm filling up every gas can I can find," said one driver in Charlotte. "I'm not taking any chances."

Industry representatives are pleading with drivers to stay calm and not exacerbate the situation by hoarding. "Hoarding is not the answer," said Rob Underwood, president of Energy Marketers of America. "It's going to make the problem worse for everyone."

Cherie Thomas, manager of an Exxon Mobil station in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, said she has been working around the clock to keep up with demand. "We're running out of gas as soon as we get it," she said. "It's a nightmare."

The Colonial Pipeline shutdown is expected to last several days, but it could take weeks to fully restore operations. The Biden administration is working with the company to expedite the process.

In the meantime, drivers are urged to conserve fuel and avoid unnecessary travel. "This is a temporary situation," said Granholm. "We will get through this together."
