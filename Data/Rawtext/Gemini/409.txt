Chauvin's Knee on Floyd's Neck Now Estimated to Be at Least Nine Minutes

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – Prosecutors in the trial of Derek Chauvin have adjusted the duration of time his knee was on George Floyd's neck to about nine minutes, according to recent filings.

The initial estimate was 8 minutes, 46 seconds, but was later corrected to 7:46 due to a mathematical error. However, recent filings citing police body-camera video have now adjusted the duration to at least nine minutes.

"The exact duration of the restraint is anticipated to be a significant part of the trial, relating to Floyd's cause of death and Chauvin's state of mind," said a former prosecutor who requested anonymity.

Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter for the death of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died after Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on his neck for an extended period during an arrest on May 25, 2020. Three other officers are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter and are scheduled for trial in August.

The 8:46 timing became symbolic, prompting demonstrations and acts of remembrance lasting 8 minutes, 46 seconds. However, prosecutors acknowledged a one-minute error in the initial timing but stated it would not affect the case.

"The revised timing from prosecutors indicates Chauvin's restraint lasted at least nine minutes but possibly up to 9 minutes, 31 seconds," said Toshira Garraway, founder of Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence. "This adjustment is significant because it provides a more accurate account of the length of time that Chauvin's knee was on Floyd's neck, which is a key factor in determining his culpability."

The discrepancies in the timing are not expected to impact Chauvin's trial, according to Garraway and the former prosecutor. They both emphasized that the focus of the trial should be on the totality of the evidence, including video footage, witness testimony, and expert analysis.

"While the exact duration of the restraint is important, it is not the only factor that will be considered by the jury," said the former prosecutor. "The jury will also need to consider the circumstances leading up to the restraint, Chauvin's intent, and the reasonableness of his actions."

The trial is expected to last several weeks and is being closely watched by the nation and the world. The outcome of the trial will have significant implications for police accountability and racial justice in the United States.
