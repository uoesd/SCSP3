Rittenhouse Announces ASU Attendance, University Clarifies Application Status

Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager acquitted of murder charges in the 2020 Kenosha shootings, has announced his intention to attend Arizona State University (ASU) in-person for the spring semester. However, the university has clarified that Rittenhouse has not yet applied and is welcome to do so like any other applicant.

"Mr. Rittenhouse is not currently enrolled at ASU," said Jay Thorne, an ASU spokesperson. "He has not applied for admission for the spring semester. If he chooses to apply, he will go through the same admissions process as any other applicant."

Rittenhouse previously took a "compassionate withdrawal" from two online nursing classes at ASU. Following his trial and acquittal last month, he expressed his intent to pursue an undergraduate degree and eventually go to law school.

"I'm still an admitted student at ASU," Rittenhouse claimed in a podcast appearance. "I have my student portfolio and everything."

Thorne provided a statement to Forbes regarding Rittenhouse's application status: "Arizona State University does not comment on the admissions status of individual applicants. All applicants are treated equally and fairly, and their applications are reviewed in accordance with the university's admissions policies and procedures."

Rittenhouse's potential attendance at ASU has sparked controversy on campus. Protests have been held both against and in support of his enrollment. Some students have expressed concerns about his presence on campus, while others have defended his right to attend.

A representative for Rittenhouse did not immediately respond to Forbes' request for comment.
