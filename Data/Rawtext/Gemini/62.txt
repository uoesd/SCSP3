House Panel Subpoenas Six Trump Associates in Capitol Riot Probe

Washington, D.C. - The House of Representatives committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot has issued subpoenas to six former Trump associates, demanding testimony and documents related to their alleged involvement in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.

"The Select Committee is investigating the facts, circumstances, and causes of the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol," said Representative Bennie Thompson (D-MS), Chair of the committee. "We need to understand what happened that day and who is responsible."

The subpoenas were issued to Bill Stepien, Jason Miller, Angela McCallum, John Eastman, Michael Flynn, and Bernard Kerik. These individuals are accused of helping former President Donald Trump spread false claims about election fraud and being involved in efforts to stop the certification of President Joe Biden's election victory.

Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for incitement of insurrection after his supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an attempt to prevent the certification of Biden's victory. He was acquitted by the Senate.

The House panel is investigating the spread of misinformation about the election and plans to prevent the Electoral College vote count. The committee has interviewed over 150 people across government, social media, and law enforcement.

Some former Trump advisers, including Steve Bannon, have resisted testifying in the probe. Bannon was indicted on contempt of Congress charges for refusing to comply with a subpoena.

Trump has attempted to use executive privilege to block access to White House documents related to the riot, but the Biden administration has refused.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki emphasized the administration's cooperation with investigations to prevent such events in the future. "We believe it's important for the American people to understand what happened on January 6th and to hold those responsible accountable," Psaki said.

The subpoenas issued by the House panel are a significant step in the investigation into the Capitol riot. The committee is expected to continue its work in the coming months, and further subpoenas and indictments are possible.
