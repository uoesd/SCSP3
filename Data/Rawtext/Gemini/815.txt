Thousands of Americans Abroad Received Stimulus Checks During COVID-19 Pandemic

Millions of Dollars Sent Overseas

Thousands of Americans living abroad received stimulus checks during the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 3.7 million payments worth $5.5 billion sent outside the 50 states and Washington, D.C. These payments were part of three rounds of pandemic-era payments authorized by Congress, which aimed to provide financial relief to households struggling with the economic fallout of the pandemic.

Eligibility and Distribution

Eligible recipients included U.S. citizens living abroad, military members stationed overseas, and residents of U.S. territories. The payments were technically advance payments of the recovery rebate tax credit, which is a refundable tax credit that reduces the amount of taxes owed. The primary intent of the checks was to support household finances amid the pandemic.

"The location of U.S. citizens doesn't matter in a global pandemic," said Kyle Pomerleau, Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. "These payments were designed to help Americans, regardless of where they reside."

Mistaken Payments

While the vast majority of payments were made correctly, there were some instances of mistaken payments, including to non-citizens and in the form of duplicate payments. The IRS reportedly correctly paid at least 98% of first-round funds, despite some errors.

"The IRS made a good-faith effort to get these payments out quickly," said Janet Holtzblatt, Senior Fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. "But there were bound to be some mistakes given the complexity of the program."

Overseas Payments a Small Portion

The overseas payments accounted for less than 1% of the total stimulus funds distributed. The vast majority of payments went to recipients within the United States.

"These payments were a small part of the overall stimulus package," said Garrett Watson, Senior Policy Analyst at the Tax Foundation. "But they were still important for supporting Americans living abroad who were also facing economic hardship during the pandemic."

Conclusion

The distribution of stimulus checks to Americans living abroad highlights the global reach of the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of providing financial assistance to all Americans, regardless of their location. While there were some errors in the distribution process, the vast majority of payments were made correctly and provided much-needed relief to households during a challenging time.
