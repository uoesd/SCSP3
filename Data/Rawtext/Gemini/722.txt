Farmington High School Students Charged in Alleged School Shooting Plot

FARMINGTON – Two Farmington High School students have been charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated battery, a third-degree felony, for allegedly planning a school shooting.

The investigation began after a school resource officer was alerted about the plan by a school administrator. A detailed map of the school and a list of supplies for the shooting were uncovered during the investigation.

"We take these threats very seriously and will not tolerate any behavior that puts our students or staff at risk," said Farmington Police Chief Steve Hebbe.

The Farmington School District and the Farmington Police Department are collaborating closely on the case. Superintendent Gene Schmidt emphasized the importance of community vigilance and reporting suspicious activities.

"We are grateful to the student who came forward with this information," Schmidt said. "It is a reminder that we all have a role to play in keeping our schools safe."

A third student is under investigation in connection with the alleged shooting plan. The accused students reportedly did not have access to firearms at their homes.

"We are still investigating the extent of their involvement and the potential threat they posed," said Nicole Brown, spokesperson for the Farmington Police.

The information came to light due to a concerned student reporting the plan. Officials are urging students and parents to report any suspicious activities or concerns.

"If you see something, say something," Hebbe said. "Your vigilance can help prevent tragedies."

The school district has implemented additional security measures, including increased police presence and enhanced surveillance. Counselors are also available to provide support to students and staff.

"We are committed to providing a safe and supportive learning environment for all of our students," Schmidt said. "We will continue to work closely with law enforcement to ensure the safety of our school community."

The investigation is ongoing, and further charges may be filed. The accused students are scheduled to appear in court for a preliminary hearing on March 15.
