Tom Brady Launches 'Brady': A New Fashion Label Set to Rival Jordan Brand

Legendary quarterback Tom Brady is venturing into the fashion world with the launch of his eponymous label, 'Brady'. Set to debut in December, the brand will offer a range of activewear and training clothes.

Brady has partnered with Jens Grede, cofounder of Skims, and Dao-Yi Chow, cofounder of Public School New York, to bring his vision to life. Grede, who will serve as the brand's cofounder and CEO, has a proven track record of building successful direct-to-consumer fashion brands.

"We're not just making another celebrity brand," Grede said. "We want to build one of the largest namesake sportswear brands in the world, comparable to Michael Jordan's Jordan Brand."

Grede's involvement has raised expectations for the brand's launch. His previous ventures, including Skims and Good American, have generated combined revenue of $500 million in 2021.

"Tom is a true icon, and we're thrilled to be working with him," said Chow. "His passion for excellence and attention to detail are evident in everything he does, and we believe that will translate into a truly exceptional brand."

The 'Brady' brand has been in development for three years, with a focus on creating the finest sports brand in the world. The label's debut collection will feature a range of high-performance activewear, including leggings, sports bras, hoodies, and training shorts.

"I've always been passionate about fashion and fitness," said Brady. "With 'Brady,' we're creating a brand that combines the best of both worlds, offering stylish and functional clothing that empowers people to live their best lives."

Grede's expertise in building successful direct-to-consumer brands is expected to play a crucial role in the launch and growth of 'Brady'. The brand will leverage digital marketing and social media to connect with its target audience.

"We're confident that 'Brady' will resonate with people who are looking for high-quality, stylish, and functional activewear," said Grede. "We're excited to see the brand grow and become a global leader in the sportswear industry."
