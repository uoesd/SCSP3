Harris Visits NASA Goddard, Highlights Climate Science and Earth Observation

Greenbelt, Maryland - Vice President Kamala Harris visited NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center on Monday, underscoring the critical role of space science in tackling the climate crisis and advancing Earth observation.

"We are here today because we know that the climate crisis is real, and it is urgent," Harris said. "And we know that NASA has a vital role to play in addressing this crisis."

NASA Administrator Bill Nelson presented the first images from Landsat 9, the latest in a series of satellites that have been monitoring Earth's land surfaces for nearly 50 years. The images, taken on October 31, showcase iconic locations such as the Great Lakes, the Nile River Delta, and the Amazon rainforest.

"These images are a testament to the power of Earth observation," Nelson said. "They show us how our planet is changing, and they provide us with critical data that we need to make informed decisions about how to protect our environment."

Harris emphasized the multifaceted benefits of space activities, including climate action, education, economic growth, innovation, inspiration, security, and strength. She highlighted the importance of investing in NASA's missions and supporting the next generation of scientists and engineers.

"We need to make sure that we are investing in the future of space exploration," Harris said. "We need to make sure that we are investing in the next generation of scientists and engineers."

The Vice President also discussed the new Earth Venture Mission-3 (EVM-3), named INCUS, which will study the development of storms. INCUS will provide valuable data to improve weather forecasting and help communities prepare for extreme weather events.

"This mission is going to help us better understand how storms develop and how they impact our communities," Harris said. "It's going to help us save lives and protect property."

The Biden-Harris Administration has made addressing the climate crisis a top priority. NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) are working together to provide critical climate data that is essential for understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change.

"Climate data is essential for understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change," said Rick Spinrad, Ph.D., NOAA Administrator. "NASA, NOAA, and USGS are working together to provide this data to decision-makers and the public."

Harris met with scientists and engineers at Goddard to discuss NASA's role in tackling climate challenges. She toured the facility and operated a robotic arm that will be used on future Landsat 7 missions. She also visited the under-construction PACE mission, which will assess the health of the world's oceans.

"I am so impressed by the work that NASA is doing to address the climate crisis," Harris said. "I am confident that NASA will continue to play a vital role in protecting our planet and ensuring a sustainable future for all."

Tanya Trujillo, Assistant Secretary for Water and Science at the Department of the Interior, emphasized the importance of collaboration between government agencies and the private sector in addressing climate change.

"We need to work together to find solutions to the climate crisis," Trujillo said. "We need to bring together the best minds from government, academia, and the private sector."

Harris' visit to Goddard highlights the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to addressing the climate crisis and advancing Earth observation. NASA, NOAA, and USGS are playing a critical role in providing the data and tools that are essential for understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change.
