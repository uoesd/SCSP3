Greenville Man Charged in Capitol Riot

A South Carolina man, Andrew Hatley, is facing federal charges for his alleged participation in the January 6th Capitol riot. Hatley was identified through witness statements, photographs, and a cellphone tracking app, according to court documents.

Hatley, 31, of Greenville, was arrested on January 15th and charged with entering a restricted building without authority and impeding government business. He made his initial appearance in federal court in Greenville on January 18th and was released on bond.

According to the criminal complaint, Hatley was identified through a witness who provided the FBI with photographs of him inside the Capitol building. The witness also provided information about Hatley's social media activity, which included a selfie he took in front of a statue of John C. Calhoun inside the Capitol.

The FBI also used the "Life360" location-tracking app to verify Hatley's presence at the Capitol on January 6th. The app showed that Hatley's phone was in the vicinity of the Capitol building for several hours that day.

Federal authorities contacted Hatley on January 12th and interviewed him about his involvement in the riot. Hatley initially denied entering the Capitol building, but later admitted to doing so after being shown the photographs.

In a Facebook post that has since been taken down, Hatley denied involvement in breaching the Capitol. He claimed that he was only there to "witness history" and that he did not participate in any violence or property damage.

The FBI's Columbia field office had no substantial involvement in Hatley's investigation, according to spokesperson Agent Don Wood. Wood said that the investigation was led by the FBI's Washington Field Office.

More than 200 people have been charged in connection to the January 6th riot, which resulted in five deaths. The FBI is continuing to investigate the attack and is seeking the public's assistance in identifying and apprehending those who participated.
