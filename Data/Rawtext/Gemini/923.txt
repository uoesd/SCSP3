Brady Impresses Arians with Full-Speed Return to Practice

Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Bruce Arians expressed his admiration for Tom Brady's swift recovery and full participation in the team's first minicamp practice. Brady, who underwent minor knee surgery following the Buccaneers' Super Bowl victory in February, has shown remarkable progress in his rehabilitation.

"He's full-go," Arians said. "He's almost 100 percent. He's doing everything. It's amazing."

Despite turning 44 in August, Brady has dedicated himself to rigorous workouts and organized team activities. His determination and enthusiasm have surprised many, including Arians.

"I didn't think he'd be cleared to do everything," Arians admitted. "But he's cleared to do everything."

Arians acknowledged the challenge in managing Brady's practice time, given his eagerness to participate. "He wants to do everything," Arians said. "We've got to hold him back a little bit."

Brady's impressive performance in practice has raised expectations for his upcoming season. After leading the Buccaneers to their first Super Bowl title in 18 years, Brady is poised to build on his success.

"He's got a great understanding of the offense now," Arians said. "He's in Year 2, so he's going to be that much better."

Receiver Chris Godwin echoed Arians' sentiments, noting the improved timing and understanding between Brady and the receivers. "The timing is a lot better," Godwin said. "He knows where we're going to be, and we know where he's going to put the ball."

Brady's increased comfort and familiarity with the offensive system could make him and his receivers even more dangerous in the upcoming season. With a full offseason to prepare, Brady is expected to continue his dominance and lead the Buccaneers to another successful campaign.

"He's the GOAT for a reason," Godwin said. "He's always going to be great."
