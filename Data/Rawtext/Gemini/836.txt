Tiger Woods' Crash: New Details Emerge, Raising Questions About Consciousness

Los Angeles, CA - Tiger Woods was mistakenly under the impression that he was in Florida when interviewed by a hospital staff member following his February car crash in Los Angeles, according to a newly released crash report.

The report, obtained by USA TODAY, provides a detailed account of the events leading up to and following the single-vehicle rollover that left Woods with severe leg injuries.

Low Blood Pressure, Empty Pharmaceutical Bottle

After the crash, Woods' blood pressure was too low to administer pain medication, the report states. An empty pharmaceutical bottle was also found at the crash scene, but investigators have not yet determined what was in the bottle.

Vehicle Data Raises Questions

Vehicle data indicates that Woods was going straight with no steering input detected until late in the crash sequence, according to Sergeant Michael Downing, author of the data report. This suggests that Woods may have been unconscious at the time of the crash.

Speeding, No Braking or Steering

Woods was traveling over 82 mph in a 45-mph zone and applied the gas pedal at 99% just before the crash, the report states. There was no evidence of braking or steering to avoid the crash.

"It's clear that Woods was driving at a speed unsafe for the road conditions and was unable to negotiate the curve," said Jonathan Cherney, a former police detective and forensic crash reconstruction expert.

No Evidence of Impairment

Investigators found no reason to believe that Woods was impaired by alcohol or drugs at the time of the crash, according to Officer Justin Smith, who investigated the incident.

'Somewhat Combative' Post-Crash

Woods was described as "somewhat combative" post-crash, according to Deputy Kyle Sullivan, who interviewed Woods. Sheriff Alex Villanueva attributed this behavior to the trauma and shock from Woods' injuries.

History of Driving Incidents

This is Woods' third driving incident since 2009. In 2009, he was cited for careless driving after crashing his SUV into a fire hydrant and a tree. In 2017, he was arrested for DUI after being found asleep at the wheel of his car.

Questions Remain

The crash report raises several questions about Woods' consciousness at the time of the crash. Investigators are still working to determine what was in the empty pharmaceutical bottle found at the scene.

"It's possible that Woods experienced a medical episode that caused him to lose consciousness," said Cherney. "However, we need more information to confirm this."

Woods is currently recovering from his injuries and has not yet commented on the crash.
