Teen Charged with Murder, Terrorism in Michigan School Shooting

OXFORD TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) – A 15-year-old boy was charged with murder and terrorism Tuesday after a shooting at Oxford High School in Michigan that killed four students and injured seven others.

Ethan Crumbley was arraigned on 24 charges, including four counts of first-degree murder, seven counts of assault with intent to murder, and one count of terrorism causing death. He was charged as an adult and a not guilty plea was entered on his behalf.

Prosecutor Karen McDonald said the shooting was premeditated, citing a video Crumbley recorded on his phone the night before discussing plans to kill students.

"He methodically and deliberately planned and carried out his attack," McDonald said. "He recorded himself talking about his plans to shoot up the school and kill students."

Sheriff's Lt. Tim Willis said Crumbley purchased the 9 mm Sig Sauer gun used in the shooting from his father just a week prior.

"The gun was purchased legally by the father, but it was unsecured and accessible to the son," Willis said.

The incident occurred hours after a concerning meeting between Crumbley's parents and school officials about his behavior. School officials had noticed disturbing drawings and writings in Crumbley's notebook, including references to killing and blood.

"We had a meeting with the parents and the student, and we expressed our concerns about his behavior," said Oxford Community Schools Superintendent Tim Throne. "We asked them to get him into counseling, but they refused."

Crumbley's father, James Crumbley, purchased the gun on Black Friday, November 26. He posted a photo of the gun on social media, writing, "Just got my son a new Christmas present."

Jennifer Crumbley, Ethan's mother, previously wrote an open letter to Donald Trump, discussing her son's struggles, her financial sacrifices, and her support for gun rights.

"I'm a single mother working two jobs to support my family," she wrote. "I've sacrificed everything for my son, and I don't want to see him taken away from me."

Prosecutor McDonald said she is considering charges against Crumbley's parents for failing to secure the firearm.

"Parents have a responsibility to keep their children safe, and that includes keeping guns out of their reach," McDonald said.

The terrorism charge was emphasized due to the broader impact on students, families, and the community.

"This was not just an isolated incident," said Assistant Prosecutor Marc Keast. "This was an act of terrorism that has traumatized an entire community."

Authorities highlighted the importance of reporting threats to officials and cautioned against spreading rumors on social media.

"If you see something, say something," said Sheriff Mike Bouchard. "Don't be afraid to report suspicious behavior to the authorities."

The shooting was the deadliest school shooting in the U.S. since Santa Fe High School in 2018, marking it among 31 mass killings in the year.

Defense attorney Scott Kozak said he is still reviewing the evidence and declined to comment on the charges.

"We need to let the legal process play out," Kozak said. "We will have more to say at a later time."

The arraignment was held virtually, with Crumbley appearing from the Oakland County Jail. He was ordered held without bond.

A probable cause conference is scheduled for December 13, and a preliminary examination is scheduled for December 20.
