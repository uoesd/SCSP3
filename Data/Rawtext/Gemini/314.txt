QAnon's Bizarre Suez Canal Conspiracy: Hillary Clinton, Child Sex Slaves, and a Birthing Canal

In the wake of the Ever Given's historic blockage of the Suez Canal, a bizarre and unfounded conspiracy theory has emerged among QAnon supporters, alleging that the ship was operated by Hillary Clinton and carried child sex slaves.

The theory, which has proliferated on platforms like Telegram and Gab, links the ship's Taiwanese operator, Evergreen, to Clinton's secret service name, "Evergreen," and its call sign, "H3RC," to Clinton's initials.

"These are the kinds of connections that QAnon followers are making," said Daniel Funke, an expert in online misinformation at PolitiFact. "They're taking these very superficial similarities and using them to build a narrative that fits their existing beliefs."

PolitiFact has debunked the theory, confirming that there is no evidence linking the ship to Clinton or human trafficking. However, QAnon followers have continued to develop more intricate and baseless theories.

One theory suggests that the ship's captain, an Indian national, is a "deep state" operative who deliberately grounded the ship to block the canal. Another claims that the ship's pre-canal course, when viewed on a map, resembles a crude drawing of a penis, indicating a phallic symbol of power.

A spokesperson for vesselfinder.com, a website that tracks ship movements, confirmed the accuracy of the ship's tracking data, dismissing the conspiracy theories.

"The data we have shows that the Ever Given was not hacked and that its course was not manipulated," the spokesperson said.

Despite the lack of evidence, QAnon followers have clung to the theory, suggesting that the ship's computers were hacked by those supportive of the QAnon cause, framing the incident as part of a larger plan to expose the "deep state."

The Suez Canal has also taken on symbolic significance in QAnon theories, with some suggesting that it represents a "birthing canal," indicating a forthcoming revelation against the deep state.

"The Suez Canal is a major waterway that connects the East and the West," said Funke. "For QAnon followers, it's a symbol of the globalist cabal that they believe is controlling the world."

Old QAnon posts mentioning to "watch the water" have been reused as alleged proofs of the conspiracy's validity. One elaborate "proof" board on a QAnon message board connected unconnected facts about the ship, such as its weight and dimensions, to QAnon prophecies.

"These theories are a way for QAnon followers to make sense of a complex and confusing world," said Funke. "They provide a simple explanation for events that they don't understand, and they reinforce the sense of community and belonging that QAnon provides."

Despite the lack of evidence and the debunking by fact-checking organizations, the QAnon conspiracy theory about the Ever Given ship continues to spread, fueled by the echo chamber of social media platforms and the desire for a simple explanation in a complex world.
