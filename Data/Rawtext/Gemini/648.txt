Racine Man Pleads Not Guilty in Rittenhouse Gun Case

Racine, Wis. – Dominick Black, 19, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges of providing Kyle Rittenhouse, then 17, with an AR-15-style rifle that was used in the fatal shootings of two protesters in Kenosha in August.

Black faces two counts of providing a dangerous weapon to someone under 18, resulting in death, with each count potentially carrying a three-year prison sentence.

Black's attorney, Anthony Cotton, filed a motion to dismiss the charges, claiming a misinterpretation of the law.

"The statute is very clear that it does not apply to this case," Cotton said. "The rifle was purchased for Rittenhouse to use on private property and was stored in Kenosha by Black's stepfather."

Rittenhouse used the rifle on August 25, 2020, to fatally shoot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wound Gaige Grosskreutz, 27. Rittenhouse claimed self-defense and was acquitted of all charges in November 2021.

Wisconsin law prohibits adults from providing firearms to minors, with certain exceptions for supervised activities, such as hunting or target shooting.

Cotton argues that the law's exceptions and specifications do not apply because Rittenhouse was not hunting.

"The statute is very specific," Cotton said. "It says that it does not apply to the transfer of a firearm to a minor for the purpose of hunting."

A separate motion by Cotton challenges the charging of two counts for the same weapon transfer, citing double jeopardy concerns.

"The state is trying to punish Mr. Black twice for the same offense," Cotton said. "This is a clear violation of his constitutional rights."

Judge Bruce Schroeder indicated agreement on the multiplicity issue and said he would likely issue a ruling in writing by June.

Federal authorities are also considering charges against Black for straw purchasing the rifle, which could carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.

Background

On August 25, 2020, Rittenhouse, then 17, traveled from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha, Wisconsin, to attend a protest against the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-15-style rifle that had been purchased for him by Black.

During the protest, Rittenhouse shot and killed Rosenbaum and Huber, and wounded Grosskreutz. Rittenhouse claimed self-defense, saying that he fired his rifle only after he was attacked by the three men.

Rittenhouse was arrested and charged with multiple felonies, including first-degree intentional homicide. He was acquitted of all charges in November 2021.

Legal Analysis

The legal issues in the Black case are complex and involve the interpretation of Wisconsin's firearm laws.

The statute that Black is charged under, Wis. Stat. 948.60(2)(a), prohibits adults from providing firearms to minors, with certain exceptions. One of the exceptions is for the transfer of a firearm to a minor for the purpose of hunting.

Cotton argues that the exception applies in this case because Rittenhouse was planning to use the rifle to hunt on private property. The state, however, argues that the exception does not apply because Rittenhouse was not actually hunting at the time he received the rifle.

The court will need to decide whether the exception applies in this case. If the court finds that the exception does not apply, Black could be convicted of providing a dangerous weapon to a minor, resulting in death.

Conclusion

The Black case is a high-profile case that is being closely watched by legal experts. The outcome of the case could have implications for the interpretation of Wisconsin's firearm laws.
