Twitter Locks Chinese Embassy Account for Dehumanizing Uighur Women

Twitter has suspended the account of the Chinese Embassy in the United States for violating its dehumanization policy. The move comes after the embassy tweeted a claim that Uighur women were no longer "baby making machines," citing a state-backed newspaper study.

"The tweet violated our policy against dehumanization," a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement. "As such, the account has been locked and the tweet has been removed."

The embassy has not posted on Twitter since January 9, and it is unclear when the account will be unlocked. Twitter requires accounts that violate its policies to manually delete the offending tweets, but the embassy has not done so.

The suspension of the embassy's account follows a similar move by Twitter against former U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump's account was permanently suspended in January 2021 due to the risk of violence.

The Chinese Embassy's tweet referred to a study published in the state-backed Global Times newspaper, which claimed that Uighur women were no longer "baby making machines" due to China's birth control policies. The study was widely criticized by human rights groups, who accused China of using forced sterilization and abortion against Uighurs.

China has denied these allegations, but a UN panel has reported that at least one million Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang. German researcher Adrian Zenz has also accused China of using forced sterilization and abortion against Uighurs.

In one of his final acts as Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo declared China's actions in Xinjiang as "genocide." President Joe Biden's Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has also shared Pompeo's view on China's policies in Xinjiang.

"The Chinese government is committing genocide against the Uighurs," Pompeo said in January 2021. "This is a crime against humanity that cannot be tolerated."

"We stand with the Uighurs and all those who are suffering under the Chinese government's brutal repression," Blinken said in February 2021.

China has sanctioned Pompeo and 27 other Trump administration officials, barring them and their families from entering China.

The Canadian House of Commons subcommittee on international human rights concluded in February 2021 that the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang amounts to genocide. China has refuted this conclusion.

The suspension of the Chinese Embassy's Twitter account is the latest sign of the escalating tensions between the United States and China over human rights issues. The two countries have also clashed over trade, technology, and the South China Sea.
