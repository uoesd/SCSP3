UN Chief Condemns 'Horrific' Attack on Kunduz Mosque in Afghanistan

United Nations, New York - United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has strongly condemned the "horrific" attack on a mosque in Kunduz, Afghanistan, which killed and injured more than 100 people.

The attack, which took place on Friday during Friday prayers, is the third on a religious institution in Afghanistan in less than a week.

"This heinous attack is a violation of human rights and international humanitarian law," Guterres said in a statement. "I call for the perpetrators to be brought to justice and express my deepest condolences to the families of the victims."

The Islamic State Khorasan Province (IKSP), an extremist Islamist faction, has claimed responsibility for the attack. IKSP has targeted the Shia Muslim community in the past and is opposed to the Taliban.

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has noted a "disturbing pattern of violence" with recent attacks on mosques and a school.

"These attacks are a reminder of the ongoing threat of terrorism in Afghanistan and the need for all parties to work together to bring peace and stability to the country," said Deborah Lyons, the UN Special Representative for Afghanistan.

The UN Security Council also condemned the attack in a statement, underscoring the need to hold perpetrators accountable.

"Terrorism constitutes a grave threat to international peace and security," the Council said. "The members of the Security Council reaffirm that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security."

The Council also expressed its condolences to the families of the victims and wished a speedy recovery to those injured.

The attack on the Kunduz mosque comes as Afghanistan faces a humanitarian crisis, with millions of people facing hunger and displacement. The UN has called for urgent international action to address the crisis.
