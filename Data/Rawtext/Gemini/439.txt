Royals Visit Afghan Refugees at Task Force Liberty

Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, visited Task Force Liberty at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey on Wednesday, meeting with Afghan refugees and engaging with children in daily schooling.

The base currently houses over 10,000 Afghan refugees who have recently arrived in the United States. Harry and Meghan spent time speaking to women and children, listening to their stories and offering support.

They joined children in a classroom teaching conversational English, interacting with them using simple phrases and learning common terms in Dari. The couple led the children in singing "Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes," sharing that it's a favorite song of their son, Archie.

"It was wonderful to see how the children have settled in and are learning so quickly," said Meghan. "They are a testament to the resilience of the Afghan people."

Harry and Meghan also thanked the teachers for their efforts and emphasized the importance of self-care and mental health. "It's crucial to take care of your own well-being so that you can be there for others," said Harry.

SSgt Jake Carter of Task Force Liberty Public Affairs documented the visit, capturing the heartwarming interactions between the couple and the refugees.

The visit highlights Harry and Meghan's ongoing mental health advocacy. They have previously spoken out about the importance of seeking help and breaking down the stigma surrounding mental health issues.

Task Force Liberty was initiated coinciding with the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. Its mission is to support Afghan refugees by providing housing, medical care, and other essential services.

"We are grateful to Prince Harry and Meghan for taking the time to visit Task Force Liberty and meet with our Afghan guests," said Col. Patrick Costello, commander of Task Force Liberty. "Their visit sends a powerful message of support and compassion."

The visit underscores the ongoing efforts to support Afghan refugees as they adjust to their new lives in the United States. Harry and Meghan's presence serves as a reminder of the importance of empathy, kindness, and the power of human connection in times of adversity.
