Capitol Police Command Collapsed During Riot, Leaving Officers to Fend for Themselves

WASHINGTON (AP) – The U.S. Capitol Police command structure collapsed during the Jan. 6 riot, leaving officers to fend for themselves without leadership or a plan as a mob of Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building, according to a scathing new report by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

The report, released Tuesday, found that Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who resigned following the riot, was with Vice President Mike Pence and uncommunicative during the event. Interim Chief Yogananda Pittman and Lt. Tarik Johnson provided limited instructions, complicating the response to the mob.

"The lack of effective command and control contributed to the failure of the Capitol Police to effectively respond to the attack," the report concluded.

The report also found that the Capitol Police had rejected offers of external support from other law enforcement agencies, including the National Guard, despite previous online warnings of unrest. The Capitol Police had only planned for a free speech demonstration, not the violent attack that unfolded.

The riot resulted in five deaths, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick and another officer's subsequent suicide. Federal agencies are reviewing the coordination and response failures that made the Capitol vulnerable.

Confusion over National Guard Request

There was confusion over whether the National Guard was requested, with differing accounts from police and congressional leaders. The report found that the Capitol Police did not formally request the National Guard until 1:09 p.m. on Jan. 6, more than an hour after the riot began.

However, the report also found that the Capitol Police had been in discussions with the National Guard about potential support in the days leading up to Jan. 6. The report said that the Capitol Police had rejected an offer of assistance from the National Guard on Jan. 5, but that the National Guard had been placed on standby.

Inadequate Preparation and Briefing

The report also found that the Capitol Police lacked an adequate preparation and briefing process for the Jan. 6 event, unlike for other major events. The report said that the Capitol Police had not conducted a full-scale exercise for a riot or other large-scale security threat in several years.

Officers Inadequately Warned

The report also found that officers were inadequately warned about the scale of the threat from rioters, many of whom were better armed than the police. The report said that the Capitol Police had received intelligence reports warning of potential violence, but that this information was not widely disseminated to officers.

Most Rioters Left Without Arrest

The report also found that most rioters left the Capitol without being arrested. The report said that this was due to the overwhelming number of rioters compared to police. The report said that the Capitol Police had only about 1,200 officers on duty on Jan. 6, while the mob numbered in the thousands.

Recommendations

The report made a number of recommendations to improve the Capitol Police's response to future threats, including:

  • Establishing a clear chain of command and ensuring that all officers know who is in charge.
  • Developing a comprehensive plan for responding to large-scale security threats.
  • Conducting regular exercises to test the plan and identify areas for improvement.
  • Providing officers with adequate training and equipment.
  • Improving intelligence sharing with other law enforcement agencies.

The report also recommended that Congress provide the Capitol Police with additional funding and resources to improve its security posture.

Reaction

The Capitol Police said in a statement that it is "committed to implementing the recommendations of the report." The statement said that the Capitol Police has already taken steps to improve its security posture, including hiring additional officers and increasing training.

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee said in a statement that it will continue to oversee the Capitol Police's implementation of the report's recommendations. The statement said that the committee will also hold hearings to examine the broader security failures that led to the Jan. 6 riot.
