Hurricane Ida Exposes Fragility of Louisiana's Electric Grid

Sept 4 (Reuters) – Hurricane Ida's devastating winds left over 1 million Louisiana customers without power, casting a spotlight on the resilience of the state's electric grid and the preparedness of its largest utility, Entergy Corp.

The Category 4 storm's 150-mph winds toppled transmission towers and snapped power lines, causing widespread outages that lingered for days. Entergy, which serves over 1.1 million customers in Louisiana, faced scrutiny over its storm preparations and the effectiveness of its infrastructure upgrades.

"We've been working for years to make our system more resilient," said Rod West, Entergy's group president of utility operations. "But when you have a storm of this magnitude, there's going to be damage."

From 2017 to 2019, Entergy spent about $1.2 billion on transmission system improvements, including replacing aging infrastructure and installing stronger poles and towers. However, the effectiveness of these upgrades against Ida's fury is now being questioned.

"The question is, were those investments enough?" said Praveen Malhotra, an engineer and expert on catastrophe risk. "It's clear that some of the infrastructure failed, so we need to look at what went wrong."

Entergy's transmission network consists of a mix of infrastructure with varying wind resistance ratings, reflecting the utility's gradual approach to upgrading its system. About one-sixth of Entergy Louisiana's transmission system can only withstand wind speeds of up to 95 mph, well below Ida's peak gusts.

"We have a lot of legacy infrastructure that we're working to replace," said Michelle Bourg, vice president of Entergy Louisiana. "But it's a slow and expensive process."

Entergy has requested regulator approval for over $500 million to repair and rebuild transmission lines damaged in 2020 hurricanes. The utility argues that these investments are necessary to improve the resilience of the grid.

"We're committed to making our system more resilient," said Phillip May, chief executive of Entergy Louisiana LLC. "We're going to learn from this storm and make the necessary investments to protect our customers from future events."

However, some experts argue that Entergy's efforts have fallen short.

"Entergy has not invested enough in hardening its infrastructure," said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy. "They've been focused on short-term profits instead of long-term resilience."

Eric Smith, associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute, agrees.

"Entergy's infrastructure is not up to the task of withstanding these increasingly severe storms," he said. "We need to see a major investment in modernization and fortification."

Recent storms have focused damage on Entergy's older infrastructure, while newer structures have largely withstood the impacts. This suggests that the utility's recent investments have been effective in improving the resilience of its system.

Entergy is also investing in local generation capacity to address transmission constraints due to New Orleans' geographic limitations. The utility is building a new natural gas-fired power plant in New Orleans East and is exploring the development of offshore wind farms.

"We're taking a comprehensive approach to improving the resilience of our system," said West. "We're investing in new infrastructure, new generation, and new technologies."

Experts predict that U.S. utilities will need to invest $500 billion to modernize and fortify infrastructure against more frequent severe weather events.

"The cost of inaction is too high," said Malhotra. "We need to make these investments now to protect our communities from future storms."
