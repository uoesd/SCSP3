UK's Kabul Evacuation Nears End as Deadline Looms

The United Kingdom's evacuation operation from Kabul airport is entering its final stages as the August 31 deadline set by the United States approaches. Despite the UK government's efforts to persuade the US to extend the deadline, the Americans have remained firm in their decision.

The evacuation has been marred by two explosions at the airport that killed 90 people, including 13 US service members. However, the UK has maintained its pace of withdrawal, with over 13,000 people evacuated so far.

The UK's ability to continue operating Kabul airport without the US is limited due to a lack of sufficient troops, air traffic control, intelligence, surveillance, and air protection. As Nick Reynolds of the Royal United Services Institute think tank explained, "The UK does not have the capability to maintain the airport without the US. We don't have enough troops, we don't have the air traffic control, we don't have the intelligence, we don't have the surveillance, and we don't have the air protection."

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the unique capabilities of the US in managing a mission of this scale and complexity. "Only the United States has the capacity to manage an evacuation of this size and complexity, with thousands of American citizens, tens of thousands of Afghans, and nationals from over 100 countries," Blinken said.

The evacuation has involved around 6,000 US troops and over 1,000 UK troops, along with troops from other NATO countries. The UK has acknowledged that not everyone eligible for evacuation will be able to leave before the deadline.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has indicated that the UK is loosening passenger number limits on flights to maximize evacuations, even if it means leaving some military equipment behind. "We have to make sure that we get as many people out as possible," Wallace said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested a "second phase" for further evacuations after the US withdrawal, based on a "reasonable approach" with the Taliban. "We will continue to do everything we can to get people out," Johnson said.

However, President Joe Biden has insisted on leaving by August 31, stating that the Taliban's "self-interest" will be to maintain security around the airport perimeter. "We will continue to evacuate as many people as we can until the end," Biden said. "But we will not stay forever."

The UK's evacuation efforts have been praised for their efficiency and professionalism, but the looming deadline has raised concerns about the fate of those who will be left behind. The government has pledged to continue working with international partners to support the Afghan people and ensure their safety.
