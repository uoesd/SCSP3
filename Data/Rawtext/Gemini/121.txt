Lemon and Cuomo Launch Podcast, Exploring Off-Camera Friendship and News Insights

New York CNN – Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo, former CNN anchors, have embarked on a new venture together: a podcast titled "The Handoff." The podcast delves into their off-camera friendship and offers unfiltered perspectives on the week's news.

The name "The Handoff" is inspired by the nightly transition between Cuomo's "Cuomo Prime Time" and Lemon's "Don Lemon Tonight." Cuomo remarked on the spontaneity and originality of their on-camera handoff, which has never been formally produced.

"It's just us," Cuomo said. "It's not scripted. It's not rehearsed. It's just two guys who are friends."

Both hosts emphasized the authenticity of their friendship, which they believe sets it apart from typical media relationships.

"We're not just colleagues," Lemon said. "We're friends. We hang out outside of work. We talk about our families. We talk about our lives."

Lemon highlighted the diversity in his and Cuomo's friendships outside of work, noting that they have friends from different backgrounds and walks of life.

"Our friendship is not just about work," Lemon said. "It's about life."

Cuomo echoed Lemon's sentiments, valuing their extensive off-air time together.

"We spend a lot of time together off the air," Cuomo said. "We go to dinner. We go to the movies. We talk on the phone. We text each other."

Amidst the current political turmoil, both Lemon and Cuomo see their interactions as a notable period in their careers.

"We're living in a very interesting time," Lemon said. "There's a lot of division in the country. There's a lot of anger. But I think it's important to have conversations with people who you disagree with."

Cuomo agreed, noting that their friendship allows them to have open and honest discussions about important issues.

"We don't always agree on everything," Cuomo said. "But we respect each other's opinions. And we're always willing to listen to each other's perspectives."

Both hosts cherish the unpredictability and genuine nature of their on-screen exchanges.

"You never know what's going to happen when we're on the air together," Lemon said. "That's what makes it so fun."

Cuomo added, "We're not afraid to be ourselves. We're not afraid to show our emotions. We're not afraid to laugh at ourselves."

The conversation concluded with a mutual expression of love, underscoring the depth of their bond.

"I love Chris," Lemon said. "He's my brother."

"I love Don too," Cuomo replied. "He's my best friend."
