Kamala Harris Sworn In as Vice President, Making History

Washington, D.C. - Kamala Harris was sworn in as the 49th vice president of the United States on Wednesday, making history as the first woman, first Black person, and first Asian American to hold the office.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first woman of color on the Supreme Court, administered the oath to Harris, who used two Bibles for the ceremony. One belonged to family friend Regina Shelton, and the other was once owned by the late Justice Thurgood Marshall.

"It is with great honor and humility that I stand before you today," Harris said after taking the oath. "I am mindful of the extraordinary moment that we are in, and the work that lies ahead."

Harris's swearing-in was a particularly significant moment for her, as she reflected on her mother and the people counting on their leadership.

"My mother taught me that service to others is the best way to live a meaningful life," Harris said. "And I know that the work we do here will make a difference in the lives of people across our country."

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) highlighted the significance of Harris's role for children worldwide, showing them that "anything and everything is possible."

The vice presidential oath, shared with that taken by members of Congress, focuses on defending the Constitution and faithfully discharging the duties of the office.

Harris is also the first graduate of a historically Black college and the first member of a Black sorority to become vice president.

"This is a day of celebration and a day of reflection," Harris said. "We have come a long way, but we still have much work to do."

The ceremony employed Bibles with personal and historical significance, highlighting both personal journeys and broader social progress.

"This is a historic day for our country," Sotomayor said. "It is a day that we will remember for generations to come."
