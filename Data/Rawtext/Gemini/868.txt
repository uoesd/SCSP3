Tiger Woods' Recovery Fueled by Love for Children, Determination

Golf legend Tiger Woods continues his arduous recovery journey from a devastating car accident in February, driven by an unwavering love for his children and an indomitable spirit.

The crash left Woods with severe injuries to his right leg, including open fractures. Investigations revealed he was speeding at 87 mph, over 45 mph above the legal limit, before the accident.

Despite the setbacks, Woods has shown remarkable progress in recent weeks. He was spotted without crutches for the first time since the crash at his son Charlie's golf tournament.

"He's very motivated by his kids," said a source close to Woods. "Charlie and Sam are his everything."

Woods' physical therapy has been a cornerstone of his recovery. "He's feeling stronger and more capable each day," the source added. "He's been working hard and it's paying off."

While there's no confirmed return date, Woods reportedly has a timeframe in mind for his comeback. "He's not rushing anything, but he's definitely eager to get back out there," the source said.

Woods' last PGA Tour competition was at the Masters in November 2020. His absence has been keenly felt by fans and fellow golfers alike.

"Tiger is a true champion," said Rory McIlroy. "He's overcome so much in his career, and I know he'll come back stronger than ever."

Woods' determination is fueled by his love for his children. "They're his inspiration," the source said. "He wants to be there for them and give them the best life possible."

As Woods continues his recovery, his unwavering spirit and the love of his family serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration.
