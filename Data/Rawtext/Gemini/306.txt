Ever Given Refloated, Suez Canal Traffic Resumes After Six-Day Blockage

Suez, Egypt - The colossal Ever Given container ship, which had been wedged sideways in the Suez Canal for six days, was successfully refloated on Monday, ending a major disruption to global trade.

The massive salvage operation, involving a fleet of powerful tugboats, large-capacity dredgers, and high tides, culminated in the freeing of the 1,312-foot-long vessel, almost as tall as the Empire State Building.

Dredging and Tugging to the Rescue

Over the past week, salvage crews worked tirelessly to remove 30,000 cubic meters of sand from around the ship's hull, equivalent to about a dozen Olympic-sized swimming pools. This monumental effort was aided by the arrival of two specialized dredgers, the 10th of Ramadan and the Mashhour, which played a pivotal role in dislodging the ship.

Simultaneously, a team of 14 tugboats, taking advantage of high tides caused by a full moon, applied immense force to pull the Ever Given free. The combined efforts of these vessels gradually shifted the ship, allowing it to be towed to a nearby anchorage area.

A Global Economic Lifeline Restored

The blockage of the Suez Canal, a vital artery for global trade, had caused a massive backlog of over 300 ships waiting to pass through. The Suez Canal Authority chairman estimated the daily disruption cost at a staggering $15 billion.

With the Ever Given now freed, the backlog is expected to be cleared gradually, although estimates on the timeframe vary from three to more than ten days. Over 130 additional vessels are already en route to the canal, adding to the congestion.

A Complex and Delicate Operation

The refloating operation was a complex and delicate undertaking, requiring precise coordination and specialized equipment. In addition to the dredgers and tugboats, conventional earthmoving equipment was also employed to remove sand from around the ship's hull.

The successful refloating of the Ever Given is a testament to the skill and determination of the salvage crews involved. It also highlights the critical importance of the Suez Canal as a global trade route and the potential economic consequences of its disruption.
