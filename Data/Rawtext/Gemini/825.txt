Cruz's Claim on Illegal Immigrants Receiving Stimulus Checks Debunked

Senator Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) amendment to the American Rescue Plan, which sought to prevent illegal immigrants from receiving $1,400 stimulus checks, was rejected after facing opposition from Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who argued that the claim was false.

Cruz asserted that illegal immigrants with Social Security numbers, such as those who overstayed visas, would receive stimulus checks under the plan. However, the American Rescue Plan allows anyone paying taxes in the U.S. as a resident, including non-citizens with Social Security numbers, to be eligible for stimulus payments.

Unauthorized immigrants are defined as foreign-born non-citizens living in the U.S. without legal residence. Visa overstayers, who remain in the country beyond the expiration of their visas, retain their Social Security numbers, making them potentially eligible for stimulus checks if they pay taxes.

In 2019, there were 676,422 visa overstays, with student visas showing the highest overstay rate. A spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that overstaying a visa technically renders someone illegal.

However, Durbin's aide criticized the assumption that all visa overstayers have Social Security numbers eligible for stimulus checks. He highlighted that such conditions apply to previous stimulus packages as well.

"The vast majority of undocumented immigrants do not have Social Security numbers," Durbin's aide said. "This is a red herring."

Legal permanent residents and those passing the substantial presence test qualify as legal residents and are eligible for the stimulus payment.

Cruz's Amendment Rejected

Cruz's amendment was rejected by a vote of 92-6. Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, argued that the amendment was "unnecessary" and "discriminatory."

"This amendment is not about protecting American taxpayers," Durbin said. "It's about scapegoating immigrants."

Cruz defended his amendment, arguing that it was necessary to prevent illegal immigrants from receiving stimulus checks.

"We should not be sending stimulus checks to people who are here illegally," Cruz said.

Overstaying Visas

Overstaying a visa is a civil offense, not a criminal one. However, it can have serious consequences, including deportation and ineligibility for future visas.

The Trump administration took a hard line on visa overstays, increasing enforcement and making it more difficult for overstayers to obtain legal status.

The Biden administration has taken a more lenient approach, focusing on deporting those who pose a threat to public safety or national security.

Conclusion

Senator Cruz's claim that illegal immigrants would receive stimulus checks under the American Rescue Plan was false. The plan only allows those paying taxes in the U.S. as residents, including non-citizens with Social Security numbers, to be eligible for stimulus payments.

Cruz's amendment to prevent illegal immigrants from receiving stimulus checks was rejected by the Senate. The amendment was unnecessary and discriminatory, according to Senator Durbin.
