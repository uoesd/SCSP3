Missing White Woman Syndrome: A Persistent Bias in Media Coverage

The tragic case of Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old white woman who went missing during a cross-country road trip with her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, has garnered intense media attention. CNN anchor Chris Cuomo has been among those emphasizing the importance of finding Laundrie, saying, "We need to find Brian Laundrie. We need to know what happened."

While Petito's case has received widespread coverage, it has also reignited discussions on "missing white woman syndrome," a term that highlights the media's disproportionate focus on white victims, often neglecting victims of color.

"It's a real phenomenon," said Brent Blue, the coroner in Petito's case. "We see it all the time. Missing white women get more attention than missing women of color."

Carol Liebler, a professor at Syracuse University, has studied the issue extensively. "There's a long history of this pattern in media storytelling," she said. "White female victims are seen as more sympathetic and deserving of attention."

Studies confirm this bias. A 2020 report by the National Crime Information Center found that missing white individuals receive more and often more favorable media coverage than people of color.

Various factors contribute to this syndrome, including racial biases and a lack of newsroom diversity. "Newsrooms are still predominantly white," said Lynnette Grey Bull, founder of a group advocating for missing and trafficked Native Americans. "That means they're more likely to prioritize stories that resonate with their own experiences."

Social media and public engagement can challenge these biases by amplifying neglected cases. "We're seeing more and more people using social media to raise awareness about missing people of color," said Grey Bull. "That's helping to put pressure on the media to do better."

The recent coverage of Petito's case might indicate a shift toward more inclusive reporting on missing persons. "I think the public is becoming more aware of this issue," said Liebler. "That's putting pressure on journalists to be more mindful of their coverage."

However, experts argue that without lasting changes in newsroom practices, the pattern of biased coverage is likely to recur. "We need to see more diversity in newsrooms," said Grey Bull. "We need to see more training on implicit bias. And we need to see more accountability from media outlets."

Until these changes are made, the media will continue to perpetuate the harmful narrative of missing white woman syndrome, leaving countless victims of color forgotten and ignored.
