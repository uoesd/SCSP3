QAnon Exploits Facebook Outage to Fuel Mass Arrest Conspiracy

On October 4, 2021, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp experienced a major outage that lasted for approximately six hours, affecting billions of users worldwide. The outage sparked a flurry of speculation, including among QAnon conspiracy theorists who saw it as a sign of their predicted "Blackout" event.

Facebook attributed the outage to internal system issues and assured users that no data had been compromised. However, QAnon followers seized upon the incident to advance their theories of a global cabal of elites being arrested en masse.

"The Blackout is here," wrote John Sabal, known as QAnon John on Telegram. "The internet is going down. The arrests are happening."

Sabal pointed to a 4Chan post that appeared minutes after the Facebook platforms went offline, hinting at a coming global internet outage. Newsweek reported on the post, which has since been deleted.

Ron Watkins, another prominent QAnon figure, suggested the outage could be linked to Facebook's reaction to whistleblower Frances Haugen's allegations about the company's harmful effects on users.

"Facebook is down because they are trying to cover up the truth," Watkins wrote on Telegram. "The Blackout is coming."

Sabal and Watkins, who have substantial Telegram followings, are scheduled to attend the "For God and Country: Patriot Double Down" convention in Dallas, Texas, on October 29-31. The convention is expected to host QAnon followers and Republican politicians who dispute the results of the 2020 Presidential Election.

The Facebook outage had a significant impact on the company's stock value, which dropped by roughly 4.9 percent, erasing about $40 billion from its market cap. The outage also highlighted the growing influence of QAnon conspiracy theories, which have gained traction among far-right groups and continue to spread misinformation and sow division.

"The QAnon movement is a dangerous and destructive force," said Mike Rothschild, a researcher who tracks QAnon activity. "Their theories are baseless and have no basis in reality, but they can have real-world consequences."

The Facebook outage has provided QAnon followers with a new opportunity to spread their message and recruit new members. It is crucial for social media companies and the public to remain vigilant against the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories that can undermine trust and harm society.
