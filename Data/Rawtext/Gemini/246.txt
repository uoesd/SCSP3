Biden Administration Unveils Sweeping COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates for Employers, Federal Contractors, and Workers

In a bold move to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden has announced a series of comprehensive vaccine mandates for U.S. employers, federal contractors, and federal workers. These mandates, which will be implemented through a combination of executive orders and regulations, aim to significantly increase vaccination rates and protect the health and safety of the American workforce.

OSHA to Issue Emergency Temporary Standard for Private Employers

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will develop an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) requiring employers with 100 or more employees to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for their employees or provide weekly testing. This ETS will be issued without a notice-and-comment period and will take effect immediately upon publication.

Employers subject to this ETS must provide paid time off for employees to get vaccinated and recover from any side effects. The ETS does not require employers to pay for testing, but it does allow employers to offer testing at no cost to employees.

Legal Challenges Anticipated

Legal challenges to the OSHA ETS are anticipated, particularly concerning the rule's wage-payment requirement and coverage of workers who recently recovered from COVID-19. Some employers may argue that the ETS is an overreach of OSHA's authority and that the wage-payment requirement is a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Vaccine Mandates for Federal Contractors and Workers

Separate executive orders mandate vaccinations for employees of federal contractors and all federal workers, with minimal exceptions. Federal contractors must comply with vaccine mandates as detailed by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force by September 24.

Legal challenges to the federal contractor executive order may test presidential authority under the Procurement Act. The executive order could be challenged on the grounds that it exceeds the president's authority to set procurement policies.

All Federal Executive Branch Workers Required to be Vaccinated

All federal executive branch workers are required to be vaccinated, with only legally required exceptions permitted. This mandate applies to all employees of the executive branch, including the White House, cabinet agencies, and independent agencies.

CMS Mandates Vaccinations for Health Care Workers

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will require COVID-19 vaccinations for workers in most health care settings that receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. This mandate applies to hospitals, nursing homes, dialysis centers, and other health care facilities.

Impact on Businesses and the Economy

The vaccine mandates are expected to have a significant impact on businesses and the economy. Some businesses may face challenges in implementing the mandates, particularly those with large numbers of unvaccinated employees. The mandates may also lead to increased labor costs for employers who choose to provide paid time off for vaccinations and testing.

Public Health Implications

The vaccine mandates are expected to have a positive impact on public health by increasing vaccination rates and reducing the spread of COVID-19. The mandates are also likely to reduce the number of hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19.

Conclusion

The Biden administration's vaccine mandates are a bold and necessary step to protect the health and safety of the American workforce and the general public. The mandates are likely to face legal challenges, but they are expected to have a significant impact on the fight against COVID-19.
