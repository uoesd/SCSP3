Ever Given Owner Braces for Legal Storm After Suez Canal Blockage

The owner of the Ever Given, the massive container ship that blocked the Suez Canal for six days in March, is bracing for a deluge of legal claims that could reach into the hundreds or thousands.

Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the Japanese owner of the Ever Given, and Evergreen Group, the Taiwanese company that chartered the ship, are the main parties involved in the legal proceedings.

A London court hearing on Friday granted a two-month stay on potential claims against the Ever Given, giving the parties time to prepare their defenses and consolidate similar claims.

"The stay will allow the parties to focus on the investigation into the cause of the grounding and to prepare their respective cases," said Stewart Buckingham, a lawyer representing the Ever Given's owners.

An earlier court order had limited some claims against the ship to 84 million pounds ($116 million). However, the full extent of the damages is still being assessed, and the final amount of compensation could be significantly higher.

The Ever Given blocked the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, from March 23 to 29, causing major disruptions to global trade. The ship was eventually dislodged after a massive salvage operation involving multiple tugboats and dredgers.

The Ever Given's owners have claimed that they are not liable for the grounding incident, arguing that it was caused by a sudden gust of wind and a loss of steering. However, investigators are still examining the exact cause of the accident.

There were some damages to the ship during the grounding, but no injuries, deaths, or pollution were reported from the incident.

The resolution of any claims filed in the U.K. could take years and may involve arbitration. The next court hearing is scheduled for two months, when the court will assess the filed claims and determine the next steps in the legal process.

The Suez Canal blockage highlighted the vulnerability of global supply chains to disruptions, and the legal fallout from the incident is likely to have a significant impact on the shipping industry.
