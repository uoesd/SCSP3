Laundrie Allegedly Hitchhiked in Wyoming Days Before Petito's Disappearance

WYOMING (WBAY) – A University of Wisconsin Oshkosh student claims she and her boyfriend gave a ride to Brian Laundrie in Grand Teton National Park on Aug. 29, just days before Gabby Petito's body was believed to have been found.

Miranda Baker shared her experience on TikTok, which prompted her to contact authorities to assist with the investigation.

"We were driving through Grand Teton National Park, and this man was standing on the side of the road," Baker said. "He looked disheveled, and he had a backpack on."

Baker and her boyfriend stopped to offer Laundrie a ride, and he accepted.

"He said he had been camping for several days and that his fiancée was back at their van working on their social media page," Baker said.

Baker found it odd that Laundrie offered to pay $200 for a ride that would only take about 10 miles.

"We were a little hesitant, but we ended up giving him a ride," Baker said.

As they drove, Laundrie told Baker and her boyfriend that he had been hiking in the park for several days and that he had lost his way back to his campsite.

"He seemed really anxious and kept looking over his shoulder," Baker said.

When Baker mentioned that they were heading to Jackson, Laundrie urgently requested to be let out of the vehicle.

"He said he needed to get to Jackson as soon as possible," Baker said.

Baker and her boyfriend dropped Laundrie off at around 6:09 p.m. on Aug. 29 at Jackson Dam, near Colter Bay.

"He said he was going to try to hitchhike the rest of the way," Baker said.

Baker said she did not think much of the encounter until she saw Laundrie's picture on the news.

"I realized that he was the person of interest in the Gabby Petito case," Baker said.

Baker contacted the FBI and provided them with the information she had.

"I hope that my information can help them find Gabby and bring her home," Baker said.

Laundrie returned to his home in North Port, Florida, on Sept. 1. Petito's family reported her missing on Sept. 11, and Laundrie has not cooperated with authorities.

On Aug. 12, a domestic violence incident involving Petito and Laundrie was reported in Utah, captured on bodycam footage, with no charges filed.

The FBI is still investigating the case, and Laundrie is considered a person of interest.
