ISIS-K: A Deadly Affiliate of ISIS in Afghanistan

CNN – ISIS-K, an affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) operating in Afghanistan, has emerged as one of the region's most feared terror groups. The group's recent claim of responsibility for the deadly Kabul airport bombing, which killed 13 US troops and more than 90 Afghans, has brought it into the global spotlight.

Origins and Formation

ISIS-K emerged in 2015 as a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It comprises Taliban defectors, veteran jihadists, and foreign fighters, primarily from Central Asia. The group's ideology aligns closely with that of ISIS, advocating for the establishment of a global caliphate governed by strict sharia law.

Deadly Operations

ISIS-K has been responsible for numerous deadly attacks in Afghanistan, including suicide bombings, assassinations, and assaults on civilians. The group's targets have ranged from Afghan security forces to government officials, religious minorities, and aid workers. In 2018, ISIS-K was ranked as the world's fourth deadliest terror group, responsible for over 1,000 deaths.

Strength and Operations

ISIS-K's strength is estimated to be around 1,500-2,000 fighters, primarily operating in eastern and northern Afghanistan. The group has established a network of sleeper cells in major cities, enabling it to carry out attacks with relative ease. Despite suffering setbacks in recent years, ISIS-K remains a significant threat to Afghanistan and the region.

Opposition to the Taliban

ISIS-K is opposed to the Taliban, which it views as too moderate. The group seeks to establish a caliphate that extends beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan, encompassing parts of Central Asia. ISIS-K has clashed with Taliban forces on several occasions, and its fighters have been targeted by US and Afghan airstrikes.

US Response

Following the Kabul airport bombing, US President Joe Biden vowed retribution against ISIS-K. The US military has conducted airstrikes against the group's positions in Afghanistan, and US forces have been involved in counterterrorism operations targeting ISIS-K. However, the group continues to pose a threat, and its ability to carry out attacks remains a concern.

Challenges and Future Prospects

ISIS-K faces several challenges, including the Taliban's efforts to suppress its activities, US airstrikes, and a lack of popular support. The group's ideology and brutal tactics have alienated many Afghans, and its future prospects remain uncertain. However, ISIS-K's ability to adapt and carry out deadly attacks suggests that it will continue to pose a threat to Afghanistan and the region for the foreseeable future.

Conclusion

ISIS-K is a dangerous and resilient terror group that has caused immense suffering in Afghanistan. The group's ideology, operational capabilities, and opposition to the Taliban make it a significant threat to regional stability. While US and Afghan forces have targeted ISIS-K, the group's ability to carry out attacks remains a concern. The long-term challenge of countering ISIS-K will require a comprehensive approach involving military operations, intelligence gathering, and efforts to address the underlying grievances that fuel extremism.
