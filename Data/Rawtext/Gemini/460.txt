Prince Philip: A Complex Figure with Mixed Feelings on Harry's Royal Exit

Prince Philip, the late Duke of Edinburgh and husband of Queen Elizabeth II, had a complex relationship with his grandson, Prince Harry. While he was initially disappointed by Harry's decision to step back from royal duties, he also understood his frustrations with the media.

According to biographer Gyles Brandreth, Philip was "very disappointed" by Harry's decision to leave the royal family. However, he also recognized that Harry was "frustrated" by the media's constant scrutiny. "He felt that the media was being unfair to Harry and Meghan," Brandreth said.

Despite his understanding of Harry's frustrations, Philip strongly disapproved of the couple's bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey. He reportedly called it "madness" and was particularly upset by the couple's public airing of personal grievances.

"He thought it was a very unwise thing to do," Brandreth said. "He felt that it was a betrayal of the family."

Philip's disapproval of the interview was not due to the timing of its airing while he was hospitalized. Rather, he was more concerned about the couple's decision to publicly discuss their private struggles.

"He was not upset about the interview airing while he was in hospital," Brandreth said. "He was more upset about the content of the interview."

Philip believed strongly in the importance of not focusing on oneself. He often advised his family against seeking popularity.

"He always said, 'Don't worry about what other people think. Just do what you think is right,'" Brandreth said.

Despite his disapproval of Harry's decision to step back from royal duties, Philip was proud of his grandson's military service. He was particularly impressed by Harry's appointment as Captain General of the Royal Marines.

"He was very proud of Harry's military career," Brandreth said. "He thought Harry was a very good soldier."

The decision for Harry and Meghan to step back from senior royal duties was agreed upon by the Queen, Prince Charles, and Prince William. The couple expressed their desire for more independent careers and a focus on philanthropy.

However, the couple's interview with Oprah aired a number of grievances against the royal family, including accusations of racism and neglect. The interview caused a significant rift between Harry and the royal family.

The upcoming funeral service for Philip at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, will spotlight Harry's interactions with the royal family. Observers are curious about the potential for reconciliation between Harry and the royal family, especially with his brother William.

"It will be interesting to see how Harry interacts with the royal family at the funeral," Brandreth said. "It will be a test of whether there is any chance of reconciliation."

Philip's complex relationship with Harry reflects the challenges and complexities of the royal family. While he was disappointed by Harry's decision to leave, he also understood his frustrations. Philip's legacy will continue to shape the royal family for years to come.
