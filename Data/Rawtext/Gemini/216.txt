Gas Shortage Hits Pensacola Amid Colonial Pipeline Shutdown

PENSACOLA, Fla. – A gas shortage is gripping the Pensacola area, leaving fuel pumps covered and causing long lines at stations that still have gas.

The shortage stems from the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline, a major fuel artery that supplies the East Coast, due to a ransomware attack. While Florida largely ships in its gas, AAA warns that the pipeline shutdown could drive up prices.

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) cites the pipeline hack and a truck driver shortage as reasons for the shortage. Additionally, a local fuel terminal in Pensacola failed to meet Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards, further impacting the supply.

"The failure of this terminal to meet EPA standards has exacerbated the supply chain issues we are currently experiencing," said Nikki Fried, Commissioner of FDACS. "I have reached out to the EPA for assistance in resolving this issue."

The EPA is currently seeking more information regarding the situation.

Officials are urging residents not to panic buy or hoard gas, as this could worsen the shortage. However, some residents, like Tieisha Brown, are concerned about the potential impacts.

"I'm worried about how this shortage will affect my ability to get to work and take care of my family," said Brown. "I hope it doesn't get worse."

The FDACS is working with fuel suppliers to increase deliveries to the area. However, it is unclear when the shortage will be resolved.

In the meantime, residents are advised to conserve gas and plan their trips accordingly. They should also be aware of potential price increases at the pump.
