FDA Statement on Omicron Variant Impacts and Ongoing Evaluation

Washington, D.C. – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is actively investigating the potential impacts of the new omicron COVID-19 variant on diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. The agency is working alongside federal partners, international regulators, and medical product companies to quickly address variant impacts.

"The FDA is closely monitoring the omicron variant and its potential implications for medical products," said FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, M.D. "We are working diligently to evaluate the variant's impact and determine if any modifications to our current vaccines or other medical products are necessary."

The evaluation of the omicron variant's impact on medical products is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. The FDA has monitored the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants throughout the pandemic and has contingency plans for new variants.

"We have taken steps to adapt to emerging variants, including requiring companies to monitor and evaluate impacts on their authorized products," said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "Previous actions include limiting use of certain monoclonal antibodies and updating healthcare providers on how variants affect therapeutics."

The ongoing evaluation may determine if current vaccines need modification to combat the omicron variant effectively. Preliminary review suggests PCR and antigen tests widely used in the U.S. are likely to continue working against the omicron variant.

"Vaccination remains the best way to protect yourself from COVID-19, including the omicron variant," said Marks. "Despite the emergence of new variants, current vaccines remain highly effective at preventing severe outcomes from COVID-19."

The FDA emphasizes the importance of vaccination and boosters for protection against COVID-19, including the omicron variant. The agency continues to recommend that all eligible individuals get vaccinated and boosted as soon as possible.

The FDA will continue to provide updates on the omicron variant and its potential impacts on medical products as more information becomes available.
