Rittenhouse Jury Views Videos of Fatal Kenosha Shootings

KENOSHA – A Kenosha County jury has viewed graphic videos showing Kyle Rittenhouse shooting three men during protests in August 2020. The videos, pieced together for the first time, depict the chaotic events of that night.

Rittenhouse, 17 at the time, crossed state lines from Illinois and was armed with an AR-15-style rifle during the Kenosha protests sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake. He has pleaded not guilty, claiming self-defense in the shootings of Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber, and Gaige Grosskreutz.

The videos shown to the jury included Rittenhouse's pre-shooting interviews and scenes from the night, including the moment he shot the three men.

"I saw a flash and I heard a bang," testified Koerri Washington, a social media influencer who witnessed the shootings. "I saw a guy fall to the ground."

Testimony also focused on Rittenhouse's actions before the shootings. Rosenbaum, who chased Rittenhouse, threw a plastic bag at him before being shot; he was not armed.

"He was trying to grab the barrel of the gun," said Kenosha Police Detective Martin Howard. "That's when Rittenhouse fired."

Jurors watched efforts to aid the injured Rosenbaum and Grosskreutz, the latter instructing on how to apply a tourniquet.

"I was trying to help him," testified Grosskreutz, who was shot in the arm. "I was telling him how to put a tourniquet on."

Rittenhouse approached police with raised arms after shooting Grosskreutz but was ignored.

"I thought I was going to die," Rittenhouse said in a pre-recorded interview played for the jury.

The defense stressed the threat of disarmament, with Howard testifying that it's reasonable to fear one's gun could be used against them.

"If someone is trying to take your gun, you have a right to defend yourself," Howard said.

The prosecution argued that Rittenhouse provoked the shootings by carrying a rifle and acting aggressively.

"He was looking for trouble," said Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger. "He wanted to be a hero."

The jury is expected to deliberate for several days before reaching a verdict.

Additional Testimony and Evidence:

  • Rittenhouse's mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, testified that her son was "a good kid" who was "trying to help people" on the night of the shootings.
  • A medical examiner testified that Rosenbaum died from a gunshot wound to the head, Huber died from a gunshot wound to the chest, and Grosskreutz was shot in the arm.
  • The jury also viewed drone footage of the shootings and heard from witnesses who saw Rittenhouse running from the scene.
  • The defense is expected to call several more witnesses, including Rittenhouse himself.
