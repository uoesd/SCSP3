Oil Prices Surge as Winter Storm Threatens Production

New York, NY - Oil prices surged on Monday, reaching their highest levels since January 2020, as a severe winter storm threatens to disrupt production in major oil-producing regions across the United States.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 24% in 2021 and touched a session high of $60.77, the highest since January 2020. Brent crude climbed 1.4% to $63.33, reaching a 13-month high.

The surge in oil prices is primarily driven by concerns over the impact of freezing weather across the U.S., which has increased demand for power and fuel while posing a threat to oil production.

"The cold weather is expected to affect oil production in Canada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, and elsewhere," said Andy Lipow, President of Lipow Oil Associates. "Over 150 million Americans are currently under some form of winter weather advisory."

A major winter storm is predicted to bring heavy snow and significant ice across various regions, including the Midwest, Northeast, and South.

"The frigid weather can lead to the shutting in of oil wells due to equipment freezing," Lipow explained. "The ongoing winter storm may also lead refineries to slow operations and prepare for outages."

The storm has already led to a steady rise in gasoline prices over the last week. According to AAA, the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline is now $2.42, up from $2.33 a week ago.

"The storm is likely to further exacerbate the supply-demand imbalance in the oil market," Lipow said. "We could see oil prices continue to rise in the coming days."

Analysts are closely monitoring the situation and assessing the potential impact on oil production and prices. The severity of the storm and its duration will play a crucial role in determining the extent of the disruption to the oil industry.
