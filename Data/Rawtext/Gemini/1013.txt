Twitter CEO Defends Trump Ban, Acknowledges Precedent Concerns

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has defended the company's decision to permanently ban US President Donald Trump from its platform, while acknowledging that it sets a dangerous precedent.

"We made a decision with the best information we had at the time, which is that the risk of further incitement of violence was high enough that we needed to take action," Dorsey said in a statement.

The ban came after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, in an attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election. Twitter removed Trump's account, which had 88 million followers, citing the risk of further violence.

Dorsey acknowledged that the ban raises concerns about free speech and the sharing of diverse viewpoints. "We do not make these decisions lightly, and we understand the important role that free speech plays in a healthy society," he said.

However, Dorsey emphasized that online speech can lead to offline harm, which guides Twitter's policy enforcement. "We believe that the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period of time outweigh the public interest value of allowing him to do so," he said.

The ban has drawn criticism from some Republicans and international figures, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who expressed concerns about its implications for free speech.

Dorsey defended Twitter's actions, saying that the company has attempted to reduce the need for bans with measures like labels, warnings, and distribution restrictions. "Our goal is to foster healthier conversations online," he said.

The collective action by social media companies in banning Trump was seen as bold but not coordinated, raising concerns about the future of the open internet.

The ban followed the Capitol riot and Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives for inciting an insurrection. He is the first president in US history to be impeached twice.
