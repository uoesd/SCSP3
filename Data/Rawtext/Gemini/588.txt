Taliban Blocks Afghans from Kabul Airport, Breaking Commitments

The Taliban is reportedly blocking Afghans from reaching Kabul's international airport, breaking commitments made to the United States. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has alerted people that it "cannot ensure safe passage" to the airport.

"We are deeply concerned by reports that the Taliban are blocking Afghans from reaching the airport," said Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. "We have made clear to the Taliban that they must allow all American citizens, third-country nationals, and Afghans who wish to leave the country to do so safely and without hindrance."

The U.S. military and a team in Qatar are engaging with the Taliban to ensure safe passage for Americans, third-country nationals, and Afghans. However, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated that the military cannot safely escort Americans in Kabul to the airport for evacuation.

"We are doing everything we can to facilitate the safe and orderly evacuation of American citizens, third-country nationals, and Afghans who wish to leave the country," said Sherman. "This is an all-hands-on-deck effort, and we aren't going to let up."

Despite the challenges, the U.S. has evacuated about 2,000 people in the past 24 hours, with over 4,840 processed for evacuation over the previous days. The Biden administration faces criticism over the handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, but the administration maintains that it is doing everything it can to ensure the safe evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies.

4,500 U.S. troops have been deployed to Hamid Karzai International Airport to facilitate the evacuation. The U.S. has also established a team in Qatar to help coordinate the evacuation efforts.

Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mitt Romney urged the U.S. to not forget Afghan journalists and support staff seeking evacuation. "We must not leave behind those who have risked their lives to help us," said Klobuchar.
