Born in Queens, New York, on June 14, 1946, Trump inherited his father's real estate company in 1971. Under his leadership, the company expanded into various sectors, including hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump gained prominence as a successful businessman and author, penning several books including "The Art of the Deal."

Reality TV and Political Ambitions

Trump's foray into entertainment came with the launch of the reality TV show "The Apprentice." The show's popularity propelled him into the public eye and fueled his political aspirations. In 2015, he announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination.

Trump's unconventional campaign, marked by populist rhetoric and controversial statements, defied political norms. He defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, winning the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote.

Presidency: Accomplishments and Controversies

Trump's presidency was a rollercoaster of accomplishments and controversies. He enacted tax reform, imposed trade tariffs, and appointed conservative judges to the federal judiciary. His administration also moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and engaged in historic talks with North Korea.

However, Trump's presidency was also marred by scandals and investigations. A partial government shutdown occurred in 2018 due to disagreements over funding for a border wall. In 2019, he was impeached by the House of Representatives for obstruction and abuse of power, but was acquitted by the Senate.
