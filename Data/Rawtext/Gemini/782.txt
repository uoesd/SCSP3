Democrats Push for $2,000 Monthly Stimulus Checks Until Pandemic's End

Amidst the ongoing economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing chorus of Democrats in Congress is advocating for recurring $2,000 monthly stimulus checks until the crisis subsides.

"We need to make sure that every American has the resources they need to survive this pandemic," said Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), one of the leading proponents of the proposal. "Monthly $2,000 checks would provide a lifeline to families struggling to make ends meet."

Omar and a group of other House Democrats have sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to support their plan. A similar letter is expected from a group of Senate Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

The proposal calls for direct payments to individuals and automatic unemployment insurance extensions tied to economic conditions. While the House Democrats' letter specifically mentions $2,000 monthly checks, the Senate Democrats' upcoming letter does not specify a dollar amount or frequency.

"We need to act boldly to address the economic crisis facing working families," Sanders said. "Recurring stimulus checks would provide much-needed relief and help prevent millions of Americans from falling into poverty."

According to the Urban Institute, a one-time $1,200 stimulus check and enhanced unemployment insurance could prevent 12 million people from falling into poverty. However, the institute also notes that the impact of recurring checks would depend on their duration and frequency.

The U.S. Senate is currently considering Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which includes a one-time, $1,400 stimulus check. While the package has the support of most Democrats, Senate Republicans and some moderate Democrats, such as Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), are unlikely to support monthly $2,000 stimulus checks.

"I don't think that's a realistic expectation," Manchin said. "We need to be fiscally responsible and focus on targeted relief for those who need it most."

President Biden, a moderate Democrat, is also seen as unlikely to support the proposal for recurring checks. However, supporters of the plan argue that 65% of Americans, including majorities of Republicans and independents, favor them.

"The American people are demanding bold action," Warren said. "Monthly stimulus checks would provide a lifeline to families and help our economy recover."

The debate over recurring stimulus checks is likely to continue as Congress considers Biden's stimulus package. While the proposal faces significant opposition from Republicans and some moderate Democrats, its supporters argue that it is essential to address the ongoing economic crisis and prevent millions of Americans from falling into poverty.
