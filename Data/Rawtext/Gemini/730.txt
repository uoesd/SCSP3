Dakota High School Swatting Incident: Student Used 'Dark Web' to Pay for False Threat

(WXYZ) – A Dakota High School student is facing charges after allegedly using the "dark web" to pay for a fake shooting threat at the school.

On April 19, the Macomb County Sheriff's Office responded to a false report of an "active shooter incident" at Dakota High School. Two hoax calls were made to dispatchers, one posing as a victim and another as a staff member reporting a shooter.

"We treat every threat as if it's real," said Macomb County Sheriff Anthony Wickersham. "We have to respond with the utmost urgency to ensure the safety of our students and staff."

No evidence of an actual shooting was found at the scene. However, investigators traced the calls to a juvenile student who had allegedly arranged for the false threats through a contact made on the "dark web."

"It's a very serious matter," said Superintendent Ron Roberts of Chippewa Valley Schools. "Every threat, no matter how small, must be taken seriously. The consequences can be severe."

The student is facing a count of False Threat of Terrorism. The investigation is ongoing to address and mitigate such threats and maintain the safety and security of students and staff.

"Swatting calls are not a joke," said Sheriff Wickersham. "They put our community at risk and waste valuable resources. We will continue to hold those responsible accountable."

Superintendent Roberts emphasized the importance of reporting any suspicious activity or threats to school officials or law enforcement. "We all have a role to play in keeping our schools safe," he said.
