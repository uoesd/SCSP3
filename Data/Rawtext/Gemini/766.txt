Baldwin Described as Cautious with Firearms on 'Rust' Set, Search Warrant Affidavit Reveals

Santa Fe, New Mexico - Newly released details from a search warrant affidavit shed light on the tragic shooting incident that occurred on the set of the Western film "Rust" last Thursday, resulting in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

According to cameraman Reid Russell, Alec Baldwin, who discharged the prop gun that killed Hutchins, was "very careful" when handling firearms on set. "He always checked the gun before he took it," Russell stated.

The affidavit, filed by Detective Joel Cano of the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department, reveals that assistant director Dave Halls was unaware that the prop gun handed to Baldwin contained live rounds. "I didn't know live rounds were in the gun," Halls admitted.

Cano's affidavit provides a detailed account of the events leading up to the shooting. Director Joel Souza and Hutchins were preparing a scene when Baldwin discharged the firearm during a rehearsal. "The firearm was pointed at the victim, Halyna Hutchins," Cano wrote.

The affidavit suggests that only one bullet was fired, which passed through Hutchins and then struck Souza. Hutchins reportedly told Souza, "I can't feel my legs," before receiving medical attention.

The affidavit also highlights that the film's crew had experienced issues, including a walkout by seven camera crew members hours before the incident. Detective Cano noted challenges on the set, such as delays caused by having to find a replacement camera crew.

"There were issues on the set," Cano stated. "There were concerns about safety."

The spent casing from the fired prop gun was retrieved by the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, indicating that a single shot was fired.

"I checked the firearm and there was one spent casing inside the cylinder," Gutierrez stated.

The Santa Fe Sheriff's Department and District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies have announced a joint press conference regarding the investigation.

"We are still investigating the circumstances surrounding this incident," Carmack-Altwies said. "We will provide more information as it becomes available."

The investigation into the "Rust" shooting is ongoing, and no charges have been filed at this time.
