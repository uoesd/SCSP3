History Unfolds: Stacey Plaskett, First Delegate to Serve as Impeachment Manager

In a historic first, Stacey Plaskett, a delegate representing the US Virgin Islands, has taken her place as part of the team of impeachment managers presenting the case against former President Donald Trump in the Senate trial.

"It is with great pride that I introduce the first delegate in American history to serve as an impeachment manager," declared Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who introduced Plaskett to the Senate.

Plaskett, currently in her fourth term representing the US Virgin Islands' at-large congressional district, has been a vocal critic of Trump and his actions leading up to the January 6th Capitol riot. As a delegate, she does not have the right to vote on the House floor, including on the impeachment vote against Trump. However, she is fully participating in the Senate trial as a prosecutor, tasked with proving that Trump incited an insurrection.

"I am honored to serve as an impeachment manager and to present the case against Donald Trump," Plaskett said. "I believe that he is guilty of inciting an insurrection, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that he is held accountable for his actions."

Plaskett is one of nine House Democrats serving as impeachment managers for the trial. She brings a wealth of experience to the role, having previously worked as an assistant district attorney and senior counsel at the US Department of Justice.

In her opening statement, Plaskett emphasized her personal and professional journey, highlighting her background and commitment to truth and preparation. "I stand before you today as a daughter of the Virgin Islands, a former prosecutor, and a lifelong champion of justice," she said.

Plaskett's appointment as an impeachment manager is a testament to her qualifications and dedication to the rule of law. It also underscores the growing role of delegates in the US political system. Currently, there are five delegates representing various non-state territories in the House of Representatives.

Raskin, who was Plaskett's law professor at American University Washington College of Law, commended her academic excellence and current performance. "Stacey Plaskett is a brilliant lawyer and a tireless advocate for justice," he said. "I am confident that she will serve our country with distinction as an impeachment manager."

Plaskett's historic role in the Trump impeachment trial is a testament to her determination and commitment to upholding the Constitution. Her presence on the impeachment team sends a clear message that all Americans, regardless of their place of residence, have a voice in the political process.
