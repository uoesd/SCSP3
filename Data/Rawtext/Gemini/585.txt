Twin Blasts in Kabul: ISIS-K Blamed, Taliban Faces Terrorism Test

Washington, D.C. - The United States has blamed ISIS-K, an affiliate of the Islamic State group, for the twin blasts outside Kabul's airport that killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members. The attack has highlighted the continued terrorism threat in Afghanistan, even after the Taliban's takeover of the country.

"We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay," President Biden vowed in a televised address to the nation.

The attack has raised questions about the Taliban's ability to control the country and prevent it from becoming a safe haven for terrorist groups. The Taliban, which is seen as a more moderate group compared to ISIS-K, has promised to root out the extremist faction.

"We will not allow any terrorist group to operate in Afghanistan," Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem said.

However, experts are skeptical about the Taliban's ability to fulfill this promise.

"The Taliban has a long history of ties to al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups," said Fawaz Gerges, a professor at the London School of Economics. "It is unlikely that they will be able to completely sever these ties."

In addition to ISIS-K, al-Qaeda remains a presence in Afghanistan. A recent U.N. report estimated that the group has several dozen to 500 members in the country.

"Al-Qaeda is considerably weakened, but it still maintains a presence in Afghanistan," said Abdul Sayed, an Afghanistan analyst. "The Taliban and al-Qaeda share a common ideology and personal relationships, so it is difficult to say whether the Taliban will be able to separate themselves from al-Qaeda."

ISIS-K, which is distinct from the Taliban and al-Qaeda, started operations in Afghanistan in 2015. The group has carried out numerous attacks on civilians and has ambitions of territorial control.

"ISIS-K is a resilient group within Afghanistan," said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center. "They are unlikely to be able to plan far-reaching attacks, but their presence raises concerns for Afghanistan's neighbors."

President Biden defended the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, saying that the original mission to neutralize al-Qaeda after the 9/11 attacks had been accomplished.

"We went to Afghanistan to deal with the threat from al-Qaeda," Biden said. "That mission has been successful."

However, some experts argue that the U.S. withdrawal has created a vacuum that will be filled by terrorist groups.

"The U.S. withdrawal has left a power vacuum in Afghanistan that will be exploited by terrorist groups," said Nathan Sales, a former senior counterterrorism official. "We are likely to see an increase in terrorist activity in the coming months and years."

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the U.S. will continue to work with the Taliban to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorists.

"We will hold the Taliban accountable for the commitments they have made," Blinken said. "We will not hesitate to take action against any terrorist group that threatens the United States or its allies."

The twin blasts in Kabul have served as a stark reminder of the challenges facing Afghanistan and the international community. The Taliban faces a difficult task in rooting out terrorist groups and preventing the country from becoming a safe haven for terrorism. The U.S. and its allies will need to continue to work with the Taliban to ensure that Afghanistan does not become a breeding ground for terrorism.
