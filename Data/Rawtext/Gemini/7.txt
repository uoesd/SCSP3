FBI Warns of Armed Protests Ahead of Biden's Inauguration

Washington, D.C. - The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has issued a warning of potential armed protests in all 50 states and the US capital ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20.

The warning comes amid heightened security concerns following the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, which left five people dead.

State Officials Prepare for Demonstrations

State officials across the country are preparing for potentially violent demonstrations in support of President Donald Trump.

"We are aware of the potential for armed protests and are taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety of our citizens," said Steve McCraw, Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety.

In Michigan, State Police Director Joe Gasper said, "We are closely monitoring the situation and are prepared to respond to any threats to public safety."

National Guard Activated

National Guard forces have been activated in several states, including California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Florida.

In Washington, D.C., thousands of armed National Guard troops are on the streets ahead of the inauguration.

Arrested Man Claims 'Honest Mistake'

On January 14, a man named Wesley Allen Beeler was arrested at a security checkpoint near the US Capitol with a loaded handgun and over 500 rounds of ammunition.

Beeler claimed it was "an honest mistake" and that he was a private security guard who got lost.

"I had no intention of harming anyone," Beeler said.

FBI Warns of Protests at State Capitols

The FBI has warned of potential violent protests at all 50 state capitol buildings starting on Saturday and lasting through Biden's inauguration.

The anti-government "Boogaloo" movement plans to hold rallies in all 50 states on Sunday.

State Security Measures

State officials are taking various security measures, including:

  • Closing the Texas Capitol
  • Erecting a fence around the Michigan Capitol
  • Increasing police presence at state capitols

Congressional Review of Capitol Riot

Democratic leaders of four US congressional committees have opened a review of the January 6 riot at the US Capitol.

"We must get to the bottom of what happened and hold those responsible accountable," said Don Beyer, Democratic US Representative from Virginia.

The review will be led by House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler.
