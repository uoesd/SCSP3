Taliban Blames U.S. for Kabul Airport Attack, Vows to Control Terrorism

Kabul, Afghanistan - The Taliban has blamed the United States for the deadly August 27 attack at Kabul airport, claiming that they can effectively control terrorism within Afghanistan.

"The Americans have failed to manage the evacuation process, which has led to this tragic incident," said Bilal Karimi, a spokesman for the Taliban military leadership. "We are capable of ensuring security and preventing such attacks in the future."

ISIS-K, an Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the airport attack, which marked the deadliest day for the U.S. military since 2011. Thirteen U.S. service members and over 170 Afghan civilians were killed in the bombing.

Karimi criticized the U.S. evacuation strategy, attributing the airport attack to poor planning by the U.S. military. "The Americans should have coordinated with us to ensure a smooth and orderly evacuation," he said.

Despite the Taliban's assertions, ISIS-K has already claimed responsibility for the deadly attack, raising concerns about the group's resurgence in Afghanistan.

Taliban's Promises and Restrictions

Karimi also addressed the concerns of foreign nationals and women in Afghanistan. He promised that the Taliban would not harm Spanish nationals and encouraged knowledgeable individuals to contribute to Afghanistan's prosperity.

"We forgive all foreign nationals who worked with the previous government," Karimi said. "They can lead normal lives and leave the country legally when the situation normalizes."

Regarding women's rights, the Taliban claims to support equal opportunities for women to study and work, provided they comply with Islamic law. However, the Taliban emphasizes the importance of women wearing hijabs and adhering to Islamic dress codes to prevent "provoking men."

"Women should wear hijabs to protect their dignity and honor," Karimi said. "It is not a restriction but a way to ensure their safety."

Women's Protests and Taliban Crackdowns

Despite the Taliban's claims, women across Afghanistan have protested against the group's conservative laws, facing militant crackdowns. Women have been beaten, detained, and even killed for participating in protests.

The Taliban's rapid takeover of Afghanistan followed the withdrawal of U.S. and Western troops, ending over two decades of military presence. The Taliban's return to power has raised concerns about the future of human rights and democracy in Afghanistan.

International Response

The international community has condemned the Kabul airport attack and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. The United States has vowed to continue counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan and has launched airstrikes against ISIS-K targets.

The United Nations has also expressed concern about the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, with millions of people facing food shortages and displacement. The UN has called for international aid to be scaled up to prevent a humanitarian crisis.

The Taliban's ability to control terrorism and ensure stability in Afghanistan remains uncertain. The group faces challenges from ISIS-K and other militant groups, as well as the need to address the economic and humanitarian crisis facing the country.
