Greene Proposes Congressional Gold Medal for Rittenhouse

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has introduced a bill to award Kyle Rittenhouse the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor bestowed by the United States Congress. The bill claims that Rittenhouse deserves the honor for "protecting the community of Kenosha" during a "Black Lives Matter riot."

The bill is unlikely to pass, as it requires two-thirds co-sponsorship in a House controlled by Democrats, many of whom have criticized Rittenhouse. Greene has been a vocal supporter of Rittenhouse, commending his actions and celebrating his acquittal on social media.

"Kyle Rittenhouse is a hero who defended himself and his community from a violent mob," Greene said in a statement. "He deserves to be recognized for his bravery and courage."

Rep. Matt Gaetz's (R-Fla.) spokesperson, however, expressed reservations about the potential impact of awarding Rittenhouse the medal. "We're concerned that giving him the Congressional Gold Medal could inflate his ego and make him less likely to accept an internship with our office," the spokesperson said.

Rittenhouse was found not guilty of intentional and reckless homicide after killing two men at a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020. He argued that he was in Kenosha to protect local businesses with a rifle and medic kit, while prosecutors said he incited violence.

The verdict received mixed reactions, with conservatives praising it and liberals denouncing it as a miscarriage of justice. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) supported the jury's decision, saying, "The jury got it right." Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), on the other hand, criticized the verdict, tweeting, "This is what it looks like when white supremacy is normalized."
