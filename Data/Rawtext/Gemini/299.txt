Tennessee Accelerates COVID-19 Vaccine Eligibility for All Adults by April 5

NASHVILLE – Tennessee Governor Bill Lee announced today that all Tennessee adults will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccination by April 5, 2021.

"This is a significant step forward in our fight against COVID-19," said Governor Lee. "Expanding vaccine eligibility to all adults will allow us to protect more Tennesseans and get our state back to normal."

Effective March 18, 2021, Tennesseans aged 55 and older, along with those in Phase 2 of the vaccination plan, are eligible to receive the vaccine. Phase 2 includes essential workers in several key industries not covered in earlier phases, such as manufacturing, transportation, and construction.

Beginning April 5, 2021, eligibility will extend to all Tennesseans age 16 and over.

Phase 3 of the vaccination plan, which includes congregate living staff and residents, and grocery store workers not previously eligible, will receive direct allocations of vaccines to facilities housing those eligible.

"We are pleased to be able to expand vaccine eligibility ahead of the federal goal of May 1 for adult eligibility," said Tennessee Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey, MD, MBA, FAAP. "This is a testament to the hard work of our healthcare providers and the Tennessee Department of Health."

Tennessee has received 2.9 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to date and expects around 311,000 vaccine doses the week of March 22. Increased supplies of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine are expected the week of March 29.

"We encourage all Tennesseans to get vaccinated as soon as they are eligible," said Governor Lee. "The vaccine is safe and effective, and it is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from COVID-19."
