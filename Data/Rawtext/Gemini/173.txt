Virginia Democrat Accuses Mossad of Fueling Wars, Draws Criticism

ARLINGTON, Virginia – Virginia Democratic delegate Ibraheem Samirah has sparked controversy with a series of tweets accusing Israel's Mossad of creating "fossil fuel wars," including the Iran-Iraq war and the 2003 Iraq war.

Samirah's comments came in response to the Sunrise Movement's call to boycott a rally due to the participation of Jewish movements with Israel ties. He tweeted, "I stand with @SunriseMvmt in boycotting this rally. We cannot allow fossil fuel companies to use Jewish orgs as cover for their destruction of our planet."

In a subsequent tweet, Samirah referenced a Guardian article alleging Mossad's role in creating wars, although the article did not support his claim. He also blamed Israel for the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, citing a 1986 New York Times article about Israel's weapons deals with the Shah of Iran.

Samirah's tweets have drawn criticism from Republicans, who have accused Democrats of failing to condemn his remarks. "Where is the outrage from Democrats?" tweeted Boris Epshteyn, a Jewish adviser to former President Donald Trump. "This is antisemitism, plain and simple."

The Democratic Majority for Israel dismissed Samirah's remarks, noting his defeat in a recent Democratic primary. "Samirah's views are not representative of the Democratic Party," said a spokesperson.

Samirah, who is of Palestinian American descent, has a history of activism. In 2019, he disrupted a rally by Donald Trump. His father, a Muslim activist, was deported in 2003 by the Bush administration but ordered returned by a US judge a decade later.

Samirah has also criticized the conflation of Judaism with Zionism, which he deems a form of antisemitism. "Judaism is not Zionism," he tweeted. "Zionism is a political ideology that has caused immense suffering to Palestinians."

Samirah's comments have sparked a debate about the role of antisemitism in the progressive movement. Some have accused the Sunrise Movement of fostering an anti-Israel sentiment, while others have defended the group's right to criticize Israel's policies.

The controversy has also highlighted the growing divide within the Democratic Party over Israel. While many Democrats support Israel, a growing number of progressives have become increasingly critical of the Israeli government's treatment of Palestinians.

Samirah's tweets have reignited this debate and raised questions about the future of the Democratic Party's relationship with Israel.
