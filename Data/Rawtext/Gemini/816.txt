Second Stimulus Checks Begin Rolling Out, Offering $600 to Eligible Americans

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has commenced the distribution of the second round of stimulus checks, providing $600 to each eligible adult and child. The payments, authorized under the recently passed COVID-19 relief package, are intended to offer financial assistance to Americans struggling amid the ongoing pandemic.

Direct deposits have already begun and will continue throughout the week. Paper checks, meanwhile, started mailing on December 30 for those without bank information on file with the IRS. However, many recipients remain uncertain about the exact arrival of their checks due to the IRS' "Get My Payment" website being offline.

"The IRS is experiencing high demand for the 'Get My Payment' tool, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause," said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig. "We are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible."

The second stimulus follows the first round of payments distributed under the CARES Act in the spring. That initial round faced challenges, including delayed payments for those without bank information on file.

"The IRS will be distributing funds using the same methods as the first round," said Mark Steber, chief tax information officer at Jackson Hewitt. "So, if you received your first payment by direct deposit, you should expect the second payment the same way."

The "Get My Payment" tool is expected to resume operation next week, allowing recipients to track both the first and second stimulus payments. Automatic payments will be made to those who filed a 2019 tax return, receive specific government benefits, or used the Non-Filers tool by November 21.

The payments are not taxable, and recipients are advised to keep IRS Notice 1444 for any additional amount due on their 2020 tax return.

"It's important to note that these payments are not an advance on your 2020 tax refund," said Steber. "They are a separate payment from the IRS."

The second stimulus package expands eligibility compared to the CARES Act. Mixed-status households, previously denied under the CARES Act, are now eligible for the second round of payments.

"This is a welcome change that will help many families who were left out of the first round of payments," said Steber.

Despite the progress in distributing the second stimulus checks, some lawmakers have expressed disappointment over the amount of the payments. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a vote to increase the stimulus checks to $2,000, as requested by President Trump.

"I think the American people deserve more than $600," said Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT). "This is a pittance. It's not going to be enough to help people pay their rent, put food on the table, or keep their businesses afloat."

The second stimulus package provides a total of $900 billion in relief, including $300 billion for direct payments to individuals and families. The package also extends unemployment benefits and provides funding for vaccine distribution and testing.

"This package is a step in the right direction, but it's not enough," said Steber. "We need to do more to help people who are struggling during this pandemic."
