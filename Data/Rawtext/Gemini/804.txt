Billionaires Collected Stimulus Checks Despite Paying Little or No Taxes

A bombshell investigation by ProPublica has revealed that numerous billionaires received taxpayer-funded stimulus checks during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite having paid little or no taxes in recent years. This revelation exposes loopholes in the tax system that allow the ultrawealthy to minimize their tax burden and qualify for government assistance intended for struggling Americans.

CARES Act Eligibility and Billionaire Stimulus Checks

In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted, providing emergency payments to households earning below certain income thresholds. The eligibility criteria were based on prior tax returns, which allowed some billionaires to qualify for stimulus checks despite their immense wealth.

Billionaires Who Received Stimulus Checks

ProPublica's analysis identified at least 18 billionaires who received stimulus payments. Among them were Ira Rennert, a metals magnate, and George Soros, a renowned investor. Both men qualified for stimulus checks because their reported taxable income fell below the government's threshold due to deductions.

Tax Deductions and Negative Net Income

The wealthy often report much lower taxable incomes by using business write-offs and other deductions. Some even report negative net incomes after deductions. This allows them to avoid paying significant taxes and qualify for government assistance programs.

ProPublica's Findings

ProPublica found 270 taxpayers who disclosed $5.7 billion in income but used deductions to qualify for stimulus checks. These individuals had an average effective tax rate of just 3.4%, far below the 37% rate paid by the average American.

Flexible Income Sources and Tax Avoidance

The ultrawealthy's income rarely comes from wages but from flexible sources such as investments and business ventures. This allows them to minimize taxes via losses and deductions.

Impact on CARES Act Spending

While the amount received by the ultrawealthy was small compared to the total CARES Act spending, their qualification highlights issues with using tax returns to determine aid eligibility.

Criticism from Senate Finance Committee Chair

Senate Finance Committee chair Ron Wyden criticized the tax code's inability to fairly tax billionaires. "The fact that billionaires are getting these checks shows that our tax code is broken," he said. "It's time for us to fix it."

Responses from Ultrawealthy Stimulus Recipients

Several ultrawealthy stimulus recipients, such as the Dart family scion and Joseph DiMenna, either returned their checks or emphasized that they didn't request them.

Conclusion

ProPublica's investigation has exposed a glaring loophole in the tax system that allows billionaires to pay little or no taxes and still qualify for government assistance. This revelation raises questions about the fairness of the tax code and the effectiveness of using tax returns to determine eligibility for aid programs.
