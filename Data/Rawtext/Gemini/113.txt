Cuomo Brothers Accused of Special COVID-19 Testing Privileges

NEW YORK (AP) – CNN anchor Chris Cuomo reportedly received special COVID-19 testing due to his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, according to a new report.

An aide to New York's health commissioner administered the COVID-19 test at Chris Cuomo's home and expedited its processing, the report said. The special treatment occurred in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, around March last year.

Chris Cuomo had contracted COVID-19 and continued to anchor his show from quarantine. Andrew Cuomo appeared on Chris Cuomo's CNN show several times, leading to ethical concerns. CNN has since banned Andrew Cuomo from appearing on Chris Cuomo's show.

CNN defended Chris Cuomo's actions, stating he sought help during a critical time of the pandemic.

"Chris Cuomo was not treated differently than any other New Yorker who was seeking a COVID-19 test at the time," a CNN spokesperson said. "He was tested by a New York State Department of Health employee at his home, and the test was processed through the state's public health system."

Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, stated the administration helped many people get tested early in the pandemic.

"The administration helped many people get tested early on, including members of the media," Azzopardi said. "This was done to ensure that essential workers and those who were most vulnerable had access to testing."

Journalist Glenn Greenwald criticized Chris Cuomo's actions as an abuse of power.

"This is a clear abuse of power," Greenwald said. "Chris Cuomo used his position to get special treatment for himself and his brother, while ordinary New Yorkers were struggling to get tested."

Chris Cuomo is currently off-air but is expected to return to his show next Monday.

The report has raised questions about the ethics of journalists receiving special treatment from government officials. It has also renewed scrutiny of the relationship between Chris Cuomo and his brother, Andrew Cuomo.

Andrew Cuomo has been under fire for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, including his decision to undercount nursing home deaths. He is also facing allegations of sexual harassment from multiple women.

The allegations against Andrew Cuomo have cast a shadow over his brother's career. Chris Cuomo has been accused of using his show to promote his brother's agenda and of failing to hold him accountable for his actions.

The latest report about Chris Cuomo's special COVID-19 testing privileges is likely to further damage his reputation and raise more questions about the ethics of his journalism.
