AMA Urges Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccinations for Health Care Workers

Chicago, IL - The American Medical Association (AMA) today issued a statement calling for all health care and long-term care employers to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for their employees. The statement emphasizes the importance of vaccination for patient and colleague safety, especially in light of the recent surge in cases driven by contagious variants and unvaccinated populations.

"As health care professionals, we have a duty to protect our patients and colleagues from harm," said Susan R. Bailey, M.D., immediate past president of the AMA. "Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and its potentially devastating consequences."

Over 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States and nearly 4 billion worldwide, demonstrating their safety and efficacy. Numerous health care organizations, including the AMA, the American Hospital Association, and the American Nurses Association, advocate for mandatory vaccinations for health care and long-term care workers.

"The recent surge in COVID-19 cases underscores the urgent need for vaccination," said Dr. Bailey. "Many health care and long-term care workers remain unvaccinated, putting vulnerable populations at risk."

The AMA's statement acknowledges that some workers may be exempt from mandates due to medical reasons, but emphasizes that these exemptions are rare. Existing vaccine mandates have been effective in increasing vaccination rates among health care workers, but the statement also recognizes the need to address historical mistrust in health care institutions.

"We encourage health care employers to lead by example and implement vaccine mandates for their employees," said Dr. Bailey. "By doing so, we can create a safer environment for patients, colleagues, and the communities we serve."

The AMA's call for mandatory vaccinations is supported by a growing consensus among experts and institutions. The World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Academy of Medicine all recommend vaccination for health care workers.

"The health care community has a responsibility to protect the public's health," said Dr. Bailey. "By mandating COVID-19 vaccinations for our employees, we can demonstrate our commitment to patient safety and help bring an end to this pandemic."
