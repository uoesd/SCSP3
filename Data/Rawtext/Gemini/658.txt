GoFundMe Revises Policies on Legal Defense Fundraisers After Rittenhouse Acquittal

In the wake of Kyle Rittenhouse's not-guilty verdict, GoFundMe has clarified its policies on fundraising for legal defenses. The crowdfunding platform previously prohibited fundraisers for individuals charged with violent crimes. However, following Rittenhouse's acquittal, GoFundMe announced that individuals acquitted of such charges could now have fundraisers for legal defense and living expenses.

This stance suggests that GoFundMe will not allow fundraisers for convicted individuals, sparking debate over fairness and the potential for wrongful convictions. The company faced backlash and disabled replies to its tweet explaining the policy.

In response, GoFundMe posted a detailed explanation on Medium about its Terms of Service in light of the Rittenhouse case. The company insists that its policies aim to prevent fundraisers that support hate, violence, harassment, bullying, discrimination, or involve weaponry.

The situation has raised questions about the moral authority and consistency of GoFundMe's policies. Some argue that the company should not make judgments about the guilt or innocence of individuals, while others believe that GoFundMe has a responsibility to prevent its platform from being used to support harmful activities.

GoFundMe asserts that it continually evaluates and evolves its Terms of Service to address new factors. The company claims to prioritize human rights in its fundraising policies, stating that it "will not allow fundraisers that support hate, violence, harassment, bullying, discrimination, or involve weaponry."

The Rittenhouse case has highlighted the complex issues surrounding fundraising for legal defenses. GoFundMe's revised policies attempt to strike a balance between protecting human rights and ensuring that its platform is not used for harmful purposes. However, the debate over the fairness and consistency of these policies is likely to continue.
