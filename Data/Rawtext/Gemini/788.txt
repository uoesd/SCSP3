Third Stimulus Checks: What to Know About Garnishment and Tax Returns

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has distributed approximately 90 million stimulus checks worth $1,400 to eligible Americans as part of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. While the majority of recipients have received their payments, some may still be waiting or may have questions about how the payments will affect their tax returns or outstanding debts.

Recovery Rebate Credits for Missed Stimulus Checks

Individuals who did not receive their first or second stimulus checks can claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 federal tax return. This credit will allow them to receive the missing payments as a tax refund.

Garnishment of Stimulus Checks

The December $900 billion Covid relief bill protected the second round of stimulus checks from all creditor garnishment, including private creditors. However, this protection does not apply to the third stimulus checks under the American Rescue Plan.

Tax Refunds and the Treasury Offset Program

Tax refunds, including stimulus payments received as a tax rebate, may be subject to garnishment through the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). This program allows the IRS to offset tax refunds to pay back various debts, such as child support, back taxes, and other outstanding debts.

IRS and Stimulus Payments

The IRS will not use stimulus rebates to pay for federal tax debts. However, the IRS cannot prevent offsets for state and other federal agency debts.

Garnishment of Third Stimulus Checks

The $1,400 stimulus check under the American Rescue Plan is not subject to garnishment for unpaid federal or state debts. However, it can be garnished for private debts under a court order.

Advocacy for Garnishment Exemption

Consumer advocacy and banking groups are urging Congress to pass legislation to exempt the latest stimulus payments from garnishment. The American Bankers Association and Americans for Financial Reform are among the groups advocating for this legislation.

Tracking Stimulus Payments

The IRS's Get My Payment site can be used to track the status of the third stimulus payment. Individuals can enter their Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) and their birth date to check the status of their payment.
