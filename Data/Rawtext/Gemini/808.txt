Fourth Stimulus Check Unlikely, Despite Petition's Millions of Signatures

Despite a petition garnering over 2.9 million signatures advocating for recurring $2,000 stimulus payments, a fourth federal stimulus check remains highly improbable. The White House has repeatedly expressed its opposition to additional direct payments, citing the need to focus on other economic recovery measures.

"We're not considering additional stimulus checks at this time," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki stated. "We're focused on implementing the American Rescue Plan and continuing to support the economic recovery."

State Governments Step Up with Financial Relief

In the absence of federal action, several state governments have taken the initiative to provide financial assistance to their residents. California, for instance, has distributed a second round of Golden State Stimulus checks, with payments ranging from $600 to $1,100.

"These payments will provide much-needed relief to low-income Californians who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic," said Governor Gavin Newsom.

Targeted Assistance for Low-Income Families and Educators

Maryland has allocated funds for direct payments of $300 or $500 to low-income individuals and families. Additionally, educators in states such as Florida, Michigan, and Tennessee have received bonuses in recognition of their efforts during the pandemic.

"These bonuses are a small token of our appreciation for the incredible work that our educators have done," said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

Advance Child Tax Credit Payments Continue

The advance monthly child tax credit payments of up to $300 per child are ongoing through December. These payments are part of the expanded child tax credit included in the American Rescue Plan, which provides up to $3,600 per child for qualifying families.

"These payments are making a real difference in the lives of millions of American families," said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

Families Can Choose Monthly or Lump Sum Payments

Families eligible for the expanded child tax credit have the option of receiving their payments monthly or in a lump sum. The monthly payments provide consistent financial support, while the lump sum option allows families to address larger expenses.

"We want to give families the flexibility to choose the option that best meets their needs," said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig.

Third Stimulus Payments Still Being Distributed

The third round of stimulus payments, authorized in March 2021, is still being distributed. These payments of up to $1,400 are available to eligible individuals and families.

"We encourage everyone who is eligible to claim their third stimulus payment," said Rettig.

California's Golden State Stimulus I and II

California's Golden State Stimulus I and II programs provide one-time payments of $600 or $1,100 to low-income residents. These payments are intended to supplement the federal stimulus checks and provide additional support during the pandemic.

"We know that many Californians are still struggling financially," said Newsom. "These payments will help them make ends meet and get back on their feet."

Maryland's Targeted Assistance

Maryland's direct payments are targeted at individuals and families claiming the earned income tax credit. The state has also provided additional support for the unemployed and small businesses.

"We are committed to helping Marylanders who have been impacted by the pandemic," said Governor Larry Hogan.

Front-Line Worker Hazard Pay and Educator Bonuses

Vermont provided hazard pay to front-line workers who performed essential services during the early stages of the pandemic. Educators in several states, including Florida, Michigan, and Tennessee, have received bonuses in recognition of their efforts.

"Our front-line workers and educators deserve our gratitude and support," said DeSantis.

Federal Stimulus Checks Reduced Hardships

The first three rounds of federal stimulus checks provided significant financial relief to millions of Americans. However, current federal proposals do not include additional direct payments.

"The stimulus checks helped reduce financial hardships and boosted the economy," said Yellen. "We will continue to monitor the economic situation and consider further measures as needed."
