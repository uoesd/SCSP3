Trump Impeachment Defense Accuses Democrats of 'Hatred,' Claims Speech Was Protected

WASHINGTON (AP) – Donald Trump's impeachment lawyers on Friday accused Democrats of a campaign of "hatred" against him, arguing that his speech before the Jan. 6 insurrection was ordinary political rhetoric and that he did not incite the riot.

The defense, led by Michael van der Veen, presented a three-hour argument that focused on drawing equivalences between Trump's words and those of Democrats, using video clips to show that similar language had been used by other politicians without leading to violence.

"This is a political prosecution," van der Veen said. "This is not a criminal prosecution."

Van der Veen argued that Trump's encouragement to "fight like hell" was not meant to undermine the election results, but rather to motivate his supporters to fight for their beliefs. He said that Trump had a right to dispute the election results, and that the violence that occurred on Jan. 6 was planned independently of his speech.

"The violence was not spontaneous," van der Veen said. "It was planned and executed by a small group of individuals who had their own motives."

The defense maintained that Trump's actions and speech were protected under the First Amendment, countering Democrats' portrayal of him as the "inciter in chief."

"The First Amendment protects the right to criticize the government, even in strong terms," van der Veen said. "President Trump's speech on January 6th was protected speech."

Democrats, however, argued that Trump's months-long campaign to question the election results laid the groundwork for the Capitol riot. They said that his repeated claims that the election was stolen had created a climate of distrust and anger that led to the violence.

"President Trump's words and actions incited the violence that occurred on January 6th," said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the lead impeachment manager. "He is responsible for the attack on our democracy."

Senators, particularly Democrats, reacted with amusement or dismissed the defense's comparisons as distractions.

"The defense's attempt to equate President Trump's speech with the speech of other politicians is a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that President Trump's speech was unique in its煽动性," said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).

Questions from senators after the argument included skepticism from Republicans about the defense's portrayal of Trump's actions.

"I'm not sure I agree with your characterization of President Trump's speech as protected speech," said Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah). "I think there's a difference between criticizing the government and inciting violence."

The Senate is moving towards a final vote and likely acquittal of Trump. A two-thirds majority is needed for conviction, and it is unlikely that 17 Republicans will join all 50 Democrats in voting to convict.

The defense used less than three of their allotted 16 hours, focusing on drawing equivalences between Trump's words and those of Democrats. Democrats are expected to use their remaining time to present a more detailed case against Trump, arguing that he is responsible for the violence that occurred on Jan. 6.
