Biden Vows Retribution After Kabul Airport Attack, Pledges Continued Evacuation Mission

My fellow Americans,

Today, our hearts are heavy with grief and anger as we mourn the tragic loss of American service members and civilians in the terrorist attack at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. This heinous act of violence, perpetrated by ISIS-K, has left an immeasurable void in the lives of countless families and cast a dark shadow over our nation.

As your President, I have been in constant contact with our military commanders on the ground, and the situation remains fluid. Our brave service members are working tirelessly to secure the airport and ensure the safe evacuation of American citizens and Afghan allies.

In the face of this unspeakable tragedy, we must remember the extraordinary heroism of our fallen and wounded service members. They were part of a significant evacuation effort that has seen over 100,000 individuals airlifted out of Afghanistan in the last 11 days. Their unwavering commitment to their mission and the safety of others is a testament to the indomitable spirit of our armed forces.

To the families of the fallen, I extend my deepest condolences. Your loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our nation, and their memory will forever be etched in the annals of American history. We owe them an eternal debt of gratitude.

We will not be deterred by this cowardly attack. We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt down the perpetrators and make them pay. I have ordered the development of operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. We will use all the resources at our disposal to bring justice to the victims and their families.

Despite this setback, our mission to evacuate American citizens and Afghan allies will continue. We have a moral obligation to those who have stood by our side and fought alongside us for the past 20 years. We will not abandon them in their time of need.

As we navigate this difficult chapter in our history, let us draw strength from the resilience and unity that has always defined our nation. In the face of adversity, we have always emerged stronger. We will not allow terrorism to divide us or undermine our resolve.

In memory of those who have given their lives in service, I ask all Americans to join me in a moment of silence.

May God bless our fallen heroes, their families, and our great nation.
