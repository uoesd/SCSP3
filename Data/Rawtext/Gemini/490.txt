Hurricane Ida Batters Louisiana and Mississippi, Leaving Hundreds of Thousands Without Power

More than 850,000 homes and businesses in Louisiana and Mississippi are without power after Hurricane Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, as a Category 4 storm on Sunday.

Ida brought 150 mph winds and weakened into a tropical storm as it moved inland. The hurricane was fed by warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, intensifying rapidly before making landfall.

Satellite imagery shows the storm's impact as it made landfall, with widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. Over 16 inches of rain fell in parts of Louisiana, causing significant flooding.

New Orleans' flood-protection system, enhanced after Hurricane Katrina, prevented catastrophic flooding in the city. However, satellite images before the storm showed Grand Isle, Louisiana, submerged due to heavy rains.

Ida is the ninth named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. Officials ordered evacuations along the coast, warning that some areas may be uninhabitable for weeks.

The storm's impact is still being assessed, but it is clear that Hurricane Ida has caused widespread damage and disruption in Louisiana and Mississippi. Recovery efforts are underway, and officials are urging residents to remain cautious and follow safety guidelines.
