Biden Unveils Comprehensive Plan to Combat COVID-19, Mandating Vaccinations and Enhancing Safety Measures

My fellow Americans,

As we navigate the ongoing battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, we find ourselves at a critical juncture. The emergence of the highly contagious Delta variant has necessitated a renewed and comprehensive approach to safeguarding our nation's health and well-being.

Today, I am announcing a bold and multifaceted plan that will strengthen our defenses against this relentless virus. This plan is guided by the unwavering principles of science, equity, and economic recovery.

Vaccination Mandates: A Vital Step for Public Health

At the heart of our strategy lies the imperative to increase vaccination rates. Vaccines remain our most powerful weapon against COVID-19, preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death. To accelerate the pace of vaccination, we will implement a series of mandates that will significantly expand the number of vaccinated individuals in our workplaces and communities.

Effective immediately, all employers with 100 or more employees will be required to ensure that their workforce is fully vaccinated or tested weekly. This mandate covers approximately 80 million workers and represents a major step forward in protecting our workplaces and the broader economy.

Leading companies across the nation, including United Airlines, Disney, Tyson Foods, and Fox News, have already recognized the importance of vaccination requirements. Their actions serve as a testament to the growing consensus among businesses that vaccination is essential for maintaining a safe and productive work environment.

Furthermore, we will require vaccinations for all workers in healthcare facilities that receive Medicare or Medicaid funding. This mandate will impact approximately 17 million healthcare workers, ensuring that the individuals entrusted with our care are fully protected.

Federal Leadership: Setting an Example for the Nation

The federal government will lead by example by mandating vaccination for all federal employees and contractors who do business with the federal government. This requirement will apply to approximately 2.1 million individuals, sending a clear message that vaccination is a non-negotiable condition for serving our nation.

Protecting Our Schools: Keeping Students and Staff Safe

The safety of our children and educators is paramount. We must do everything in our power to ensure that schools remain open and safe for in-person learning. To this end, I urge all governors to require vaccinations for all teachers and staff in K-12 schools and higher education institutions.

Expanding Testing: Making Testing More Accessible and Affordable

Testing remains a crucial tool for identifying and isolating infected individuals, thereby preventing the spread of the virus. We will significantly expand testing capacity and make testing more accessible and affordable for all Americans.

I am directing the use of the Defense Production Act to boost the production of rapid tests, ensuring that these tests are widely available and affordable. We will also establish new testing sites in underserved communities, ensuring equitable access to testing for all.

Supporting Small Businesses: Bolstering Economic Recovery

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on small businesses, which are the backbone of our economy. To support these businesses and accelerate our economic recovery, we will expand the COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, providing additional financial assistance to small businesses struggling to stay afloat.

Improving Care for COVID-19 Patients: Enhancing Treatment and Equity

We will continue to improve care for those who contract COVID-19. We will increase the distribution of monoclonal antibody treatments, which have proven effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization.

We will also work to ensure equity in vaccine distribution, addressing disparities in vaccination rates among different racial and ethnic groups.

Conclusion: A Call to Action for a Healthier Future

My fellow Americans, the fight against COVID-19 is not over. But with this comprehensive plan, we can turn the tide and emerge from this pandemic stronger than ever before.

I urge all Americans to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Vaccination is the single most important step we can take to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities.

I call on businesses, schools, and healthcare facilities to implement vaccination requirements and follow the guidance outlined in this plan.

Together, we can build a healthier and more resilient nation. Together, we can defeat COVID-19 and secure a brighter future for all Americans.

Thank you, and may God bless the United States of America.
