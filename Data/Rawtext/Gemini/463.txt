Prince Harry Returns to UK for Prince Philip's Funeral, Pays Heartfelt Tribute

Prince Harry has returned to the United Kingdom to attend the funeral of his grandfather, Prince Philip, who passed away on April 9th at the age of 99. The Duke of Sussex is currently staying at Frogmore Cottage, his former residence on the grounds of Windsor Castle, and is following all necessary COVID-19 protocols.

Harry's wife, Meghan Markle, did not accompany him on this trip due to her pregnancy. The couple had announced in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that they are expecting a baby girl this summer.

In a statement released on Monday, Prince Harry paid a touching tribute to his grandfather, fondly recalling his sense of humor, unwavering service, and unwavering honor. He described Prince Philip as a "master of the barbecue, a legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end."

Harry's statement also included a personal note, expressing that Prince Philip will be "sorely missed but always remembered" by Meghan, their son Archie, and their unborn daughter.

Prince William, Harry's brother, also issued a statement this morning, remembering their grandfather as "an extraordinary man and part of an extraordinary generation."

Harry's tribute to Prince Philip was particularly poignant, reflecting the close bond they shared. He referred to him affectionately as "Grandpa," highlighting his playful and endearing nature.

Prince Philip's legacy will be remembered for his long service to the Crown, being the longest reigning consort to the Monarch in British history. His unwavering devotion to Queen Elizabeth, his dedication to his duties, and his commitment to various charitable causes will forever be etched in the annals of history.

Harry's tribute concluded with a note of thanks and the phrase "Per Mare, Per Terram," the motto of the Royal Marines, of which Prince Philip was Captain General. This phrase, meaning "By Sea, By Land," symbolizes the unwavering service and dedication that Prince Philip embodied throughout his life.

As the nation mourns the loss of a beloved figure, Prince Harry's heartfelt tribute serves as a poignant reminder of the enduring legacy of Prince Philip, a man who will be remembered for his unwavering spirit, infectious humor, and unwavering commitment to his family and country.
