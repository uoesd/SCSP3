Biden Visits Hurricane-Ravaged Louisiana, Pledges Infrastructure Upgrades

President Joe Biden visited Louisiana on Friday to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Ida, which has left a trail of destruction across the state and the East Coast.

Biden's visit included meetings with Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards and local officials to discuss the hurricane's impact and the ongoing recovery efforts.

"The devastation is incredible," Biden said during a press conference in LaPlace, one of the communities hit hardest by Ida. "The storm surge was so powerful, it moved buildings off their foundations."

Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana on Sunday as a Category 4 hurricane, bringing with it powerful winds and torrential rain. The storm left one million people without power and another 600,000 without water in Louisiana.

Ida is the fifth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, causing extensive damage and power outages. The death toll from Hurricane Ida includes at least nine in Louisiana and at least 46 along the East Coast.

Power restoration efforts in Louisiana have reduced the number of homes and businesses without power to around 823,000. However, many communities are still struggling with widespread damage and a lack of essential services.

"We're working around the clock to get the power back on and restore water service," Edwards said. "But it's going to take time."

New Jersey's death toll from Ida's impacts rose to 25 on Friday, with at least six people still missing. Governor Phil Murphy said the state is "still in the midst of a recovery operation."

"We're grateful for the federal assistance that has been provided," Murphy said. "But we need more help."

Biden toured damage in Louisiana communities such as LaPlace and emphasized the need for infrastructure improvements to prevent future outages.

"We need to make sure that our infrastructure is resilient to these kinds of storms," Biden said. "We need to bury power lines underground, and we need to build stronger levees."

Biden's infrastructure plan includes investments in burying power lines underground to prevent future outages. The plan also includes funding for levee improvements and other measures to protect against flooding.

Biden approved an emergency declaration for New Jersey and New York on Thursday, providing federal assistance for response efforts. The declaration authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide financial assistance for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and other eligible expenses.

"We're going to be with you every step of the way," Biden said to the people of Louisiana and New Jersey. "We're not going to leave you behind."

U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) said Biden's visit was a "welcome sign of support" for Louisiana.

"The people of Louisiana are resilient," Cassidy said. "But we need the federal government's help to rebuild."

The recovery from Hurricane Ida is expected to be a long and challenging process. But with the support of the federal government and the resilience of the people affected, Louisiana and New Jersey will rebuild and recover.
