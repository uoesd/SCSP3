Queen Elizabeth II's Monarchy-First Approach Amidst Royal Drama

Queen Elizabeth II's unwavering commitment to the monarchy has been a defining characteristic of her reign, even in the face of family drama. As revealed in royal author Matthew Dennison's new book, "The Queen: A Life of Service," the Queen prioritized the institution over personal matters, including the departure of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

"The Queen was hurt and disappointed by Harry and Meghan's decision to leave," Dennison writes. "But she understood that they had to make their own choices."

Despite her personal feelings, the Queen maintained a monarchy-first mindset. Her official statement expressed hope for Harry and Meghan's peaceful new life, reflecting a focus on control and damage limitation.

"The Queen's actions were not sentimental but rather a reflection of her understanding of her duty," Dennison explains. "She believed that Harry and Meghan had to make a clean break from royal duties in order to preserve the integrity of the monarchy."

Elizabeth's approach has been consistent with her father's beliefs, which emphasized service and duty above all else. "The Queen has always put the monarchy and its mission of service first," Dennison says. "This does not mean that she does not love and support Harry and Meghan, which she has demonstrated several times since their departure."

For those less familiar with royal dynamics, Dennison emphasizes the importance of full commitment to royal duties. "The monarchy is a 24/7 job," he explains. "It requires a level of sacrifice and dedication that not everyone is willing to make."
