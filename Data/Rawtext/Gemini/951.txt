House Democrats Forge Ahead with Impeachment as Senate Trial Looms

In the aftermath of the violent Capitol insurrection, House Democrats are swiftly moving towards impeaching President Trump for a second time, citing his role in inciting the attack as an "imminent threat" to democracy and the Constitution.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a letter to colleagues, outlined the plan, stating, "The President's dangerous and seditious acts necessitate our urgent action." She added, "We must hold him accountable for his actions and prevent him from doing further harm to our democracy."

The impeachment effort includes two parallel tracks: adopting a resolution under the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office and drafting articles of impeachment accusing him of inciting violence against the U.S. government.

Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer attempted to contact Vice President Pence to discuss the 25th Amendment resolution but were unable to connect. The resolution, introduced by Rep. Jamie Raskin, would declare Trump "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office" and transfer power to Pence.

"We have made clear to the Vice President that we believe that the President has committed an impeachable offense and that we believe he should be removed from office," Pelosi said.

Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee has drafted impeachment charges against Trump, aiming for a vote as early as Wednesday. The charges allege that Trump "incited an insurrection against the United States" by encouraging his supporters to march on the Capitol and overturn the results of the election.

"The President of the United States summoned a mob to Washington, D.C., and ultimately spurred that mob to wage a violent assault on our democracy," said Rep. James Clyburn, the House Majority Whip.

The impeachment articles are expected to be sent to the Senate for a trial, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that it likely wouldn't start before President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20th. This could potentially affect Biden's early agenda and the confirmation of his cabinet nominees.

Biden has not publicly taken a stand on impeachment, instead focusing on his upcoming agenda and the transition to his administration.

Some Republicans, including Sen. Ben Sasse, have expressed openness to impeachment. "If the President has committed an impeachable offense, we should follow the process laid out in the Constitution," Sasse said.

However, other Republicans, including McConnell, have remained silent on the issue since the attack. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she is "considering all options," while Sen. Pat Toomey said he is "reviewing the evidence."

"I'm not going to make a judgment until I've had a chance to look at all the facts," Toomey said.

Sen. Roy Blunt said he believes the 25th Amendment is "not the right path" and that impeachment "would be a mistake."

In addition to impeachment, lawmakers are also considering censuring Trump and taking action against GOP objectors of Electoral College votes, including possible expulsion.

"We must hold those who incited this insurrection accountable," said Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton.

Sen. Josh Hawley, who objected to the Electoral College results, said he is "not afraid" of being expelled. Sen. Ted Cruz, another objector, said he is "not going to be intimidated by the left."

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said he believes the Senate should "expel every single member who voted to overturn the election." Sen. Chris Coons said he supports censuring Trump but is "not sure" about expulsion.

"We need to make sure that we are not dividing the country further," Coons said.

Rep. Cori Bush said she believes Trump should be "removed from office immediately."

"He is a danger to our democracy," Bush said.

The impeachment process and the potential Senate trial are expected to be highly contentious and could further divide the country. However, Democrats are determined to hold Trump accountable for his actions and prevent him from causing further harm to the nation.
