Senate Votes 57-43 to Acquit Trump in Second Impeachment Trial

The Senate voted 57-43 on Saturday to acquit former President Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial, with 43 Republican senators voting not to convict. The vote fell short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction.

Some senators who voted against conviction argued that the House managers had not proven their case. Others believed that the Senate lacked jurisdiction to try a former president, despite the House managers' arguments that the Constitution allowed for such a trial. A number of senators did not express their view on the merits of the case, but also cited lack of jurisdiction.

It is technically incorrect to consider some of the 43 votes as a vote to "acquit" based on questions of guilt or innocence. Over half of the 43 senators were critical of Trump or were neutral regarding his guilt or innocence. An overwhelming majority of the 100 senators who considered guilt or innocence voted to convict.

"We have a former president who incited an insurrection against the United States government," said Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE). "We have a former president who continues to make statements that are undermining our democracy."

Coons suggested that further accountability for Trump could be pursued through other means, such as a criminal trial or disqualification from holding future office. The explanations given by the 43 Republican senators might indicate their openness to future legislative actions against Trump.
