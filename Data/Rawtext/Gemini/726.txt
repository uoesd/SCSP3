Oakland County Prosecutor Defends Charging Parents of Oxford High School Shooter

Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald has faced criticism for her decision to charge the parents of the accused Oxford High School shooter with involuntary manslaughter. However, McDonald has defended her decision, emphasizing that it was made after careful consideration and is in the best interests of justice.

"This was not a political decision," McDonald told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly. "This was a decision based on the facts and the law."

The charges against James and Jennifer Crumbley stem from the November 30 shooting at Oxford High School, which resulted in the deaths of four students and multiple injuries. The Crumbleys are accused of failing to properly secure their son's gun, which he allegedly used to carry out the attack.

According to McDonald, there were numerous warning signs that the Crumbleys should have heeded. Jennifer Crumbley had posted on social media about buying a gun for her son just days before the shooting. The Crumbleys were also called to school on the day of the shooting due to their son's alarming writings, but they did not inform the school that he had access to a weapon.

"They had every reason to know that their son was dangerous and that he had access to a gun," McDonald said. "They failed to take reasonable steps to prevent him from using that gun to harm others."

James Crumbley called 911 after the shooting, suspecting that his son was the shooter. However, McDonald argues that this does not absolve the Crumbleys of responsibility.

"They had a duty to prevent this tragedy from happening," McDonald said. "They failed in that duty, and they must be held accountable."

McDonald's decision to charge the Crumbleys has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised her for taking a tough stance on gun violence, while others have criticized her for overreaching.

McDonald acknowledges that the case is complex and emotionally charged. However, she believes that it is important to send a message that gun owners have a responsibility to keep their weapons out of the hands of those who could use them to harm others.

"We cannot afford to wait for another school shooting to happen before we take action," McDonald said. "We need to do everything we can to prevent these tragedies from happening in the first place."

McDonald's decision to charge the Crumbleys is part of a concerted effort to minimize the focus on the shooter and avoid notoriety for such acts. She believes that this approach will help to prevent copycat shootings and reduce the likelihood of future tragedies.

"We need to stop glorifying these shooters," McDonald said. "We need to focus on the victims and their families. We need to work together to create a safer community for our children."

McDonald acknowledges that the case has taken an emotional toll on her and her staff. However, she is determined to see it through to the end.

"This is a difficult case," McDonald said. "But it is also an important case. We owe it to the victims and their families to seek justice."
