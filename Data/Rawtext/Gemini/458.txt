Sussexes Mark Archie's Birthday with Vaccine Equity Advocacy

London – Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have marked their son Archie's second birthday by advocating for global COVID-19 vaccine equity.

Through their charitable organization, Archewell, the couple has partnered with Global Citizen and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to support vaccine donations. For every $5 donation, a number of organizations will contribute $15, enough to cover four vaccine doses.

"We cannot think of a more resonant way to honor our son's birthday than to join with you in supporting the equitable distribution of vaccines," Harry and Meghan said in a statement.

The Sussexes highlighted the stark global disparity in vaccine distribution, with 80% of doses administered in wealthier nations. They emphasized the importance of global solidarity and compassion in overcoming the pandemic.

"We believe it is critical that our global response to the pandemic prioritizes the equitable distribution of vaccines, so that everyone, everywhere has fair access to this life-saving treatment," the statement read.

Archewell is collaborating with Global Citizen and Gavi to promote worldwide vaccine access. The organizations are calling on individuals, corporations, and governments to support the COVAX initiative, which aims to ensure equitable vaccine access for lower-income countries.

Harry and Meghan have also sent an open letter to pharmaceutical companies, urging more support for COVAX. They called on the companies to share their technology and intellectual property to increase vaccine production and distribution.

"We believe that the pharmaceutical industry has a critical role to play in ensuring that everyone, everywhere has access to vaccines," the letter stated.

The Sussexes acknowledged the support and acts of charity from the public in honor of Archie's previous birthdays. They expressed their gratitude for the donations and encouraged continued support for vaccine equity.

Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Sussexes would match donations. Multiple organizations, not the Sussexes themselves, will match donations.
