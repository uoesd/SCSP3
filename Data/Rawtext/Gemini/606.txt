Harris Swears In New Senators, Marking Historic Role in Senate

Washington, D.C. - Vice President Kamala Harris made history on Wednesday as she swore in three new Democratic senators, marking her first presiding role in the Senate. The swearing-in ceremony solidified the Democratic majority in the Senate, with Harris' tiebreaking vote giving Democrats an edge.

"It is an honor to swear in these three new senators," Harris said. "Their presence here today is a testament to the strength of our democracy and the diversity of our nation."

The three new senators sworn in were Alex Padilla of California, Raphael Warnock of Georgia, and Jon Ossoff of Georgia. Their victories in the January 5 runoff elections gave Democrats a 50-50 split in the Senate, with Harris' tiebreaking vote making Charles E. Schumer the Senate majority leader.

"With Vice President Harris as our tiebreaker, we now have the ability to pass legislation that will make a real difference in the lives of the American people," Schumer said. "We will work to lower costs for families, create jobs, and protect our environment."

Vermont Democrat Patrick J. Leahy resumed his role as Senate president pro tempore, the third-ranking position in the Senate. Leahy has served in the Senate since 1975 and is the longest-serving senator from Vermont.

"I am honored to serve as president pro tempore of the Senate," Leahy said. "I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address the challenges facing our nation."

Both Schumer and McConnell are now negotiating the power dynamics for the minority party in the Senate. McConnell has called for a power-sharing agreement that would give Republicans equal representation on committees, but Schumer has rejected that proposal.

"We are committed to working with our Republican colleagues in a bipartisan way," Schumer said. "But we will not sacrifice our values or our priorities."

McConnell called for finding common ground for the common good between both parties.

"We have a responsibility to the American people to find ways to work together," McConnell said. "We must put the interests of the country ahead of our own political interests."

In addition to the swearing-in of the new senators, the Senate also confirmed Avril Haines as director of national intelligence. Haines was confirmed by a vote of 84-10, with all but one Republican voting against her.

"I am honored to be confirmed as director of national intelligence," Haines said. "I look forward to working with the intelligence community to protect our national security."

Haines' confirmation was briefly held up by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who objected to her nomination over concerns about her views on China. However, Cotton eventually withdrew his objection, allowing Haines to be confirmed.

The swearing-in of Harris, Padilla, Warnock, and Ossoff marks a historic moment for women in American politics. Harris is the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice president, while Pelosi is the first woman to serve as speaker of the House.

"This is a historic moment for our country," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. "We have more women serving in the Senate and the House than ever before."

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., echoed Feinstein's sentiments.

"This is a testament to the progress that we have made as a country," Klobuchar said. "We are finally starting to see women take their rightful place in leadership."

The swearing-in of the new senators and the confirmation of Haines sets the stage for a busy and consequential year in the Senate. Democrats will be looking to pass their legislative agenda, while Republicans will be looking to block it. However, both parties will need to find ways to work together in order to address the challenges facing the country.
