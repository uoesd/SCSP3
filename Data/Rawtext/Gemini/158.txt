Colin Powell: A Statesman with a Wrench in His Hand

Colin Powell, the esteemed statesman and four-star general, found solace and fulfillment not only in the halls of power but also in the humble confines of his garage. A self-proclaimed "gearhead," Powell's passion for fixing cars, especially vintage models, was a testament to his frugality, curiosity, and unwavering belief in the power of repair over discard.

"He was a guy who could fix anything," recalled Richard Armitage, a longtime friend and deputy secretary of state. "He had a real knack for it."

Powell's mechanical prowess extended beyond automobiles. At his memorial service, his son Michael recounted an incident where his father meticulously fixed a batch of defective adding machines, much to the astonishment of his colleagues.

"He was always trying to figure out how things worked," said Michael Powell. "He had a real thirst for knowledge."

Powell's career trajectory was as remarkable as his mechanical abilities. A swift rise through the military ranks culminated in his appointment as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he formulated the "Powell doctrine," a set of principles that emphasized overwhelming force and clear objectives in military operations.

However, Powell's tenure as secretary of state under George W. Bush was marked by a dilemma that tested his adherence to his own doctrine. The decision to invade Iraq, based on faulty intelligence about Saddam Hussein's illicit weapons, contradicted the Powell doctrine's emphasis on certainty and overwhelming force.

"It was a very difficult time for him," said Peggy Cifrino, Powell's longtime assistant. "He knew that the intelligence was not as solid as it should have been."

Powell's regret over his UN speech that falsely claimed Hussein had illicit weapons haunted him for the rest of his life. He considered it the biggest mistake of his career.

After leaving the Bush administration, Powell remained influential, advising foreign diplomats and leaders, and engaging in private sector and educational activities. He was a sought-after speaker and author, sharing his insights on leadership, diplomacy, and the challenges facing the world.

In his later years, Powell battled multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow. He underwent treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center until his last days.

Even as secretary of state, Powell found solace in tinkering in his garage. The tangible results of his mechanical endeavors contrasted with the complexities and uncertainties of foreign policy.

"He loved the fact that he could fix something and see the results right away," said Armitage. "It was a way for him to escape the pressures of his job."

Powell's passion for mechanics was not merely a hobby; it was a reflection of his character. His frugality, curiosity, and drive to repair rather than discard extended beyond his garage to his approach to life and leadership.

"He was a man who believed in the power of hard work, determination, and the importance of always striving to do better," said Michael Powell. "He was a true American hero, and we will miss him dearly."

Colin Powell's legacy extends far beyond his accomplishments in the military and diplomacy. His love for fixing things, whether cars or complex international issues, serves as a reminder of the importance of perseverance, ingenuity, and the belief that even the most daunting challenges can be overcome.
