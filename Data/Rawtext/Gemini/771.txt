Fatal 'Rust' Shooting Exposes Film Industry's Safety and Labor Crisis

The tragic death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western film "Rust" has cast a spotlight on the ongoing safety and labor concerns that plague the film industry. The incident, in which actor and producer Alec Baldwin discharged a prop gun that killed Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza, has raised serious questions about workplace safety negligence and the broader labor disputes that have been simmering within the industry.

Safety Concerns and Broken Promises

According to reports, workers on the "Rust" set had raised concerns about safety issues, including the use of real guns and the lack of proper safety protocols. These concerns were allegedly ignored by production management, leading to the fatal accident.

In addition to safety concerns, workers on "Rust" were also dealing with broken promises regarding housing and excessive work hours. These factors contributed to an unsafe and stressful working environment that may have played a role in the tragedy.

IATSE Labor Disputes and Strike Threat

The "Rust" incident occurred against the backdrop of broader labor disputes within the film industry. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), which represents over 150,000 workers in the industry, has been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) for months over demands for better working conditions, including longer breaks, higher wages, and improved safety protocols.

A tentative agreement was reached in October that could avert a strike, but IATSE members are still reviewing the details and could reject the deal if they deem it insufficient. The possibility of a countrywide IATSE strike looms, which would have a significant impact on the film and television industry.

Resurgence in Labor Militancy

The labor unrest in the film industry is part of a broader resurgence in labor militancy across various sectors. At least 40 U.S. strikes are currently in progress, with new strikes anticipated across different industries.

"Workers are fed up with being treated like cogs in a machine," said Sara Nelson, International President of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA. "They're demanding better pay, better benefits, and safer working conditions."

Strikes and Labor Actions

Specific strikes and labor actions include:

  • Piedmont Airlines flight attendants are on strike for better pay and working conditions.
  • Healthcare workers at Kaiser Permanente in California are striking for higher wages and improved staffing levels.
  • Workers at Kellogg's and John Deere continue to strike, with both companies attempting to break strikes through hiring strikebreakers and other means.

Independent Action and Systemic Change

Workers are demonstrating their power through strikes and labor actions independently of legislative solutions. This reflects a broader call for systemic changes in labor rights, including the right to organize, bargain collectively, and earn a living wage.

The resurgence in labor militancy is a sign that workers are no longer willing to tolerate low wages, poor working conditions, and the erosion of their rights. It is a reminder that the fight for workers' rights is an ongoing struggle that requires collective action and solidarity.
