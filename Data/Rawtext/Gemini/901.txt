Buccaneers Finalize 53-Man Roster with Surprising Linebacker Depth

TAMPA, Fla. - The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have finalized their initial 53-man roster for the 2021 season, featuring a surprising emphasis on linebackers and a strong core of returning veterans.

Linebacker-Heavy Defense

Head coach Bruce Arians has opted for a linebacker-heavy defense, retaining 10 linebackers on the roster. "We've got a lot of guys who can play multiple positions," Arians explained. "We want to be able to mix and match and keep the offense guessing."

Draft Picks Make the Cut

Six of the Buccaneers' seven 2021 draft picks have made the roster, including first-round outside linebacker Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, who is expected to contribute immediately in the edge rotation. Seventh-round cornerback Chris Wilcox was the only draft pick not to make the cut.

Undrafted Rookie Kicker

Jose Borregales, an undrafted rookie kicker from Miami, has earned a spot on the roster. He will compete with veteran Ryan Succop, who is expected to return from the COVID list.

Notable Veterans

The Buccaneers' roster boasts a number of notable veterans, including quarterback Tom Brady, running backs Giovani Bernard and Leonard Fournette, wide receiver Antonio Brown, and tight end Rob Gronkowski.

Trask Retained as Brady's Successor

Rookie quarterback Kyle Trask has been retained as a potential successor to Brady. "He's a smart kid with a lot of potential," Arians said. "We're excited to see what he can do."

Tight End Depth

The Buccaneers have retained three tight ends: Cameron Brate, Rob Gronkowski, and O.J. Howard. Brate and Howard are both coming off injuries, but Arians is confident they will be ready for the season opener.

Defensive Line Expansion

The Buccaneers' defensive line is expected to expand with the activation of Ndamukong Suh from the COVID list. Suh's presence will bolster a unit that already includes Vita Vea and Will Gholston.

Specialists

In addition to Borregales, the Buccaneers' specialists include long snapper Zach Triner and punter Bradley Pinion.

Arians on the Roster

"I'm really excited about this group of guys," Arians said. "We've got a lot of talent and experience, and I think we can be a special team."
