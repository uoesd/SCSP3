Harris and Emhoff Still Living Out of Suitcases at Blair House Amidst Prolonged Vice Presidential Residence Renovations

CNN – More than two months after her inauguration, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, continue to reside out of suitcases at Blair House due to ongoing renovations at the vice presidential residence.

The delay in Harris's move into the official residence, known as Number One Observatory Circle, has raised questions about the reasons behind the prolonged renovation period. The residence, a 9,000-plus square feet mansion built in 1893, has undergone substantial renovations and upkeep, involving government contracts for various works.

According to Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh, the renovations include "routine maintenance and repairs" but do not involve any major structural changes. However, Harris reportedly requested work on the kitchen, a request that Singh later clarified was not being carried out.

Historically, new vice presidents have delayed moving into the official residence to allow for maintenance and upgrades. However, the extended period of renovations has reportedly caused frustration for Harris.

"The vice president and the second gentleman are eager to move into their official residence," Singh said. "They are working closely with the General Services Administration (GSA) to ensure that the renovations are completed as soon as possible."

The temporary accommodations at Blair House, a historic mansion across from the White House, offer luxury but do not provide the casual, informal atmosphere that Harris and Emhoff prefer. The vice president's residence offers more privacy, fewer staff, and less formality compared to the White House.

Previous vice presidents have personalized the residence with unique features such as a heated pool and a horseshoe pit. Harris, who values fitness and cooking, looks forward to utilizing the residence's outdoor space and potentially personalizing it.

"The vice president's residence is a historic home that has been updated to meet the needs of modern vice presidents," said Elizabeth Haenle, former Vice President Residence Manager and Social Secretary for former Vice President Dick Cheney. "It is a comfortable and private space where the vice president and their family can live and work."

The GSA, which is responsible for managing federal properties, has not provided a specific timeline for the completion of the renovations. The agency has stated that it is working diligently to ensure that the residence is ready for Harris and Emhoff to move in as soon as possible.

In the meantime, Harris and Emhoff continue to reside at Blair House, where they have hosted official events and meetings. The couple is eager to move into their official residence, where they can establish a more permanent home and enjoy the privacy and amenities it offers.
