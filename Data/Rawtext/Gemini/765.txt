Hollywood's Long-Standing Affair with Guns: 'Rust' Tragedy Sparks Safety Debate

The tragic shooting on the set of "Rust," resulting in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, has ignited a long-overdue debate on the use of guns in film production. Hollywood's enduring relationship with firearms, dating back to the 1903 film "The Great Train Robbery," has come under scrutiny, with many calling for stricter safety measures and the elimination of live fire on sets.

The 'Rust' Tragedy and Its Aftermath

The accidental shooting on the set of "Rust" has sent shockwaves through the industry. Alec Baldwin, who fired the gun that killed Hutchins, has expressed deep remorse and has pledged to work tirelessly to prevent such tragedies from happening again. The incident has prompted a reevaluation of safety protocols and a renewed focus on the well-being of cast and crew.

Calls for Eliminating Live Fire

In the wake of the "Rust" tragedy, many industry professionals have advocated for the elimination of live fire on sets. Rachel Morrison, the cinematographer of "Black Panther," believes that "there is no reason to have live fire on a set." She argues that technological alternatives, such as airsoft guns and CGI, can effectively simulate gunfire without the inherent risks.

Technological Alternatives Gaining Traction

Following the "Rust" tragedy, some productions have begun relying on airsoft guns and CGI to simulate gunfire. Airsoft guns fire plastic pellets, significantly reducing the risk of serious injury. CGI can also be used to create realistic muzzle flashes and bullet impacts, enhancing the visual impact without compromising safety.

'The Rookie' Leads the Way

ABC's "The Rookie" has become a pioneer in eliminating the use of live weapons on set. Showrunner Alexi Hawley believes that "the safety of our cast and crew is paramount." The production has opted for airsoft guns and CGI to simulate gunfire, setting an example for other productions to follow.

Legislative Action on the Horizon

California State Senator Dave Cortese has announced plans to introduce legislation banning live ammunition and firearms on movie and theatrical production sets. The bill, if passed, would make California the first state to implement such a ban.

IATSE Pushes for Safety Measures

The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) is pushing for improved safety measures amid contract negotiations with studios. The union is demanding stricter gun safety protocols, including the elimination of live ammunition and the use of trained armorers.

Arguments for Banning Real Guns

Proponents of banning real guns from sets argue that it is a necessary step to prevent tragedies like the "Rust" shooting. They emphasize that live ammunition is inherently dangerous and that there is no justification for its use in film production.

Critics of a Total Ban

Critics of a total ban on real guns argue that guns capable of firing only blanks should not be completely prohibited if proper safety protocols are observed. They emphasize the importance of competence and training for armorers and weapons masters.

Armorers and Weapons Masters Speak Out

Dan Frenkel, a cinematographer and armorer, believes that "a blanket ban on real guns is not the answer." He argues that "with proper training and safety procedures, blank guns can be used safely." Gary Truers, an armorer and weapons master on "Jurassic World," agrees, stating that "a well-trained armorer can make a blank gun as safe as a rubber chicken."

Advocates for CG Gun Effects

Advocates for CG gun effects argue that it not only enhances safety but also meets contemporary expectations of realism in filmmaking. Joe Henderson, co-showrunner of "Lucifer," believes that "CG gun effects can be just as effective as live fire, if not more so."

Conclusion

The "Rust" tragedy has sparked a long-overdue debate on the use of guns in film production. While some advocate for the elimination of live fire, others argue for the continued use of blank guns with strict safety protocols. The industry is grappling with the challenge of balancing safety and realism, and it remains to be seen how this debate will ultimately shape the future of filmmaking.
