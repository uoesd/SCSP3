Biden Administration Unveils Comprehensive Global COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Plan

President Joe Biden has reaffirmed the United States' unwavering commitment to ending the COVID-19 pandemic globally. Recognizing the interconnected nature of the crisis, the Biden administration has outlined a comprehensive plan to support global vaccine production and distribution, with a focus on equitable access for all.

The United States has pledged $4 billion to support COVAX, the global vaccine initiative, and is actively working to boost vaccine production capacity worldwide. Additionally, the administration supports the temporary waiver of intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines, recognizing the urgent need to expand vaccine availability.

To date, the United States has shared over 4 million vaccine doses with Canada and Mexico, and has pledged to share 80 million doses worldwide by the end of June. The first 25 million doses will be allocated globally, with at least 75% shared through COVAX. Approximately 19 million doses will be distributed to Latin America, the Caribbean, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa via COVAX. Over 6 million doses will be shared directly with countries in need, including Canada, Mexico, India, and the Republic of Korea.

The United States emphasizes that it is sharing vaccines without expecting favors or concessions in return. The goal is to save lives and end the pandemic, recognizing that global health security is essential for the well-being of all nations. President Biden has highlighted the role of strong American leadership in ending the pandemic and improving global health security.

The Biden administration will continue to monitor the global COVID-19 situation and announce future vaccine distribution plans as the United States continues to combat the spread of the virus. The administration remains committed to working with partners around the world to ensure equitable access to vaccines and end the pandemic for all.
