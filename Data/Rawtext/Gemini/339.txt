Ever Given Grounding Triggers Legal Storm Over General Average

The grounding of the Ever Given in the Suez Canal has ignited a legal and insurance dispute involving the principle of general average, a centuries-old maritime tradition that requires shippers to share losses.

General average is the equitable sharing of loss between vessel owners and cargo interests under the York Antwerp Rules. It can be invoked for various reasons beyond vessel fires or overboard containers, including salvage operations and seeking refuge.

In the case of the Ever Given, the vessel's owners, not Evergreen specifically, invoked general average for the incident. The move has sparked a legal battle over who should bear the costs of the salvage operation, which freed the vessel after six days.

"General average is a complex area of maritime law that can be difficult to understand," said Joe Klobus, Claims and Insurance Manager at OEC Group. "It's important for shippers to be aware of the potential implications of general average before entering into contracts."

The increasing frequency of incidents like containers falling overboard has made general average declarations more common. In 2021, there were 3,114 reported incidents of containers lost at sea, according to the World Shipping Council.

Evergreen, while not technically liable, faces a public and legal challenge regarding the financial implications of the blockade. The company has been criticized for its handling of the situation and could face lawsuits from shippers who suffered losses due to the delay.

The $900 million figure cited by Egyptian authorities includes various claims, with $300 million each for a salvage bonus and loss of reputation. The remaining $300 million is for other costs, including damage to the canal and lost revenue.

Vessels delayed due to the Ever Given's grounding likely cannot declare general average as delay doesn't fit within the York Antwerp Rules. However, they may be able to claim compensation from the vessel's owners or their insurers.

Shippers entering contracts should be aware of general average, though many may not understand its full implications. Klobus recommends that shippers seek legal advice before signing contracts that include general average clauses.

"General average can be a significant financial burden for shippers," Klobus said. "It's important to understand the risks involved and to take steps to mitigate those risks."

The Ever Given incident has highlighted the importance of general average in maritime law. As the shipping industry becomes more complex and globalized, general average disputes are likely to become more common.

Understanding General Average

General average is a maritime principle that dates back to the Middle Ages. It is based on the idea that all parties involved in a maritime venture should share the costs of any extraordinary sacrifices made for the common good.

The York Antwerp Rules, which were first adopted in 1890, codify the principles of general average. The rules have been updated several times over the years, most recently in 2016.

General average can be invoked for a variety of reasons, including:

  • Vessel fires
  • Overboard containers
  • Salvage operations
  • Seeking refuge

When general average is invoked, the vessel's owners appoint a general average adjuster to calculate the total cost of the loss. The adjuster then apportions the cost among the vessel owners and cargo interests based on the value of their respective interests.

Shippers can take steps to mitigate the risk of general average, such as:

  • Purchasing insurance
  • Negotiating contracts that limit their liability
  • Diversifying their cargo across multiple vessels

Impact on Consumer Prices

The Ever Given incident could have a ripple effect on consumer prices. The charges levied against the Ever Given and other ships could be rolled into landed costs, affecting the market.

"Consumers should be aware that the Ever Given incident could lead to higher prices for goods," Klobus said. "It's important to factor this into their budgeting decisions."

The Ever Given incident is a reminder of the importance of general average in maritime law. Shippers should be aware of the potential implications of general average before entering into contracts.
