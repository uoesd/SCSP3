'Rust' Executive Producer Defends Role Amid Safety Concerns

In the wake of the tragic shooting on the set of the Western film "Rust," executive producer Allen Cheney has defended his and Emily Salveson's involvement in the production, stating that their roles were limited to financial backing.

"Our involvement was purely as financiers," Cheney said in a statement. "We had no creative control over the production and were not involved in the day-to-day operations of the film."

Cheney's statement comes in response to criticism from the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), which accused the producers of hiring a non-union crew following a walkout by union members.

"We are deeply saddened by the tragic accident that occurred on the set of 'Rust,'" IATSE said in a statement. "Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Halyna Hutchins, and we wish Joel Souza a full and speedy recovery."

"However, we are deeply concerned about the reports that a non-union crew was hired after our members walked off the job," the statement continued. "This is a clear violation of our contract and puts the safety of our members at risk."

Cheney asserted that "Rust" is union-certified and in good standing with major production unions including IATSE, the Teamsters, SAG, and DGA. He said that the non-union crew members were hired only after union members had walked off the job.

"We understand that there are concerns about safety on film sets, and we are committed to working with all stakeholders to ensure that our productions are safe for everyone involved," Cheney said.

The tragic shooting on the "Rust" set occurred on October 21, when actor Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun that contained live ammunition, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. Assistant director Dave Halls handed Baldwin the weapon, believing it to be safe.

Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz emphasized the permanent damage caused by accidents on movie sets. "These are not just accidents," Koretz said. "They are preventable tragedies that have a lasting impact on the lives of the victims and their families."

Legal commentator Nancy Grace suggested that Baldwin could face charges of negligent homicide. "Baldwin is not a victim here," Grace said. "He is the one who pulled the trigger and killed someone."

The production of "Rust" has been halted pending a police investigation. The incident has sparked a conversation about safety protocols on film sets, with many calling for stricter regulations to prevent future tragedies.

Newsweek attempted to reach Allen Cheney for further comment, but he was not immediately available.
