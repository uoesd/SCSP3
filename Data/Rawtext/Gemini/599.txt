Harris Makes History as First Sitting Vice President to March in Pride Event

Washington, D.C. - Vice President Kamala Harris made history on Sunday by becoming the first sitting Vice President to march in a Pride event. Accompanied by Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, Harris participated in Capital Pride in Washington, D.C., donning a "love is love" t-shirt and delivering a brief speech advocating for the Equality Act.

Harris's participation in the Pride event underscores the Biden Administration's commitment to advancing LGBTQ rights. In her speech, she emphasized the importance of protecting the transgender community and youth, stating, "We must ensure that every person in our country is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of who they are or who they love."

The Vice President also took to Twitter to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub shooting, honoring the 49 people killed in the tragic event. She highlighted the Biden Administration's pledge to build a world free from gun violence, emphasizing the need to address the epidemic of mass shootings.

President Biden has announced that he will sign legislation to make the Pulse Nightclub a national memorial, a testament to the Administration's commitment to remembering the victims and preventing future tragedies.

The Biden Administration has prioritized LGBTQ issues since taking office, reversing several policies implemented by the previous administration. Biden's first executive orders included protections against discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation, and he has since appointed numerous LGBTQ individuals to key positions within the government.

Pride Month 2022 is being observed amid an uncertain time for the LGBTQ community. A record number of anti-LGBTQ bills are under consideration in state legislatures across the country, targeting transgender youth and restricting access to healthcare and other essential services.

Despite these challenges, the Biden Administration remains steadfast in its support for LGBTQ rights. Harris's historic participation in Capital Pride sends a powerful message of inclusion and equality, and serves as a reminder of the ongoing fight for justice and dignity for all.
