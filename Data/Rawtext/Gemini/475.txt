Meghan and Harry's Glamorous Return: A Night of Joy and Reflection

Amidst the glitz and glamour of a recent gala, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry reunited with their trusted wedding glam squad, rekindling the joyful camaraderie that marked their special day. Makeup artist Daniel Martin, a close friend of the couple, shared intimate details of their preparation in an exclusive interview with PEOPLE Royals.

"It was like a family reunion," Martin recounted. "We were all laughing and joking, and it was just so much fun to be together again."

The gala marked a significant moment for Meghan and Harry, who have embraced an active public life since stepping down as senior working royals. Their recent appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and a visit to New York City with Harry showcased their commitment to using their platform for good.

Their transition from the confines of the royal family to a financially independent life in California has been a transformative journey. They now enjoy the freedom to pursue their passions and raise their family of four, Archie and Lili, in a more private setting.

"They're really enjoying their life in California," Martin observed. "They're so happy and relaxed, and it's really nice to see."

While embracing their new life, Meghan and Harry remain committed to their work. Meghan has become a vocal advocate for paid parental leave in the United States, while Harry has dedicated himself to battling misinformation and disinformation.

"I think they're both really passionate about making a difference in the world," Martin said. "They're using their voices for good, and I think that's really admirable."

Harry has also been vocal about his criticism of the term "Megxit," which he believes perpetuates misogyny and unfairly targets Meghan.

"I think it's a misogynistic term," Harry told PEOPLE Royals. "It was created by a troll, and it was intended to be hurtful and derogatory."

As they navigate their second year of independence, Meghan and Harry continue to rely on each other for support. Their friend, hairstylist Serge Normant, described their bond as "unbreakable."

"They're inseparable," Normant said. "They're always together, and they're always supporting each other. It's really beautiful to see."

Through the ups and downs of their journey, Meghan and Harry have emerged stronger than ever. They have found a new path that allows them to balance their personal and professional lives, while making a meaningful impact on the world.
