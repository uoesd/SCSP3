Chicago-Based Strictly FX Illuminates Biden-Harris Inauguration with Spectacular Fireworks Display

Chicago, IL - Strictly FX, a Chicago-founded pyrotechnics company, orchestrated the dazzling fireworks display that illuminated the nation's capital during the Biden-Harris Inauguration Day celebration. The company, renowned for its expertise in pyrotechnics for rock shows and major events, relocated its headquarters to Nashville in 2018 but maintains operations in Chicago and California.

Adam Biscow, the designer from Strictly FX, emphasized the collaborative effort behind the show and the desire to create a memorable piece of history: "It was a team effort from the start. We wanted to create something that would be remembered for years to come."

The fireworks display utilized approximately 20,000 shells and was meticulously choreographed to Katy Perry's performance of "Firework." Two separate launch zones were strategically positioned to accommodate camera angles and protect the National Mall's delicate grass.

The aesthetic of the display was meticulously crafted to highlight the Washington Monument with vibrant colors and large bursts. "We wanted to make sure that the fireworks would complement the monument and create a truly unforgettable experience," Biscow explained.

A crew of 26 from Strictly FX and Garden State Fireworks meticulously set up the display, with planning commencing immediately after the November election. The fireworks were meticulously timed to launch precisely when Katy Perry reached a specific verse in the song, emphasizing the synchronization between the pyrotechnics and the musical performance.

Experts from the pyrotechnics industry lauded the display's execution and scale. Chris Santore, from Garden State Fireworks, commented, "It was one of the most complex and ambitious fireworks displays I've ever been a part of. The level of coordination and precision was truly remarkable."

Matt Peterson, a designer from Melrose Pyrotechnics, shared an anecdote about a canceled Obama election victory fireworks display: "We had a similar display planned for Obama's election victory in 2008, but it was canceled due to weather. It was great to finally see a display of this magnitude come to fruition."

The Biden-Harris Inauguration Day fireworks display showcased the artistry and technical prowess of Strictly FX, a Chicago-based company that has made its mark on the national stage. The display will undoubtedly be remembered as a symbol of hope, unity, and the enduring spirit of the American people.
