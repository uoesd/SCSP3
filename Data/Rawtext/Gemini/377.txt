Facebook, Google Slammed for Failing to Curb Scam Ads Despite User Reports

As online fraud surges amid global lockdowns, Facebook and Google are facing intense criticism for their ineffective efforts in combating scam ads on their platforms, even after users report them.

Surge in Online Fraud

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced people indoors, leading to a significant increase in online activity. This has created a fertile ground for scammers, who have exploited the situation to target vulnerable individuals with fraudulent advertisements.

Lax Approach by Facebook

Facebook has been particularly criticized for its lax approach to scam ads. A study by British consumer group Which? found that 34% of Google-reported scam ads were not removed, compared to 26% for Facebook-reported ads.

"Facebook has a responsibility to protect its users from harm, but it's failing to do so," said Adam French, consumer rights expert at Which?. "Scam ads are rife on the platform, and Facebook is not doing enough to remove them."

Scammers Impersonating Brands

Scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their tactics. They often create fake ads using established brands' logos and branding to steal financial details from unsuspecting consumers.

"Scammers are using the logos and branding of trusted companies to trick people into handing over their money," said French. "This is a serious problem that needs to be addressed."

Victims More Likely to Encounter Scams on Facebook

According to the Which? study, victims are more likely to come across fraudulent ads on Facebook than on Google. This is because Facebook has a larger user base and less stringent advertising policies.

Calls for Government Intervention

Consumer rights advocates are urging the UK government to introduce legislation to tackle the problem of online scams.

"The government needs to step in and regulate the online advertising industry," said French. "Tech companies must be held accountable for the content that appears on their platforms."

Proposed Online Safety Bill

The UK government is currently considering the Online Safety Bill, which could impose fines on tech companies that fail to remove "harmful" content from their platforms.

Tech Giants Respond

Facebook and Google have defended their efforts to combat scam ads.

"We take the issue of fraudulent activity very seriously and have invested heavily in proactive measures to fight it," said a Facebook spokesperson. "We have removed millions of scam ads from our platform and continue to work closely with law enforcement to bring scammers to justice."

"We have a dedicated team of experts who work around the clock to detect and remove scam ads," said a Google spokesperson. "We also provide users with tools to report suspicious ads, and we encourage them to do so."

Insider's Previous Reporting

Insider has previously reported on scammers using fake quotes from celebrities to promote fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes on YouTube. This highlights the broader problem of online fraud and the need for tech companies to take more aggressive action to address it.

Conclusion

Facebook and Google are facing increasing pressure to address the issue of scam ads on their platforms. The surge in online fraud during the pandemic has made this a critical issue that requires immediate attention. Consumer rights advocates are calling for government intervention, and the proposed Online Safety Bill could provide a framework for holding tech companies accountable for the content they host.
