Trump Raises Suspicions in Alec Baldwin Shooting Incident

Former President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by suggesting that Alec Baldwin's fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the 'Rust' set might have been intentional.

"I don't know why he would point a gun at a cinematographer instead of an actor," Trump said on a podcast hosted by Chris Stigall. "It's very strange."

The incident occurred in October when Baldwin fired a prop gun containing a live round, resulting in Hutchins's death. Authorities are still investigating the incident, and no charges have been filed against Baldwin, who has stated he is "fully cooperating" with the investigation.

Trump criticized Baldwin's character, referring to him as a "cuckoo-bird" and a "nutjob", and insinuated Baldwin may have had something to do with the incident.

"I don't like him," Trump said. "He's a nutjob. He's a cuckoo-bird."

Trump elaborated on his skepticism about the handling of the gun, questioning the rationale behind pointing a gun at someone not involved in the movie and pulling the trigger.

"Why would you point a gun at someone who's not even in the movie?" Trump asked. "It's very strange."

Baldwin had previously expressed his shock and sadness over the tragic event, emphasizing his sympathy for Hutchins's family and his willingness to support them.

"There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that happened on the set of 'Rust'," Baldwin said in a statement. "I am fully cooperating with the investigation to address how this tragedy occurred and I am committed to supporting the Hutchins family during this difficult time."

Following the incident, Baldwin has advocated for a police presence on movie and television sets to monitor firearms safety, a proposal made through a tweet from his art foundation.

"Every film/TV set that uses guns, fake or otherwise, should have a police officer on set to specifically monitor weapons safety," Baldwin tweeted.

Trump's comments have drawn criticism from some, who have accused him of being insensitive and disrespectful to the victims of the tragedy. Others have defended Trump's right to express his opinions, even if they are controversial.

Stigall, the host of the podcast on which Trump made the comments, said he was "surprised" by Trump's remarks but that he respected his right to voice them.

"I was surprised by what he said," Stigall said. "But I think he has the right to say it."

Baldwin has not publicly responded to Trump's comments.
