Marine Paralyzed in Kabul Airport Attack Recovering with Support of Community

DEARBORN COUNTY, Ind. (WXIX) – Marine Cpl. Kelsee Lainhart, a Dearborn County native, is recovering from injuries sustained in the Kabul Airport attack on Aug. 26.

Lainhart was among the service members involved in the withdrawal of U.S. troops and refugees during the final days of the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. Thirteen service members died in the attack.

Since the attack, Lainhart has undergone two surgeries and remains hospitalized. Her recovery journey has taken her from Walter Reed in Washington to Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago.

The Dearborn County community has rallied around Lainhart, organizing a T-shirt fundraiser through Sunman-Dearborn Community Schools. The shirts feature the words "Kelsee Strong" and have raised over $10,000 for her recovery.

"The support has been amazing," said Lainhart's mother, Kim. "We've received so many messages and prayers from people all over the country."

Due to the volume of support messages, Lainhart's parents have set up a P.O. box for people to send cards and letters.

Lainhart herself is overwhelmed by the support she has received. "I'm so grateful for everyone who has reached out to me," she said. "It means the world to me."

Despite her injuries, Lainhart does not regret her decision to join the Marines. "I always wanted to serve my country," she said. "I'm proud of what I did."

Lainhart is considering a post-military career, depending on her recovery progress. She is interested in working with veterans or in the medical field.

"I'm not sure what the future holds," she said. "But I know I'm going to keep fighting."

Lainhart's story is a reminder of the sacrifices made by our service members and the importance of community support. Her recovery journey is ongoing, but she is determined to overcome her injuries and live a full and meaningful life.
