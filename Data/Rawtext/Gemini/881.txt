Tiger Woods' Girlfriend Erica Herman a 'Rock' After His Devastating Car Crash

In the wake of Tiger Woods' horrific car accident, his girlfriend, Erica Herman, has emerged as a pillar of support, providing unwavering emotional solace during his arduous recovery.

According to an exclusive source, Herman has been "by Tiger's side constantly, offering him love and encouragement." The source added, "She's been a rock for him, helping him stay positive and focused on his recovery."

Woods' accident on February 23 left him with severe leg injuries, requiring emergency surgery. Dr. Anish Mahajan, Chief Medical Officer and Interim CEO of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where Woods was initially treated, described the injuries as "significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity."

Mahajan elaborated, "Comminuted open fractures affecting both the upper and lower portions of the tibia and fibula bones were stabilized by inserting a rod into the tibia. Additional injuries to the bones of the foot and ankle were stabilized with screws and pins."

Woods was later transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for further treatment. Despite the severity of his injuries, Woods has expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support from fans and fellow golfers via Twitter.

"I'm so grateful for the outpouring of support and prayers from the golf community and my fans," Woods tweeted. "I'm doing my best to recover and will keep you all updated on my progress."

Woods has two children, Sam and Charlie, with ex-wife Elin Nordegren, whom he divorced in 2010. Lindsey Vonn, Woods' ex-girlfriend, also expressed her prayers for him following the accident.

Woods and Herman confirmed their relationship in November 2017. Herman, a restaurant manager, expressed optimism about the future of their relationship. "We're very happy together," she said at the time.

Herman's unwavering support has been instrumental in Woods' recovery. Her presence has provided him with a sense of stability and comfort during this challenging time.

As Woods continues his rehabilitation, Herman remains a constant source of strength and encouragement, helping him navigate the road to recovery with resilience and determination.
