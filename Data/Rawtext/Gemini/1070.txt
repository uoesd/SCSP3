Laundrie Sighting Reported in Wyoming

NEW YORK (WABC) – A woman has come forward claiming she gave Brian Laundrie a ride in Wyoming on August 29, four days after Gabby Petito's last known call to her family.

Miranda Baker told "Good Morning America" that she picked up Laundrie hitchhiking near Grand Teton National Park. Laundrie allegedly told Baker he had been camping alone and that Petito was working on their social media.

Baker said Laundrie exited her car after learning they were heading to Jackson Hole. She described him as "odd" and "agitated."

The FBI has since found a body in Grand Teton National Park matching Petito's description. The cause of death has not yet been determined.

The Laundrie family attorney, Steven Bertolino, released a statement expressing heartbreak over the news of Petito's death and offering prayers to her family.

Brian Laundrie remains missing. He was last seen by his family in Florida on September 14. Police searches for Laundrie are currently focused on the Carlton Reserve in Sarasota County, Florida.

In a separate development, police in Moab, Utah, released a body camera video of an interaction between Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie on August 12. The video shows Petito crying and upset, while Laundrie appears calm and collected.
