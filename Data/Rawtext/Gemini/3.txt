Biden Inaugurated as 46th President, Vowing Unity and Healing

Washington CNN – Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday, pledging to be a "president for all Americans" and to heal the divisions that have plagued the nation.

The inauguration ceremony took place with heightened security and COVID-19 precautions, without the presence of outgoing President Donald Trump.

Trump left the White House for the last time as president early Wednesday morning, expressing it was a "great honor" to serve. He spoke at Joint Base Andrews, thanking his family and chief of staff, and wishing the incoming administration "great luck" without naming Biden.

Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris attended morning services at Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle with their families and Congressional leaders.

Harris made history as the first female, first Black, and first South Asian vice president of the United States.

Biden, sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts using a family Bible, pledged to be a "president for all Americans".

"Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: Bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation," Biden said in his inaugural address. "And I ask every American to join me in this cause."

The inauguration featured performances by Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, Garth Brooks, and poet Amanda Gorman.

Biden signed his first presidential documents, including an Inauguration Day Proclamation and nominations.

Biden and Harris participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery with former presidents.

Biden signed over a dozen executive actions targeting Trump's legacy and emphasized respect among White House staff.

Biden's Inaugural Address

In his inaugural address, Biden outlined his vision for the country and called for unity.

"We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal," Biden said. "We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes."

Biden also addressed the challenges facing the nation, including the COVID-19 pandemic, economic inequality, and climate change.

"We have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities," Biden said. "Much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build, and much to gain."

Trump's Farewell Address

In his farewell address at Joint Base Andrews, Trump thanked his supporters and touted his accomplishments in office.

"I want to thank you for this extraordinary privilege," Trump said. "It has been an honor of a lifetime."

Trump also wished the incoming administration well, without naming Biden.

"I wish the new administration great luck and great success," Trump said. "I think they'll have great success. They have the foundation to do something really spectacular."

Harris Makes History

Kamala Harris made history on Wednesday as the first female, first Black, and first South Asian vice president of the United States.

"I am honored and humbled to be standing before you today as Vice President of the United States," Harris said in her inaugural address. "I stand on the shoulders of those who came before me, those who fought and sacrificed so much for equality and justice in our country."

Harris also pledged to work to unite the country and address the challenges facing the nation.

"We are facing a moment of great challenge," Harris said. "But I know that we can overcome these challenges together. We can build a more just, equitable, and inclusive America."

Biden's First Actions

After being sworn in, Biden signed a series of executive actions, including:

  • Reversing Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement
  • Rejoining the World Health Organization
  • Ending the travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries
  • Extending the eviction moratorium
  • Providing economic relief to Americans struggling during the pandemic

Biden also signed a memorandum directing federal agencies to review and rescind Trump-era regulations that are harmful to the environment or public health.
