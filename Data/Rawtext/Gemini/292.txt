FDA Expands Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Booster Eligibility to 16- and 17-Year-Olds

Rockville, MD – December 9, 2021 – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today expanded the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and Comirnaty (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) to include booster doses for individuals 16 and 17 years of age.

The single booster dose is authorized to be administered at least six months after completion of the primary vaccination series with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

"As we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that we continue to take steps to protect ourselves and our loved ones," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. "Today's action expands the eligibility for booster doses to include 16- and 17-year-olds, providing them with an additional layer of protection against COVID-19."

The FDA's decision is based on a thorough review of data from clinical trials and real-world evidence, which showed that the booster dose provides a substantial increase in immune response in this age group. The FDA also assessed the potential benefits and risks of the booster dose and determined that the benefits outweigh the risks for individuals 16 and 17 years of age.

"Our analysis of the immune response data supports the effectiveness of a booster dose in providing continued protection against COVID-19 in youth and adults," said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "We believe that the benefits of the booster dose outweigh the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis in this younger age group."

The FDA did not convene its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for this decision. The agency determined that the data supporting the booster dose for 16- and 17-year-olds were sufficiently robust and that the benefits of the booster dose outweighed the risks.

The FDA continues to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and Comirnaty in all authorized populations. The agency is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to monitor the safety of the vaccine, including the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis.

Pfizer is conducting ongoing studies to further assess the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination. The FDA and CDC will continue to monitor the safety of the vaccine and will provide updates as necessary.

The FDA encourages all eligible individuals to get vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19. Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from the virus.
