Hollywood Re-evaluates Use of Real Firearms on Sets Amid Safety Concerns

The tragic shooting on the set of "Rust," which resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, has reignited a fierce debate about the use of real firearms on film and television sets. In the wake of the incident, several shows, including "The Rookie" and "The Boys," have banned the use of real guns, and a petition calling for a nationwide ban has garnered nearly 70,000 signatures.

Industry Professionals Speak Out

Leslie Grossman, an actor from "American Horror Story," revealed that she has primarily used rubber or air guns in shooting scenes throughout her career. "I've never felt the need to use a real gun," she said. "There are so many other ways to create the illusion of gunfire without putting people at risk."

Eric Kripke, showrunner of "The Boys," echoed Grossman's sentiments, stating, "We made the decision to ban real guns on our set after the 'Rust' incident. It's just not worth the risk. There are plenty of other ways to create the same effect without endangering anyone."

Legislative Action

The "Rust" tragedy has also prompted calls for legislative action. California State Senator Dave Cortese has introduced a bill that would ban the use of real firearms and live ammunition on film and television sets in the state. "We need to take steps to ensure that tragedies like this never happen again," Cortese said.

Similarly, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has expressed support for legislation that would ban real guns on sets. "We have a responsibility to protect the safety of our workers," Grisham said. "This is a common-sense measure that will help prevent future tragedies."

Safety Concerns and Oversight

Filmmaker Bandar Albuliwi, who started the Change.org petition calling for a ban on real guns on sets, highlighted the lack of safety standards and oversight in the industry. "There are often no clear protocols or guidelines for handling firearms on set," he said. "This needs to change."

Parkland shooting survivor Cameron Kasky also expressed concerns about the safety of film sets. "The film industry needs to take responsibility for the safety of its workers," he said. "No story is worth risking lives."

Advances in Visual Effects

Advances in visual effects technology have made the use of real firearms unnecessary for authenticity in production. Visual effects artists can easily create gun effects like muzzle flashes and bullet impacts in post-production.

"There's no reason to use real guns on sets anymore," said Albuliwi. "Visual effects can create the same effect, and it's much safer."

Culture of Silence

Grossman also highlighted a culture that often silences safety concerns on film sets. "People are often afraid to speak up if they see something unsafe," she said. "We need to create an environment where people feel comfortable raising concerns without fear of retaliation."

"No story is worth risking lives," Grossman emphasized. "We need to put safety first on film and television sets."
