Rickie Fowler on Tiger Woods' Recovery: 'He's in Good Spirits'

Rickie Fowler, who missed the Masters for the first time in a decade, spent part of the weekend watching the tournament's broadcast with Tiger Woods at Woods' home on Jupiter Island.

It was Fowler's first time seeing Woods since the car crash in February that left the 15-time major champion with significant leg injuries.

"It was great to see him," Fowler said. "He's in good spirits. He's obviously disappointed that he can't be out there playing, but he's doing everything he can to get back."

Woods, who has won the Masters five times, and Fowler, who has five top-12 finishes in the tournament, talked about how much they missed being at Augusta National.

"We were both disappointed that we couldn't be out there," Fowler said. "But we had a good time watching the tournament and talking about the course."

Fowler said he and Woods analyzed the course conditions during the Masters.

"We talked about how the course was playing and what the guys were doing well," Fowler said. "It was good to get his perspective on the tournament."

Other Tour pros, including Justin Thomas and Rory McIlroy, have also visited Woods and have been encouraged by his condition.

"He's making progress," Thomas said. "He's still on crutches, but he's getting around. He's in good spirits and he's working hard to get back."

Woods has been seen on crutches and riding in a golf cart, showing progress in his recovery.

"He's doing everything he can to get back," McIlroy said. "He's a fighter and he's not going to give up."

Fowler emphasized that Woods' current focus is on recovering and being able to be active with his children.

"He's just trying to get back to being able to do the things he loves to do," Fowler said. "He wants to be able to play with his kids and be active with them."

Fowler highlighted the severity of Woods' accident but noted the encouragement from Woods' condition.

"It was a serious accident," Fowler said. "But he's lucky to be alive. He's making progress and he's in good spirits. That's all that matters."

Fowler failed to qualify for the Masters for the first time in a decade due to his current World No. 116 ranking.

"It was tough to miss the Masters," Fowler said. "But I'm working hard to get back to where I need to be. I know I can still play at a high level and I'm confident that I can get back to the Masters next year."

Fowler's visit with Woods was a reminder of the importance of perseverance and resilience.

"Tiger is a role model for all of us," Fowler said. "He's shown us that anything is possible if you set your mind to it. He's an inspiration to all of us."
