Mary Trump: Donald Trump Would Not Sacrifice Himself for His Children

In a recent interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, Mary Trump, the niece of former President Donald Trump, expressed her belief that her uncle would not hesitate to sacrifice his children if prosecutors targeted them.

"I don't think he would ever sacrifice himself for any of his children," Mary Trump stated. "I think he would expect them to take a hit for him, to his benefit."

Cuomo pressed Mary Trump on whether she believed Donald Trump understood that prosecutors often seek to have individuals flip to target bigger entities. She responded, "I doubt it. I think he sees everything in terms of transactions. He doesn't understand the concept of loyalty or family in the same way that most people do."

Mary Trump further speculated that Donald Trump's children might actually flip if pressured by prosecutors. "I think they're all capable of it," she said. "They've all seen how their father operates, and they know that he's not going to protect them if it comes down to it."

The Trump Organization, where Donald Trump's sons Eric and Donald Jr. are employed, is currently under criminal investigation in New York. Prosecutors in Georgia and Washington, DC, are also investigating Donald Trump's own actions. These investigations underscore the potential legal pressures facing the Trump family.

Mary Trump's insights provide a critical view of Donald Trump's character and priorities. She believes that his self-interest will always outweigh his familial obligations.

"He's a narcissist," Mary Trump said. "He's only interested in himself. He doesn't care about anyone else, not even his own children."

Mary Trump's comments highlight the potential legal risks facing the Trump family. If prosecutors are able to pressure Donald Trump's children to cooperate, it could lead to significant legal consequences for the former president himself.
