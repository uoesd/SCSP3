CNN Anchors Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon Launch Podcast 'The Handoff'

CNN primetime anchors Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon are teaming up for a new podcast titled "The Handoff," which will feature unscripted and honest conversations between the two. The weekly podcast will be available with a subscription to the CNN channel on Apple Podcasts.

"The Handoff" is based on the spontaneous "handoff" conversations that Cuomo and Lemon have between their respective shows, "Cuomo Prime Time" and "Don Lemon Tonight." These conversations have often made news, including a recent discussion about Rick Santorum's offensive remarks.

"We're going to have real conversations, unscripted, unfiltered, and honest," Lemon said in a statement. "This podcast is not for the easily offended."

Cuomo added, "We're going to talk about the things that people are really thinking and feeling, but that often get glossed over in the media."

The podcast is part of a new wave of podcasts launched by CNN, which is aiming to expand its digital revenue streams. Other new CNN podcasts include "Behind the Desk: The Story of Late Night" and a podcast by Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

Cuomo and Lemon said they hope "The Handoff" will offer content that toughens up the audience through straightforward dialogue.

"We're not going to sugarcoat things," Cuomo said. "We're going to tell it like it is."

Lemon added, "We're going to challenge each other, and we're going to challenge our listeners. But we're also going to have fun."

The anchors said they were curious about what their discussions would sound like in a podcast format.

"We've always had great conversations off the air," Cuomo said. "I think our listeners will enjoy hearing them in a more intimate setting."

Lemon agreed, saying, "We're not going to be held back by the constraints of television. We're going to be able to say whatever we want, and we're going to have a lot of fun doing it."

"The Handoff" is expected to launch in the coming weeks.
