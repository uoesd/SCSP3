Kenosha Protests Erupt Over Rittenhouse Acquittal, Demand Justice for Chrystul Kizer

Kenosha, WI - Demonstrators took to the streets of Kenosha on Saturday, November 20, to protest the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse and demand justice for Chrystul Kizer, a sex trafficking victim accused of killing her abuser.

The rally, which began in Civic Center Park, saw protesters march through downtown Kenosha, chanting Kizer's name alongside those of Anthony Huber, Joseph Rosenbaum, and Gaige Grosskreutz, the three men Rittenhouse shot during the August 2020 unrest in the city.

"We are here today to say that the system is broken," said Jess Singh, a Kenosha resident and member of the Party of Socialism and Liberation. "Kyle Rittenhouse was a vigilante who killed two people and injured a third, yet he walked free. Meanwhile, Chrystul Kizer, a victim of sex trafficking, is facing life in prison for defending herself against her abuser."

State Rep. David Bowen (D-Milwaukee) echoed Singh's sentiments, calling on protesters to fight for justice for Kizer with the same vigor they had for Rittenhouse and Jacob Blake, a Black man shot by police in Kenosha in August 2020.

"We cannot allow our justice system to continue to treat victims like criminals and criminals like heroes," Bowen said. "We must demand accountability for Kyle Rittenhouse and justice for Chrystul Kizer."

Lorna Revere, a Racine resident, emphasized her continuous commitment to social justice and highlighted Kizer's significance.

"Chrystul Kizer is a symbol of the countless victims of sex trafficking who are silenced and forgotten," Revere said. "We will not rest until she receives the justice she deserves."

The rally expressed collective anger and determination to keep fighting for systemic change. Bishop Tavis Grant of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition and Justin Blake, the uncle of Jacob Blake, demanded economic consequences for militia supporters and criticized President Biden's acceptance of the Rittenhouse verdict.

"We must hit these militia groups where it hurts, in their pocketbooks," Grant said. "We must also hold President Biden accountable for his failure to condemn the violence in Kenosha and his acceptance of the Rittenhouse verdict."

Rittenhouse's lawyers argued that he was not a militia member but was protecting property during the August 2020 unrest. However, controversy has surrounded his affiliations with far-right symbols and groups.

Rev. Jesse Jackson has called for a Department of Justice review of the Rittenhouse case, demonstrating broader calls for accountability.

Leaders at the protest expressed dissatisfaction with political responses, particularly from President Biden and Gov. Tony Evers.

"President Biden and Gov. Evers have failed to provide the leadership we need on this issue," said Singh. "They have allowed the system to continue to fail victims like Chrystul Kizer and Jacob Blake."

The protest ended with a call for continued action and a commitment to fighting for justice for all victims of violence and oppression.
