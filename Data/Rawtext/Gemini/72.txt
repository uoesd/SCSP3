House Panel Subpoenas Proud Boys, Oath Keepers in Jan. 6 Probe

The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot has issued subpoenas to the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, and their leaders, Henry "Enrique" Tarrio and Elmer Stewart Rhodes. The subpoenas are part of the committee's ongoing effort to understand how the deadly invasion of the Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump unfolded.

"We are determined to get to the bottom of what happened on January 6th," said Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Chairman of the Select Committee. "These subpoenas are an important step in that process." The subpoenas seek documents and testimony related to the events leading up to and during the Capitol attack. The committee is particularly interested in understanding the coordination between the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, and other groups involved in the violence. Prosecutors have noted coordination between Capitol riot defendants, the Proud Boys, and the Oath Keepers. A subpoena references a "conspiracy among at least 18 Oath Keepers" to storm the Capitol with paramilitary gear and weapons. Rhodes was indirectly mentioned in an indictment for being in direct contact with indicted Oath Keepers before, during, and after the Capitol attack. Prior to Jan. 6, Rhodes allegedly made remarks suggesting the Oath Keepers were prepared to use violence to ensure their preferred election outcome. The subpoenas also target 1st Amendment Praetorian, another organization involved with the events leading up to the Jan. 6 attack.
