Trump's Incitement Blamed for Capitol Riot Death of Georgia Woman

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The brother-in-law of Rosanne Boyland, a Trump supporter from Georgia who died during the U.S. Capitol assault, has blamed the former president for her death and called for his removal from office.

Boyland's cause of death has not been officially disclosed, but a friend reported that she was trampled in the crowd during the January 6 riot.

"This is all on Trump," Justin Cave, Boyland's brother-in-law, told Reuters. "He incited this violence. He told his supporters to come to Washington and 'fight' at the Capitol. This is the direct result of his actions."

A White House spokesman did not comment on Boyland's death.

Trump has repeatedly denied responsibility for the Capitol riot, claiming that his supporters were "patriots" who were simply exercising their First Amendment rights. However, Democratic leaders are calling for Trump's removal through the 25th Amendment or impeachment.

Boyland was one of four civilians who died during the riot. Ashli Babbitt was shot by Capitol Police, and two men died from medical emergencies. Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick also died from injuries sustained during the riot.

Justin Winchell, a friend of Boyland's, said that she was a "kind and loving person" who was "just trying to support the president."

"She didn't deserve to die like this," Winchell said. "Trump's words incited this violence, and he is responsible for her death."

Cave said that he supports invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.

"He is a danger to our democracy," Cave said. "He needs to be removed from office immediately."

The 25th Amendment allows for the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare the president unable to fulfill the duties of the office. If this happens, the vice president would become acting president.

Democratic leaders have also called for Trump's impeachment. A resolution to impeach Trump was introduced in the House of Representatives on January 11, and a vote is expected this week.

If the House votes to impeach Trump, he would then face a trial in the Senate. If two-thirds of the Senate votes to convict Trump, he would be removed from office.

It is unclear whether the Senate would vote to convict Trump. Some Republican senators have said that they believe Trump should be removed from office, but it is unclear whether there are enough votes to convict him.

The Capitol riot was one of the darkest days in American history. It is a reminder of the dangers of political extremism and the importance of protecting our democracy.
