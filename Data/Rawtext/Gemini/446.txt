Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Wax Figures Relocated to Hollywood Zone at Madame Tussauds

LONDON, May 13 – Madame Tussauds London has moved the waxwork models of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle from the royal section to the Hollywood zone, reflecting their physical move from Frogmore Cottage in the UK to Los Angeles, USA.

The relocation, to the Awards Party zone, mirrors the couple's transition from royal duties to a more celebrity lifestyle. It comes a year after they stepped back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family.

A television documentary series on mental health, co-created by Prince Harry and Oprah Winfrey, is set to premiere on Apple TV+. Ahead of its premiere, Prince Harry compared his royal life to the 'Truman Show' during an appearance on the 'Armchair Expert' podcast.

He also shared details about his and Meghan's attempts to evade paparazzi by meeting in a supermarket when they first started dating. Prince Harry highlighted the sense of freedom and relief they have experienced since moving to California.

Their move to the USA allows Prince Harry to enjoy simple pleasures, such as taking their son Archie on bike rides, which he felt was not possible before. The relocation of their wax figures symbolizes a significant shift in how they are perceived, from royal figures to global celebrities.

Madame Tussauds London's general manager, Steve Davies, said: "We have moved the figures of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to our Awards Party zone to reflect their new status as global celebrities."

The move follows a similar decision by Madame Tussauds New York, which relocated the couple's wax figures to its Hollywood zone in March.

The relocation of the wax figures is a symbolic representation of the couple's departure from the royal family and their embrace of a new life in the United States. It also highlights the changing nature of celebrity and the increasing blurring of lines between the royal and entertainment worlds.
