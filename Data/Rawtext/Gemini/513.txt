Hurricane Ida's Impact on Shell's Gulf Production to Linger into 2022

HOUSTON, Sept 20 – Royal Dutch Shell, the largest U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil producer, is still grappling with the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, which caused significant damage to its infrastructure and disrupted production.

The storm, which made landfall in Louisiana on August 29, forced Shell to shut down all of its Gulf of Mexico production, removing 28 million barrels from the market and sending crude prices higher as buyers scrambled for alternatives to the popular Gulf Mars grade.

Three weeks after the storm, around 40% of Shell's production from the offshore region remains offline, according to the company. The damaged Shell transfer facility, West Delta-143 (WD-143), is a critical piece of infrastructure that handles the transfer of Mars sour crude, a grade highly sought after by refiners in the U.S. and Asia.

Rystad Energy analyst Paola Rodriguez-Masiu estimated that the lost production would reduce the Gulf of Mexico oil supply by 200,000 to 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) for several months.

"The prolonged shut-in of the WD-143 platform is also affecting smaller operators, such as LLOG Exploration Co LLC," Rodriguez-Masiu said. "LLOG's Delta House platform, which is tied into the WD-143 platform, has also been shut in since the hurricane."

Mars crude prices reached a one-year high of $76.70 per barrel this month but have since dropped to a $2 per barrel discount to the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI).

Shell's Mars and Ursa oilfields, which contribute about 200,000 bpd combined, are expected to be affected into the first quarter of next year, according to the company.

The prolonged shutdown of Shell's Gulf of Mexico production is a major blow to the U.S. oil industry, which has been struggling to keep up with demand as the global economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), 18% of U.S. Gulf's oil and 27% of its natural gas production remained offline more than three weeks after Hurricane Ida.

Mars crude exports accounted for about 5.5% of total U.S. crude exports in the first eight months of 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

The loss of Mars crude production is likely to put upward pressure on prices for other grades of crude, such as WTI and Brent.

"The market is still very tight, and the loss of Mars crude is only going to make it tighter," said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group. "We could see WTI prices move back up to $80 per barrel or higher in the coming weeks."
