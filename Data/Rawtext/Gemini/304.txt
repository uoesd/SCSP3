FDA Authorizes Over-the-Counter COVID-19 Tests for Serial Screening

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized several tests for over-the-counter (OTC) use without a prescription for serial screening of asymptomatic individuals. These tests are intended to assist schools, workplaces, and communities in setting up COVID-19 screening programs.

"Screening testing is a critical tool in our fight against COVID-19," said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. "These tests meet the FDA's scientific standards for emergency use authorization and will help us to identify and isolate infected individuals, even if they are not showing symptoms."

The FDA has authorized one serial screening test for point-of-care (POC) setting without a prescription and another for POC use with a prescription. The authorized tests include:

  • Quidel QuickVue: Authorized for OTC use without a prescription for serial screening of asymptomatic individuals in POC settings.
  • Abbott BinaxNOW: Authorized for OTC use without a prescription for serial screening of asymptomatic individuals in POC settings, and for prescription use in POC settings for symptomatic individuals.
  • BD Veritor System: Authorized for prescription use in POC settings for serial screening of asymptomatic individuals.

These tests were previously authorized for symptomatic testing but have now been extended for asymptomatic use in serial testing. Serial screening involves testing individuals multiple times over a period of time, which can help to identify infected individuals who may not be showing symptoms.

The FDA's authorization of these tests is part of its ongoing efforts to increase consumer access to testing and support the establishment of screening programs. The agency has taken various measures throughout the pandemic to facilitate the development and authorization of COVID-19 tests, including issuing guidance documents, providing technical assistance to manufacturers, and expediting the review process for test applications.

"The FDA is committed to ensuring that the public has access to accurate and reliable tests for COVID-19," said Shuren. "These authorizations are part of our broader mandate to protect public health by regulating drugs, medical devices, the food supply, and other areas."

The FDA encourages individuals to talk to their healthcare provider to determine if serial screening is right for them. The agency also reminds individuals to follow all applicable public health recommendations, including wearing a mask, social distancing, and getting vaccinated.
