Baghdad Election Protests Erupt in Violence, Two Dead

Baghdad, Iraq – Protests in Baghdad against the results of the parliamentary elections turned violent on Wednesday, with clashes erupting outside the heavily fortified Green Zone.

Supporters of pro-Iranian groups, which suffered significant losses in the elections, confronted security forces, throwing stones and setting tires ablaze.

"The protesters are angry about the election results," said Mahmoud Abdelwahed, a reporter for Al Jazeera. "They believe the elections were rigged and that their votes were stolen."

There are reports of two dead protesters and dozens wounded, though these have not been officially confirmed.

The October 10 parliamentary vote results showed Moqtada al-Sadr's bloc winning 73 seats, the largest group in parliament. The Conquest Alliance, the political arm of the pro-Iranian Hashd al-Shaabi, won about 15 seats, a significant decrease from the previous 48.

Over 1,300 appeals were lodged with Iraq's independent election commission by Shia groups dissatisfied with the results. The majority of the complaints were dismissed by the commission for lack of evidence.

Final election results are pending but unlikely to differ significantly from the preliminary outcomes.

The election was held months ahead of schedule following nationwide protests demanding political reform. The low turnout of 41 percent reflects widespread disillusionment with Iraq's political elite.

"The people of Iraq are tired of corruption and mismanagement," said Abdelwahed. "They want to see change, but they don't believe that the current political system can deliver it."

The violence outside the Green Zone is a reminder of the deep divisions that remain in Iraqi society. The pro-Iranian groups have accused the government of suppressing their supporters and rigging the elections. The government has denied these allegations.

The protests are likely to continue in the coming days, as the political parties negotiate to form a new government. It remains to be seen whether the new government will be able to address the grievances of the Iraqi people and bring about the change they have been demanding.
