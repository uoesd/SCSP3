COVID-19 and HIV: A Dual Threat to Global Health

The COVID-19 pandemic has cast a spotlight on the urgent need to address the interactions between the virus and HIV, a pre-existing condition that affects millions worldwide.

"We need to pay attention to the interactions between COVID-19 and HIV," said Tulio de Oliveira, Director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation at Stellenbosch University. "Failure to do so risks greater danger and the emergence of new coronavirus variants."

HIV and COVID-19: A Double Burden

People with HIV are at an increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. Studies have shown that they are 30-50% more likely to die from the virus, with the risk being even higher in those with advanced HIV.

"Prolonged infections in immunocompromised individuals, like those with advanced HIV, can lead to concerning coronavirus variants," de Oliveira explained. "These variants may be more transmissible or resistant to vaccines, posing a threat to global health."

Sub-Saharan Africa: A Region of Concern

Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to the dual threat of COVID-19 and HIV. The region has a high prevalence of HIV and insufficient coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART), which suppresses the virus and reduces the risk of transmission.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare systems in Africa, reducing HIV testing and affecting prevention programs," de Oliveira said. "This has led to an increase in HIV infections and a decline in ART coverage."

Vaccine Disparities and COVAX Shortfall

Africa lags significantly behind other regions in COVID-19 vaccine access. Less than 7% of the population is fully vaccinated, compared to the global average of 40%.

"The COVAX initiative, which aims to distribute two billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021, is falling short of its goal," de Oliveira said. "This is leaving millions of vulnerable people unprotected."

A Call for Action

Addressing the dual threat of COVID-19 and HIV requires a comprehensive and coordinated response.

"We need to simultaneously tackle both pandemics," de Oliveira said. "This means increasing access to COVID-19 vaccines, expanding ART coverage, and strengthening healthcare systems."

By addressing the interactions between COVID-19 and HIV, we can not only protect the most vulnerable but also contribute to global health security.
