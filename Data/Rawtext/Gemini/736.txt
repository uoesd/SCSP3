Waco High School Parents Alarmed by Social Media Shooting Threats

Parents in Central Texas are expressing concern over threats of a possible shooting at Waco High School that have been circulating on social media. The threats emerged following a tragic school shooting in Michigan last week, which has sparked similar false threats against schools across the nation.

"My child has been getting these threats nonstop on Snapchat and Twitter," said Jessica Bowman, a parent of a Waco High School student. "It's terrifying to think that someone could be targeting our school."

Alveena Delacruz, another parent, echoed Bowman's concerns. "The school needs to do a better job of communicating with us about these threats and what they're doing to keep our kids safe," she said.

Parents have suggested that the school enhance its security measures, such as increasing the presence of law enforcement officers or installing metal detectors. "We need to take every possible precaution to prevent a tragedy from happening here," said Bowman.

Waco ISD has acknowledged the concerns and has been in communication with parents and students. "We are aware of the threats and are taking them seriously," said Alice Jauregui, Director of Communications for Waco ISD. "We have investigated the threats and found them not to be credible."

Jauregui added that the school has security measures in place and is working closely with local law enforcement. "We urge parents and students to report any such threats they see on social media to the school or law enforcement, instead of sharing them," she said.

Waco police have identified the threats as part of a trending hoax and have confirmed that the source of the threats is not credible. "We have investigated the threats and have found no evidence to suggest that they are credible," said a Waco police spokesperson.

Despite the assurances from the school and law enforcement, parents are seeking concrete actions and information on safety measures. "We need to know what the school is doing to keep our kids safe," said Delacruz. "We can't just rely on the police to prevent a tragedy."

Waco ISD has encouraged parents to talk to their children about the importance of reporting any suspicious activity or threats they see or hear. "We need to work together to keep our schools safe," said Jauregui.

The threats have created an atmosphere of anxiety and fear among parents and students. "I'm afraid to send my child to school," said Bowman. "I don't know if they're safe."

Waco ISD and law enforcement are urging parents and students to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity. "We are committed to ensuring the safety of our students and staff," said Jauregui. "We will continue to monitor the situation and take all necessary precautions."
