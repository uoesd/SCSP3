Chicago Man Arrested for Threatening to Kill Democrats During Biden's Inauguration

Chicago Heights, Ill. - Louis Capriotti, 45, was arrested on Monday for threatening to kill Democrats during President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.

According to the criminal complaint, Capriotti left a voicemail message on December 29 threatening to kill Democrats and their families. The message was sent to the office of U.S. Rep. Andy Kim (D-N.J.).

Capriotti has allegedly left multiple disturbing messages to members of Congress previously. In one message, he threatened to "put a bullet in" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

Capriotti faces a charge of transmitting a threat in interstate commerce. If convicted, he could face a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

"Threats against public servants are serious crimes," said U.S. Attorney John R. Lausch Jr. "We will not tolerate threats of violence against those who serve our country."

The arrest comes amid heightened concern about potential violence leading up to and during the inauguration. Last week, President Trump approved an emergency declaration to boost security in Washington D.C.

An FBI memo warned of armed protests expected at all 50 state capitols and D.C. around the inauguration.

"We are taking these threats seriously," said Lausch. "We are working closely with our law enforcement partners to ensure the safety of the public and those who will be attending the inauguration."

The storming of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters on January 6 resulted in five deaths. The attack has raised concerns about the potential for further violence in the coming days.

"We are committed to protecting the peaceful transfer of power," said Lausch. "We will not allow violence to disrupt this important event."
