Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie Seen Arguing in Wyoming Restaurant, Witness Claims

SALT LAKE CITY – An Instagram user claims she witnessed Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie arguing at a restaurant in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Aug. 27, 2021, two days after Petito's last known communication with her mother.

The user, @NinaCelie, recounted the incident in a series of Instagram stories, stating that she and her boyfriend, Matt, were dining at the Merry Piglett's Mexican Grill when they noticed the couple.

"My boyfriend has an insane photographic memory," Celie wrote. "He remembered them arguing."

According to Celie, Petito was hysterically crying while Laundrie was seen arguing with the restaurant's hostess and speaking to the manager multiple times.

"His demeanor was violent and relentless," Celie described Laundrie's behavior toward the hostess.

Celie and her boyfriend did not think much of the incident until Matt suddenly remembered it on a Wednesday morning.

"He was like, 'Oh my gosh, I think I remember seeing Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie in Jackson Hole,'" Celie recalled.

The FBI is seeking information from anyone who was in the area from Aug. 27 to Aug. 30, 2021, and is asking them to upload any potential evidence to the FBI's online portal.

Petito's last known communication with her mother was on Aug. 25, according to a timeline compiled by ABC News. Laundrie returned home in Petito's van on Sept. 1 without her.

Petito was reported missing by her family on Sept. 11, and Laundrie was reported missing by his family on Sept. 17. Petito's body was found on Sept. 19 in the Bridger-Teton National Park and was identified on Sept. 21.

The Teton County Coroner's Office ruled Petito's death a homicide by strangulation. Laundrie was named a person of interest in Petito's disappearance and was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park in Florida.

The FBI is continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding Petito's death and Laundrie's involvement. Anyone with information is urged to contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324).
