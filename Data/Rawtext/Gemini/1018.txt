Obama Demands Permanent Trump Social Media Ban to Prevent Violence

Former First Lady Michelle Obama has joined the chorus of voices calling for a permanent ban on former President Donald Trump from social media platforms, arguing that his continued presence poses a threat to public safety.

"We cannot afford to have someone who has repeatedly incited violence and hatred continue to have a platform to spread his dangerous rhetoric," Obama said in a statement. "The events of January 6th made it clear that his words have real-world consequences, and we cannot allow him to continue to use social media to sow division and violence."

Trump is currently blocked from posting to Facebook and Instagram "indefinitely," according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. However, Obama criticized Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for not taking action sooner to stop the spread of extremist content from Trump and his supporters.

"These companies have a responsibility to protect their users from harm, and they have failed to do so," Obama said. "They have allowed their platforms to be used to spread misinformation, hate speech, and violence, and they must be held accountable."

The call for a permanent ban on Trump follows the recent rioting at the Capitol, which has been widely condemned. Trump has been accused of inciting the violence with his repeated claims that the election was stolen from him.

Silicon Valley has been resistant to banning Trump, even amidst claims of voter fraud. However, the Capitol violence appears to have shifted the debate, with many now arguing that Trump's continued presence on social media poses a clear and present danger.

Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, blamed Trump and tech companies for the Capitol violence, calling for a permanent ban.

"Trump's rhetoric has been a catalyst for violence and hatred, and the tech companies have enabled him," Greenblatt said. "They must now take responsibility for their actions and ban him permanently."

Greenblatt emphasized that freedom of expression does not include inciting violence.

"The First Amendment does not protect speech that is likely to incite imminent lawless action," Greenblatt said. "Trump's words have repeatedly met this standard, and he must be held accountable."

Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, also called for permanent bans on Trump's social media accounts.

"Trump's continued presence on social media is a threat to our national security," Thompson said. "He has repeatedly used these platforms to spread misinformation and incite violence, and he must be held accountable."

Thompson criticized Facebook and Twitter for only acting after significant violence occurred.

"These companies have been complicit in Trump's dangerous rhetoric for too long," Thompson said. "They must now take action to protect the public from further harm."

Sarah Kate Ellis, President and CEO of GLAAD, urged Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to ban Trump to protect people from further danger.

"Trump's tweets have been used to incite violence and spread hate," Ellis said. "Twitter has a responsibility to protect its users, and that means banning Trump permanently."

The calls for a permanent ban on Trump are likely to intensify in the coming days and weeks. It remains to be seen whether Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube will heed these calls, but the pressure on them to do so is growing.
