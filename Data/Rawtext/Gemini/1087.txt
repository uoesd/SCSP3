Gabby Petito Remembered as 'Super Kind-Hearted' by Long Island Surf Shop Owner

Long Island, NY - The owner of a surf shop in Gabby Petito's hometown described her as a "super kind-hearted, sweet girl" who was always smiling.

"She was a longtime customer, and she was always so happy," said the owner, who wished to remain anonymous. "She would come in and talk to us about her travels and her plans for the future."

Petito's remains were found in Wyoming's Teton-Bridger National Forest on September 19, with her death ruled as a homicide by the Teton County Coroner. She had been missing since late August while on a cross-country trip with her fiancé, Brian Laundrie.

Petito and Laundrie started their road trip in June, traveling from Florida to New York and then towards western national parks. Petito visited the surf shop before leaving Long Island in early July, buying a shirt for Laundrie.

"She was so excited about their trip," the owner recalled. "She told us they were going to see all the national parks and just enjoy life."

Laundrie returned to Florida on September 1 without Petito and has been named a person of interest in her disappearance. Petito's white van was seized from Laundrie's family home on September 11.

Friends and family of Petito describe her as creative, artistic, and someone who wanted to live life to the fullest.

"She was always up for an adventure," said Nichole Schmidt, Petito's mother. "She loved to travel and explore new places."

Authorities are searching for Laundrie in a Florida nature reserve and other locations.

"We are determined to find Brian Laundrie and bring him to justice," said FBI Special Agent in Charge Michael Schneider. "We believe he has information that can help us solve Gabby's murder."

The surf shop owner expressed sadness and anger over Petito's death.

"She was such a wonderful person," the owner said. "It's heartbreaking to know that she's gone."

Petito's family and friends have set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the costs of her funeral and other expenses. The page has raised over $100,000 in just a few days.

"We are so grateful for the outpouring of support from the community," Schmidt said. "It shows how much Gabby was loved."

The investigation into Petito's death is ongoing. Authorities are urging anyone with information about Laundrie's whereabouts to contact the FBI.
