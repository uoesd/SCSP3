Tragedy at Oxford High: Four Students Killed, Seven Wounded in Premeditated Shooting

Oxford, Michigan - A horrific shooting incident at Oxford High School on November 30, 2021, has left four students dead and seven others, including a teacher, wounded. The alleged shooter, 15-year-old student Ethan Crumbley, has been charged as an adult with first-degree murder and terrorism.

Premeditated Attack

According to Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald, Crumbley fired at least 30 shots in a premeditated attack that began in a bathroom at the school. "This was not a snap decision," McDonald stated. "This was planned out. He brought the gun into the school with the intent to use it."

Suspect Faces Adult Charges

Crumbley's lawyer, Scott Kozak, entered a not-guilty plea on his behalf. However, Crumbley is being charged as an adult due to the severity of the crime. "The charges against Ethan Crumbley are very serious," said Marc Keast, the prosecutor handling the case. "We believe that he should be held accountable for his actions as an adult."

Parents Charged with Involuntary Manslaughter

In a shocking twist, Crumbley's parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, were charged with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly failing to secure the gun used in the shooting. They were arrested after missing their arraignment.

Gun Purchased Shortly Before Shooting

James Crumbley purchased the 9mm Sig Sauer SP2022 pistol used in the shooting on November 26, just four days before the incident. Ethan Crumbley posted about the gun on social media, writing, "Just got my new beauty today. Sig Sauer 9mm. Can't wait to try it out."

Warnings Ignored

School officials were warned about Ethan Crumbley's concerning behavior prior to the shooting. A teacher found him searching for ammunition online, and a disturbing drawing of a gun and a person bleeding was discovered on his desk. Despite these warnings, Crumbley was allowed to return to class the day of the shooting with the gun in his backpack.

Methodical Shooting

During the shooting, Crumbley allegedly walked the hallways of the school, shooting students in a methodical manner. "He was shooting at people in the hallways," said Zander Cumbey, a student at Oxford High School. "He was just walking around, shooting people."

Students and Teachers Barricaded

Students and teachers barricaded themselves in classrooms and offices, using objects as potential weapons for self-defense. "We were using chairs and desks to barricade the door," said Aiden Page, a senior at Oxford High School. "We were all scared and didn't know what to do."

Parents Contacted Authorities

Ethan Crumbley's parents contacted authorities and their son via text upon realizing the situation. However, he was already in police custody by then. "We received a text from Ethan's parents saying that they were aware of the situation and that Ethan was in custody," said Tim Willis, a lieutenant with the Oakland County Sheriff's Office.

Investigation Ongoing

The investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and authorities are working to determine the motive behind the attack. "We are still trying to piece together what happened," said Sheriff Michael Bouchard. "We are interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence."

Community in Mourning

The Oxford community is in mourning following the tragic shooting. "This is a devastating loss for our community," said Tim Throne, superintendent of the Oxford High School District. "Our hearts go out to the families of the victims."

Calls for Gun Control

The shooting has reignited calls for stricter gun control measures. "We need to do something to stop these senseless shootings," said Karen McDonald. "We can't keep letting our children be killed."

Support for Victims

The community is rallying around the victims and their families. A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise funds for medical expenses and other support. "We are all here for each other," said Aiden Page. "We will get through this together."
