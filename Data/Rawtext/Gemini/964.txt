A 9/11-Style Commission for the Capitol Riot: A Path to Unity

In the aftermath of the unprecedented attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has proposed the establishment of a 9/11-style commission to investigate the riot and its underlying causes. This commission, if formed, would be tasked with conducting a comprehensive and impartial inquiry into the events of that fateful day, with the aim of preventing similar incidents in the future.

The proposed commission would be modeled after the 9/11 Commission, which was established in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The 9/11 Commission was a bipartisan body that conducted a thorough and independent investigation into the attacks, resulting in a comprehensive report that made recommendations for preventing future terrorist attacks.

The January 6th commission would have a similar mandate, but its focus would be on the Capitol riot. The commission would examine the causes of the riot, including the role of former President Donald Trump and the failure of Capitol security. It would also explore potential external influences, such as claims of infiltration by extremist groups.

One of the most important aspects of the proposed commission is its bipartisan nature. The 9/11 Commission was successful in part because it was able to bring together members of both political parties to work towards a common goal. A bipartisan January 6th commission would send a powerful message that both parties are committed to finding the truth and preventing future violence.

However, for the commission to be truly credible, it is essential that it be genuinely bipartisan. This means that both parties must have an equal say in the commission's work and that the commission's findings must be based on evidence, not partisan politics.

It is also important that the commission investigate Speaker Pelosi's decisions related to the events of January 6th. Pelosi has been criticized by some for her handling of the Capitol security situation, and it is important for the commission to examine her actions to ensure that all aspects of the riot are fully understood.

The commission's work will undoubtedly be challenging. It will require members to confront uncomfortable truths and to put the pursuit of truth above partisan gains. However, if the commission is successful, it could help to bridge America's political divisions and prevent future violence.

The Capitol riot was a dark day for American democracy. But it also presents an opportunity for us to come together as a nation and to learn from our mistakes. A well-executed 9/11-style commission could help us to do just that.
