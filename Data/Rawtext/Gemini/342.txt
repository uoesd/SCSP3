False Claims: U.S. Navy SEALs Did Not Rescue Trafficked Children from Ever Given Ship

In the wake of the Ever Given cargo ship's blockage of the Suez Canal in March 2021, a false and outlandish story has emerged, claiming that U.S. Navy SEALs rescued over a thousand trafficked children from the vessel. This fabricated narrative, originating from a website known for spreading misinformation, has gained traction on social media, prompting a thorough fact check to debunk its baseless claims.

Origin of the False Story

The false story of the child rescue operation originated from Before It's News, a website notorious for publishing unsubstantiated and misleading content. The website has a history of promoting conspiracy theories and fabricating sensational stories, often with no basis in reality.

Lack of Credible Reporting

Despite the widespread circulation of the story on social media, no credible news publisher or government entity has confirmed the alleged rescue operation. The U.S. Navy, the Egyptian authorities responsible for the Suez Canal, and other relevant organizations have all denied the existence of such an operation.

The Ever Given Incident

The Ever Given cargo ship became stuck in the Suez Canal on March 23, 2021, causing a significant maritime traffic jam. The ship was eventually dislodged on March 29, 2021, after a complex salvage operation.

False Claims of Weapons of Mass Destruction

The false story also claimed that Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) were found on the Ever Given ship. This claim is equally baseless, as no credible source has reported the discovery of any WMDs on the vessel.

Implication of Walmart and Clinton Foundation

The false story further alleged that the Ever Given ship was co-owned by Walmart and the Clinton Foundation, implicating these organizations in an international child trafficking ring. These claims are entirely fabricated and have been repeatedly debunked by both Walmart and the Clinton Foundation.

Catalog Ordering of Trafficked Children

The story also suggested that trafficked children were ordered through catalogs like Wayfair by pedophiles. This claim is part of a larger conspiracy theory that has been circulating online for several years, despite being repeatedly debunked.

Non-Existent 'Telegram'

The false story mentioned a non-existent 'telegram' claiming that the U.S. Navy SEALs had found live and dead children in cargo containers on the Ever Given ship. No such telegram exists, and the claim is entirely fabricated.

Similar False Claims about Wayfair

In July 2020, similar baseless trafficking claims were made about the Wayfair online shopping website. These claims were thoroughly investigated and debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations, including Snopes.com.

Conclusion

The false story claiming that U.S. Navy SEALs rescued over a thousand trafficked children from the Ever Given ship is a fabrication with no basis in reality. The story originated from a website known for spreading misinformation, and no credible news publisher or government entity has confirmed the alleged rescue operation. The false narrative has been debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations, and it is important to rely on credible sources for accurate information.
