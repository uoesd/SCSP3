Trump Faces Historic Second Impeachment for Inciting Violence

CNN – President Donald Trump faces an unprecedented second impeachment, this time for inciting violence against the U.S. government. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on impeachment this week, with the Senate trial taking place after Trump leaves office on January 20th.

This impeachment marks the first time a president has been accused of inciting violence against another branch of government. The Constitution mandates impeachment for "Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."

Democrats allege that Trump incited violence by repeatedly denying the results of the 2020 election and pressuring Georgia's secretary of state to "find" votes. On January 6th, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the election results. Five people died in the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.

The House can impeach a president with a simple majority vote. Fast action is expected on this impeachment, without extended investigations. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered alternatives to impeachment, such as censure, but these were not taken up, moving the House toward rapid impeachment proceedings.

The Senate trial will likely begin after Trump leaves office. The Senate could conduct the trial on a half-day basis to allow time for other legislative activities.

If convicted, Trump could be barred from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the U.S. government. A second impeachment conviction could also affect Trump's ability to run for office in 2024 and might impact his pension.

Impeachment Process

The impeachment process begins in the House of Representatives. A simple majority vote is required to impeach a president. The House Judiciary Committee will draft articles of impeachment, which will then be debated and voted on by the full House.

If the House votes to impeach the president, the Senate will hold a trial. The Senate will vote on whether to convict the president. A two-thirds majority vote is required to convict.

If the Senate convicts the president, he or she will be removed from office. The vice president will then become president.

Previous Impeachments

President Trump is only the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. President Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 for violating the Tenure of Office Act. President Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998 for perjury and obstruction of justice. Both Johnson and Clinton were acquitted by the Senate.

Impact of Impeachment

An impeachment conviction can have a significant impact on a president's legacy. President Clinton's impeachment led to a decline in his approval ratings and contributed to his decision not to run for re-election in 2000.

An impeachment conviction can also affect a president's ability to govern. President Johnson was impeached during a time of great political turmoil, and his impeachment made it difficult for him to pass legislation.

Conclusion

The impeachment of President Trump is a historic event. It is the first time a president has been impeached for inciting violence against another branch of government. The impeachment process is likely to be swift, and the Senate trial could begin after Trump leaves office. If convicted, Trump could be barred from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the U.S. government.
