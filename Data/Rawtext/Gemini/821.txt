California Issues Second Round of Stimulus Checks to Eligible Residents

California is distributing another round of stimulus checks to eligible residents, with the total value of these payments exceeding $857 million. The Golden State Stimulus II checks started being sent out in late August, and the latest batch of payments includes around 750,000 paper checks that began distribution on November 1. Additionally, 400,000 payments were direct deposited on October 29.

To be eligible for the stimulus checks, residents must have filed a 2020 state income tax return by October 15, 2021, earned $75,000 or less, and cannot be claimed as a dependent. Eligible residents must also have a Social Security or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.

The amount of the stimulus checks varies depending on the recipient's income and tax filing status. Single filers with incomes of $75,000 or less will receive $600, while joint filers with incomes of $150,000 or less will receive $1,200. Residents with dependents will receive an additional $500 per dependent, up to a maximum of three dependents.

Direct deposit payments may take several days to appear in recipients' bank accounts, while paper checks distribution depends on the recipient's zip code. The expected completion of stimulus check distribution spans into early next year.

An estimated nine million Californians are poised to receive the stimulus checks. Residents can use an online tool provided by California to check their payment eligibility.

The Golden State Stimulus II program is part of California's efforts to provide financial relief to residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first round of stimulus checks, which were issued in the spring of 2021, provided over $11 billion in assistance to Californians.

The distribution of the second round of stimulus checks is expected to provide much-needed financial relief to millions of Californians who are still struggling financially due to the pandemic. The payments can be used to cover a variety of expenses, such as rent, groceries, and utilities.

The California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) is responsible for issuing the stimulus checks. Residents with questions about the program can contact the FTB at 1-800-542-9332.
