Chauvin Convicted in Floyd's Death, Sparking Global Protests and Calls for Reform

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty Tuesday of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd.

The verdict followed three weeks of testimony and about 10 hours of jury deliberations over two days. It marked a rare conviction for an on-duty police killing and has triggered worldwide protests and a reexamination of racism and policing in the United States.

"Today, we are able to breathe again," said Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's younger brother. "We have to make sure that this verdict is a turning point in history."

Chauvin's conviction has been hailed by President Joe Biden and other leaders as a step towards justice and systemic reform.

"This can be a moment of significant change for our nation," Biden said. "It's a moment to heal, to listen, to understand, and to unite."

The case centered on the May 25, 2020, death of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, who died after Chauvin, a white officer, knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes during an arrest.

Bystander video of Floyd's final moments, which was widely shared on social media, played a crucial role in the prosecution's case.

"Believe your eyes," prosecutor Jerry Blackwell urged the jury during closing arguments. "That's what the evidence in this case shows you."

Chauvin's defense argued that his actions were reasonable and that Floyd's death was due to health issues and drug use. Chauvin did not testify, and his attorney Eric Nelson did not comment following the verdict.

The jury deliberated for about 10 hours over two days before reaching a verdict. The jurors, who remained anonymous, included six white women, four white men, one Black man, and one Asian woman.

Chauvin was taken into custody immediately after the verdict was read. He is scheduled to be sentenced in eight weeks.

The verdict has sparked protests in cities across the United States and around the world. Demonstrators have called for an end to police brutality and systemic racism.

In Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed, protesters gathered outside the courthouse and marched through the streets.

"This is a victory for George Floyd and his family," said Janay Henry, a witness who testified during the trial. "But it's also a victory for all of us who have been fighting for justice."

Jamee Haggard, another witness, said the verdict "gives me hope that we can change the system."

The Justice Department announced Tuesday that it will investigate Minneapolis policing practices following the verdict.

"We are committed to ensuring that the Minneapolis Police Department is operating in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution and federal law," said Sarah Fitzgerald, a Department of Corrections spokeswoman.

The Floyd case has had a profound impact on the United States. It has led to widespread protests, the removal of Confederate statues, and reforms in policing practices.

The verdict is a reminder that police officers can be held accountable for their actions. It is also a call to action for systemic reform to address the deep-seated racism that plagues our society.

"We have a lot of work to do," Biden said. "But today is a day of hope."
