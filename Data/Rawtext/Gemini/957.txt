Melania Trump's Post-White House Life: Retreat, Resentment, and a Glimmer of Regret

CNN – Since departing the White House, Melania Trump has retreated from the public eye, seeking solace in relaxation and distancing herself from the political fray that consumed her husband's presidency.

Her days at Mar-a-Lago, the Trump family's sprawling estate in Palm Beach, Florida, are a far cry from the whirlwind of official events and public appearances that defined her time as first lady. Now, her routine revolves around leisurely spa treatments, lunches with friends, and intimate dinners with her family.

"She's really enjoying her time away from the spotlight," said Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former senior adviser to Melania Trump. "She's focused on her well-being and spending time with her loved ones."

Despite her low-key existence, Melania Trump is not entirely absent from public life. She is in the process of setting up an official office in Florida and plans to continue her Be Best campaign, which focused on children's well-being.

However, beneath the surface of her tranquil post-White House life, there lies a simmering bitterness and regret over the events that transpired following the January 6 insurrection and her departure from Washington.

Melania Trump had the lowest favorability ratings of any modern first lady upon leaving office. Her decision not to make a public statement condemning the Capitol riot, fearing backlash from either side, drew widespread criticism.

"She was disappointed by the way she left Washington," said Wolkoff. "She felt like she had been unfairly treated and that her legacy had been tarnished."

Melania Trump has also expressed resentment towards her husband, Donald Trump, for his role in the January 6 events and the subsequent fallout. She is upset that her image has been damaged by association with his presidency.

"She feels like she's been unfairly blamed for things that were not her fault," said Wolkoff. "She's trying to distance herself from that as much as possible."

Melania Trump has taken note of the attention her successor, Jill Biden, is receiving and contrasts it with her own approach as first lady. She feels that she was overlooked by the media and that her accomplishments were not given the recognition they deserved.

"She's questioning her media strategy now," said Wolkoff. "But she's not taking responsibility for it. She's blaming others for not giving her the coverage she felt she deserved."

Despite feeling overlooked by the media, Melania Trump turned down multiple offers for interviews and magazine features during her time as first lady. She preferred to maintain a low profile and avoid the scrutiny that came with public attention.

"She was very selective about the media she engaged with," said Wolkoff. "She didn't want to be seen as seeking attention or self-promoting."

Melania Trump's post-White House life is a mix of relaxation, regret, and a glimmer of hope for the future. She is seeking to redefine her legacy and find a new path outside the shadow of her husband's presidency.

However, the wounds of the past still linger, and it remains to be seen whether Melania Trump will ever fully escape the controversies that have defined her time in the public eye.
