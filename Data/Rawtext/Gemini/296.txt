California Marks One Year of COVID-19 Vaccinations, Urges Continued Immunity

SACRAMENTO – California today marked the one-year anniversary of the first COVID-19 vaccine administered in the state, with Governor Gavin Newsom releasing an ethnic media column urging Californians to maintain strong immunity through vaccinations and boosters.

"One year ago today, California began the largest and most ambitious vaccination campaign in our state's history," said Governor Newsom. "Since then, we have made tremendous progress, saving countless lives and preventing serious illness."

As of today, over 62.7 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in California, with 86% of all eligible Californians having received at least one dose. More than 6 million adults in the state have also received a COVID-19 booster shot.

Governor Newsom emphasized the importance of vaccination in slowing the spread of the virus and protecting vulnerable communities. "Vaccines are our most powerful tool to fight this pandemic," he said. "They are safe, effective, and free for all Californians."

California has been a leader in vaccine distribution and equity, introducing first-in-the-nation measures such as mandatory vaccinations for healthcare workers and school attendance requirements. The state has also partnered with over 830 faith-based and community organizations to improve vaccination equity and outreach.

In light of rising case rates and hospitalizations, the state has issued new guidance that includes universal indoor mask mandates regardless of vaccination status and updated mega event and travel advisories.

"We are seeing a surge in cases and hospitalizations, driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant," said Governor Newsom. "It is more important than ever to get vaccinated and boosted to protect yourself and your loved ones."

COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are free for all Californians, regardless of insurance or immigration status. Governor Newsom urged all eligible Californians to get vaccinated and receive booster shots as soon as possible.

"We have come a long way in the fight against COVID-19, but we are not out of the woods yet," said Governor Newsom. "Let's continue to work together to protect our communities and save lives."
