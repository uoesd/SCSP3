Tragedy at Austin-East: Student Killed, Officer Injured in School Incident

Knoxville, Tennessee - Classes at Austin-East Magnet High School were canceled for two days following a tragic incident that resulted in the death of a 17-year-old student and the injury of a police officer.

On Monday morning, officers responded to a call of a potentially armed person in the school bathroom. The individual was identified as Anthony J. Thompson Jr., a student at Austin-East.

"We received a call that there was a student who was possibly armed in a bathroom," said Knoxville Police Chief Eve Thomas. "Officers responded and made contact with the student."

According to preliminary findings from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), a struggle ensued between Thompson and the officers. During the altercation, Thompson's gun fired, and an officer returned fire, fatally wounding Thompson at the scene.

"The officer was not struck by gunfire from the suspect," said TBI Director David Rausch. "However, the officer was injured during the incident."

The injured officer, Adam Wilson, was transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the student who lost his life and with the injured officer," said Knox County Schools Superintendent Bob Thomas. "This is a tragic event for our school community and for the entire city."

Austin-East Magnet High School has been plagued by gun violence in recent months, losing four students in separate incidents. The school is a Title 1 school with a focus on performing arts.

"This incident is an officer-involved shooting at a school, not a school shooting," emphasized Rausch. "We are continuing our investigation, and the findings will be shared with the local District Attorney."

Mayor Indya Kincannon expressed her condolences and called for unity in the face of tragedy.

"This is a heartbreaking loss for our community," said Kincannon. "We must work together to stop the violence that is plaguing our city."

The Knoxville Fire Department has trained extensively for incidents like this and described their response as successful.

"We were able to quickly evacuate the school and provide medical assistance to the injured officer," said Captain Corcoran of the Knoxville Fire Department. "Our training and preparation paid off today."

The TBI is continuing its investigation, and the findings will be shared with the local District Attorney.
