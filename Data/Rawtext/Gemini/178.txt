Legendary ZZ Top Bassist Dusty Hill Dies at 72

Houston, TX – The music world mourns the loss of Dusty Hill, the iconic bassist of ZZ Top, who passed away at the age of 72.

"We are saddened by the news today that our Compadre, Dusty Hill, has passed away in his sleep at his home in Houston," bandmates Billy Gibbons and Frank Beard announced on Facebook. "We, along with legions of ZZ Top fans around the world, will miss your steadfast presence, your good nature and enduring commitment to providing that monumental bottom to the 'Top'."

The cause of Hill's death was not disclosed. He had recently been recovering from a hip injury that forced the band to cancel some tour dates.

Born Joe Michael Hill in Dallas, Texas, Hill joined ZZ Top in 1970, replacing original bassist Billy Ethridge. He became an integral part of the band's signature sound, which blended blues, rock, and boogie.

ZZ Top released 15 studio albums, including the highly successful "Eliminator" (1983), which sold over 10 million copies and featured the hit singles "Sharp Dressed Man" and "Legs." The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.

Hill was renowned for his trademark beard, which he and Gibbons grew out in the 1970s. In 1984, Gillette offered the duo $1 million to shave their beards, but they famously declined.

"We're not going to sell our beards," Gibbons said at the time. "They're part of our image."

During Hill's recent health-related absence from the tour, he was replaced by the band's guitar tech, Elwood Francis.

"Dusty gave us a heads up about a month ago that he was not going to be able to make the tour," Beard said. "We respected his wishes and we knew he wasn't feeling very well."

Hill's passing leaves a void in the music industry and among his countless fans. His legacy as a legendary bassist and a beloved member of ZZ Top will live on forever.

"Dusty Hill was a true pioneer of the bass guitar," Gibbons said. "His sound and style were unique and instantly recognizable. He was a master of his craft and a true gentleman."

"We will miss him dearly," Beard added. "But his music will continue to inspire and entertain generations to come."
