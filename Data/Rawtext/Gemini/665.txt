Rittenhouse's Bond Modified Amidst White Supremacy Allegations

Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old accused of killing two and injuring one during the Kenosha protests, has had his bond modified after prosecutors alleged his association with white supremacist groups.

Bond Modification Motion

Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas C. Binge filed an affidavit seeking to modify Rittenhouse's bond after observing him at a bar. Binge noted that Rittenhouse was seen interacting with adults singing a Proud Boys anthem and posing with an "OK" hand gesture, which is often associated with white supremacy.

"The defendant's conduct demonstrates his continued association with individuals who hold extremist views," Binge wrote in the affidavit.

Defense Response

Rittenhouse's defense attorney, Mark Richards, vehemently denied the allegations, stating that his client has no ties to any far-right groups. Richards also criticized the motion as an attempt to inject race into a self-defense case.

"This is nothing more than a desperate attempt to smear Kyle Rittenhouse and prejudice the jury," Richards said.

Bond Conditions

The modified bond conditions prohibit Rittenhouse from consuming alcohol, frequenting bars, and associating with white supremacist groups. Richards agreed to the modification, but objected to the association restriction.

Alcohol Consumption

Wisconsin law allows individuals aged 18-20 to drink alcohol under parental supervision. Richards argued that Rittenhouse's bar visit did not violate his bond conditions, as he was accompanied by his mother.

Alleged Militia Involvement

Prosecutors also alleged that Rittenhouse joined right-wing militias during the Kenosha protest. However, Richards stated that there is no evidence to support this claim and that Rittenhouse does not follow any such groups on social media.

Defense Threats

Rittenhouse's defense team has threatened legal action against those who continue to accuse him of white supremacy.

"We will not tolerate these baseless and defamatory attacks on Kyle Rittenhouse," Richards said.

Plea and Trial

Rittenhouse pleaded not guilty to all charges against him. His trial is scheduled to begin on November 1.
