Ransomware Attacks Spur Lawsuits as Companies Face Liability for Lost Sales, Disrupted Services

In the wake of the devastating ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, which caused widespread fuel shortages along the East Coast, a growing number of lawsuits are emerging against companies for damages stemming from such cyberattacks.

One such lawsuit was filed by Eddie Darwich, owner of an EZ Mart fuel station in Wilmington, North Carolina. Darwich claims that the attack on Colonial Pipeline led to a significant loss of sales at his station, as customers were unable to purchase fuel.

"I lost a lot of money because of this attack," Darwich said. "I had to close my station for several days, and I'm still struggling to recover."

The Colonial Pipeline attack is just one example of the increasing frequency and severity of ransomware attacks. In recent years, companies across various industries, including healthcare, education, and government, have been targeted by these malicious attacks.

Ransomware attacks typically involve hackers locking users out of their systems and demanding payment in exchange for restoring access. This can disrupt services beyond just data theft, as was the case with the Colonial Pipeline attack, which affected fuel supply, and the Scripps Health attack, which disrupted hospital operations.

The rise in ransomware attacks has led to a corresponding increase in lawsuits against companies for failing to protect their systems adequately. Historically, companies have faced lawsuits for cybersecurity lapses, such as the Target and Home Depot breaches, which resulted in settlements worth millions of dollars.

However, the recent lawsuits against Colonial Pipeline and Scripps Health indicate that companies could now be liable for broader damages caused by cybersecurity failures.

"Companies are now being held accountable for the full range of damages caused by ransomware attacks," said John Yanchunis, a veteran class-action lawyer with Morgan & Morgan. "This includes not only the cost of restoring systems but also lost sales, reputational damage, and other consequential losses."

Yanchunis criticized the level of cybersecurity measures in many companies, stating that protection is often insufficient.

"Companies need to invest more in cybersecurity and take a more proactive approach to protecting their systems," he said.

The legal and public perception of damages from cyber breaches has evolved in recent years, with courts increasingly recognizing the tangible harm they can cause.

"The courts are starting to understand that cyberattacks can have a devastating impact on businesses and individuals," said Daniel Solove, a professor at George Washington University Law School and founder of TeachPrivacy. "This is leading to a more expansive view of the damages that can be recovered in these cases."

Settlements are common in these cases as companies aim to avoid costly and long court battles. The Colonial Pipeline lawsuit, for example, was settled for $4.4 million.

The increase in ransomware attacks has prompted discussions on legislative solutions and the challenges in achieving fail-proof security systems.

"There is no such thing as perfect security," Solove said. "But companies need to do more to protect their systems and mitigate the risks of ransomware attacks."

As ransomware attacks continue to pose a significant threat to businesses and individuals, it is likely that the legal landscape will continue to evolve, with companies facing increased liability for damages caused by cybersecurity failures.
