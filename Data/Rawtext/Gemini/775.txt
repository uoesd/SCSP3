'Rust' Tragedy: A Cautionary Tale of Ignored Safety Protocols

CNN – As a union prop master with over two decades of experience, I am deeply saddened and disturbed by the tragic shooting incident on the set of the film 'Rust'. The death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and the injury of director Joel Souza are a stark reminder of the paramount importance of safety protocols in our industry.

My experience on 'Saturday Night Live' has instilled in me an unwavering commitment to safety. The show's rigorous protocols and team cohesion create an environment where everyone feels empowered to speak up about potential hazards. In contrast, media reports and inside accounts of the 'Rust' set paint a disturbing picture of long days, insufficient accommodations, and low morale.

Assistant Director David Halls, who handed Alec Baldwin the fatal gun, admitted to not checking all the rounds, according to a search warrant affidavit. This admission is a glaring violation of basic firearm safety protocols. Moreover, Halls had a history of disregarding safety protocols, and there were two previous accidental discharges on the 'Rust' set.

Hannah Gutierrez, the armorer on 'Rust', was relatively inexperienced, having only one other stint as head armorer. While inexperience alone does not excuse negligence, it raises questions about the level of supervision and training she received.

The 'Rust' tragedy is an ironic and cautionary tale. The film industry is often glamorized, but it is essential to remember that it is a workplace where dangerous equipment is used. Respect for worker safety must be paramount to prevent fatal accidents.

In the prop master's profession, admitting ignorance and seeking help are crucial. We must never assume we know everything. When it comes to firearm safety, there is no room for complacency. Patience, fairness, and adherence to safety protocols are the cornerstones of successful and safe film production.

The 'Rust' tragedy should serve as a wake-up call for the entire film industry. We must prioritize safety above all else. This means investing in training, providing adequate resources, and fostering a culture where everyone feels comfortable speaking up about potential hazards.

We owe it to Halyna Hutchins, her family, and all those who work in our industry to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again.
