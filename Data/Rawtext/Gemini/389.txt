Facebook Removes Thousands of Fake Review Groups After CMA Intervention

Facebook has removed over 16,000 groups involved in the illegal trade of fake reviews, following criticism from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

In January 2020, Facebook agreed to better identify and remove groups where fraudulent reviews were being traded. However, a follow-up investigation by the CMA found that the illegal trade was still occurring on the platform.

"We are disappointed that Facebook did not take sufficient action to address our concerns," said Andrea Coscelli, Chief Executive of the CMA. "We have therefore forced Facebook to make a second commitment to tackle this issue."

Facebook has now committed to suspending or banning users involved in trading fake reviews and has introduced new technology to automatically flag such groups.

"We have extensively engaged with the CMA and we are committed to ensuring that fraudulent activities are not allowed on our platforms," said a Facebook spokesperson.

The issue of fake reviews is widespread across the internet, impacting various e-commerce sites. A Which? investigation in October 2018 found Facebook "factories" producing fake reviews for Amazon.

The investigation found that 71% of headphones on Amazon had perfect five-star ratings, often referring to unrelated products and overwhelmingly unverified.

"Fake reviews mislead consumers and undermine trust in online marketplaces," said Coscelli. "We will continue to take action against any company that fails to protect consumers from this illegal practice."

Facebook's removal of fake review groups is a significant step in addressing the issue. However, it remains to be seen whether the new measures will be effective in preventing the illegal trade from continuing.

The CMA has warned that it will take further action if Facebook does not comply with its commitments.

"We will not hesitate to take further action if we find that Facebook is not doing enough to tackle this problem," said Coscelli.
