Harris' 'The View' Interview Delayed as Co-Hosts Test Positive for COVID-19

Vice President Kamala Harris' scheduled interview on ABC's "The View" was abruptly delayed on Tuesday after co-hosts Sunny Hostin and Ana Navarro tested positive for COVID-19. The fully vaccinated hosts experienced "breakthrough" infections and abruptly left the show.

"We just found out that Sunny and Ana have both tested positive for COVID," co-host Joy Behar informed viewers. "They're both fully vaccinated, so they're feeling fine, but of course, we're sending them all our love."

To ensure the safety of Vice President Harris, the interview was conducted remotely within the studio's building. "We're taking every precaution to keep everyone safe," Behar added.

Harris emphasized the importance of vaccinations, attributing the non-severe status of the co-hosts to being vaccinated. "This is a reminder that even if you're vaccinated, you can still get COVID," she said. "But the vaccines are working, and they're saving lives."

Deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed that Harris had not contacted the hosts prior to the show and that her schedule would proceed as planned. "The Vice President's health and safety are our top priority," Singh said.

During her appearance, Harris addressed crucial issues like COVID-19, immigration, and foreign aid. She criticized the aggressive actions of border agents against Haitian migrants, likening it to dark episodes of American history. "We have to hold people accountable," she said. "We have to make sure that there are consequences for those who violate the rights of others."

Harris also called for increased assistance for Haiti to help the nation recover from natural disasters and political instability. "We need to be there for the people of Haiti," she said. "We need to help them rebuild their lives and their country."

Despite the disruption, Harris' appearance on "The View" allowed her to address important issues and highlight the importance of vaccinations.
