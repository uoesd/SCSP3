Gabby Petito Last Seen in Utah, Search Shifts to Wyoming

SALT LAKE CITY – FOX 13 News has confirmed that Gabby Petito was last seen at a Fairfield Inn and Suites near Salt Lake City International Airport on August 24. Hotel staff reported that the FBI and police officers recently visited the hotel and confirmed that Petito stayed there for more than a day.

The search for Petito has shifted focus to Wyoming, following her last known communications. Her stepfather, James Schmidt, emphasized law enforcement's efforts in the search and their collective work.

"They're doing everything they can," Schmidt said. "We're just trying to stay positive and hope for the best."

Richard Stafford, a spokesman for the Petito family, criticized Brian Laundrie, Petito's boyfriend, for not cooperating with the police.

"We're frustrated that Brian Laundrie has not come forward to help us find Gabby," Stafford said. "He's a person of interest, and we believe he knows more than he's letting on."

Laundrie has been named a person of interest but not a suspect in Petito's disappearance. He returned home in early September without Petito and has since hired a lawyer and refused to cooperate with police.

Petito was reported missing on September 11. Her family and friends have been desperately searching for her since then.

"We just want to find Gabby and bring her home," Schmidt said. "We're not going to give up until we do."

The FBI is leading the investigation into Petito's disappearance. They are asking for the public's help in locating her. Anyone with information is urged to contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI.

Petito is described as a 22-year-old white female, approximately 5 feet 5 inches tall and 110 pounds. She has blonde hair and blue eyes. She was last seen wearing a black tank top and black shorts.

The search for Petito is ongoing. Her family and friends are hopeful that she will be found safe and sound.

"We're not going to give up until we find Gabby," Stafford said. "We're going to keep fighting for her."
