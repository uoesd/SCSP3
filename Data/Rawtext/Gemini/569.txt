Deadly Kabul School Bombing Kills Over 85, Mostly Students

KABUL – A horrific bombing at a school in Kabul's Hazara neighborhood on Saturday claimed the lives of more than 85 people, the majority of whom were students. The attack has sent shockwaves through Afghanistan and heightened fears among the Hazara community about their vulnerability amid the withdrawal of international forces.

The victims were predominantly schoolgirls aged 13 to 18, a fact that has stunned both Afghans and the international community. The attack occurred as students were taking a practice university entrance exam, turning a day of hope and anticipation into a scene of unspeakable tragedy.

"It was a horrific scene," said Mohammad Hedayt, a spokesman for Vice President Sarwar Danish. "There were bodies everywhere, and the air was filled with the screams of the injured."

The Hazara community, a Shia Muslim minority group, has long faced persecution and discrimination in Afghanistan. They fear that the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops will leave them exposed to increased attacks and a return to the Taliban's brutal rule.

"We feel abandoned," said Mukhtar Alizada, whose sister Nekbakht was killed in the bombing. "The international community has turned its back on us, and now we are at the mercy of the Taliban."

Nekbakht, a bright and ambitious 17-year-old, was passionate about education and dreamed of becoming a doctor. Her family is devastated by her loss and determined to continue educating their children, despite the risks.

"Nekbakht loved learning," said Alizada. "She believed that education was the only way to a better future for our people."

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has blamed the Taliban. The Taliban has denied involvement, but experts warn that the withdrawal of foreign forces could create instability, allowing groups like the Islamic State to grow stronger.

"The withdrawal of international forces is creating a vacuum that could be exploited by terrorist groups," said Torek Farhadi, a former Afghan government official. "The Islamic State has already claimed responsibility for several attacks targeting civilians in western Kabul, home to many Hazaras and Shiites."

Despite the risks, Nekbakht's family is determined to continue educating their children. They believe that education is the only path to a better future for the Hazara community.

"We will not be deterred by these attacks," said Alizada. "We will continue to send our children to school, because we believe that education is the key to a better life."

The international community has condemned the attack and called for those responsible to be brought to justice. However, many Afghans fear that the withdrawal of foreign forces will lead to a resurgence of violence and a return to the dark days of the Taliban's rule.

"We are at a crossroads," said Farhadi. "The international community must not abandon Afghanistan. We need their support to build a stable and prosperous future for all Afghans."

An intense diplomatic push for a peace deal between the Taliban and the Afghan government has so far been unsuccessful. The Taliban has refused to negotiate with the government, which it considers a U.S. puppet.

"The Taliban is not interested in peace," said Hedayt. "They are only interested in power."

The bombing has shattered the hopes of many Afghans for a peaceful future. The Hazara community, in particular, feels abandoned and vulnerable. They fear that the withdrawal of international forces will leave them at the mercy of the Taliban and other extremist groups.

"We are living in fear," said Alizada. "We don't know what the future holds, but we are determined to continue fighting for our rights and our future."
