UAE Secures F-35, Reaper Deal in Last-Minute Trump Administration Move

WASHINGTON – The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has signed a deal to purchase up to 50 F-35 jets and 18 MQ-9 Reaper drones from the United States, just one hour before President Joe Biden's inauguration.

The agreement, solidified through a letter of agreement between US and UAE officials, details the terms of the sale. The specifics, including cost and technical specifications, have been established, but the first delivery date, potentially in 2027, remains unconfirmed.

The sale is valued at approximately $23.37 billion, encompassing aircraft, drones, and a wide array of munitions. Future negotiations could adjust the financial details of the agreement, particularly with Lockheed Martin and General Atomics.

The Biden administration's stance on the deal is unclear, though it has expressed intentions to review it carefully. Antony Blinken, Biden's nominee for Secretary of State, emphasized the need to maintain Israel's qualitative military edge when considering the sale.

The US Senate failed to block the sale in December, with votes showing a partisan split favoring the deal. Requests for comments from the departments of State and Defense went unanswered.

The F-35 is a fifth-generation fighter jet known for its advanced stealth capabilities and sensor fusion technology. The MQ-9 Reaper is a remotely piloted aircraft used for surveillance and strike missions.

The deal is seen as a significant step in strengthening the US-UAE relationship and enhancing the UAE's defense capabilities. However, it has also raised concerns among some who believe it could upset the regional balance of power and potentially lead to arms proliferation.

The Biden administration is expected to conduct a thorough review of the deal, considering its implications for regional stability and the US's commitment to Israel's security. The outcome of this review will determine the fate of the agreement.
