Ida's Wrath Unleashes Devastation in Mullica Hill and South Jersey

HARRISON TWP. – The remnants of Hurricane Ida left a trail of destruction across Mullica Hill and other South Jersey towns, flattening homes, uprooting trees, and leaving thousands without power.

Harrison Hit Hard

Harrison Township Mayor Louis Manzo described the damage in his town as "unprecedented."

"We've had a dozen houses flattened," Manzo said. "It's like a war zone."

Miraculously, no fatalities have been reported in Harrison. However, two individuals were hospitalized in Gloucester County due to storm-related injuries.

Tornado Warnings and Possible Twisters

Multiple tornado warnings were issued during the storm, with possible tornadoes reported in Cherry Hill and near the Delaware River in Burlington County.

U.S. Rep. Andy Kim, who represents New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District, reported seeing a tornado near his home in Cherry Hill.

"I saw a tornado with my own eyes," Kim said. "It was a surreal and terrifying experience."

Kim urged residents to stay safe and reach out for help if needed.

Widespread Damage and Hazardous Conditions

Fallen trees, closed roads, and downed power lines were widespread, creating hazardous conditions throughout the region.

Burlington County spokesman Dave Levinsky said the county was experiencing "significant" damage.

"We have trees down everywhere, roads closed, and power outages," Levinsky said. "We're urging residents to stay off the roads and be cautious."

First Responders and Red Cross Provide Assistance

First responders and the Red Cross were actively providing assistance and emergency housing to those affected by the storm.

The Red Cross opened shelters at the Harrison Township Municipal Building and the Gloucester County College Student Center.

Murphy Promises Support

Gov. Phil Murphy visited Mullica Hill on Thursday to assess the damage and meet with local officials.

"We will do everything we can to support the response and recovery efforts," Murphy said. "We will not leave anyone behind."

Drenching Rainfall and Gusty Winds Forecast

The National Weather Service is forecasting drenching rainfall, severe thunderstorms, and gusts up to 25 mph for the area over the next few days.

Residents are urged to be prepared for additional flooding and power outages.

Increased Tornado Activity in New Jersey

New Jersey has seen a significant increase in tornado activity in 2021, with 10 tornadoes already reported.

This is the highest number of tornadoes in the state since 2010, when 12 tornadoes were recorded.

Experts attribute the increase in tornado activity to climate change, which is leading to more frequent and intense storms.

Residents Urged to Stay Safe and Seek Help

Residents are urged to stay safe, avoid downed power lines, and report any damage to their local authorities.
