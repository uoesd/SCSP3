Hochul Sworn In as New York's First Female Governor

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) – Kathy Hochul was sworn in as New York's first female governor on Tuesday, taking over after Andrew Cuomo resigned amid sexual harassment allegations.

Hochul, a Democrat who had been serving as lieutenant governor, was sworn in during a private ceremony overseen by Chief Judge Janet DiFiore.

"This is a historic moment for New York," DiFiore said. "Kathy Hochul is a trailblazer who has broken down barriers and shattered glass ceilings."

Hochul, 62, takes over at a time when New York is facing a number of challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, economic instability, and a housing crisis.

In her inaugural address, Hochul outlined her plans to address these challenges and change the governance culture in Albany.

"We need to restore trust in government," Hochul said. "We need to be transparent, accountable, and responsive to the needs of the people."

Hochul said she will take a different approach to the COVID-19 pandemic than Cuomo, who had been criticized for his handling of the crisis. Hochul said she will require all schoolchildren to wear masks and will work to increase the state's vaccination rate.

"We need to follow the science and do everything we can to protect the health of our people," Hochul said.

Hochul also said she will work to address the state's economic problems. She said she will focus on creating jobs, supporting small businesses, and making New York more affordable.

"We need to make sure that everyone has a fair shot at success," Hochul said.

Hochul's swearing-in marks a historic moment for New York. She is the first woman to hold the office of governor in the state's history.

"This is a proud day for New York," said Assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou. "Kathy Hochul is a strong and capable leader who will fight for the people of this state."

Cuomo, who resigned on Monday, defended his record in a farewell address. He dismissed the sexual harassment allegations against him as a "political firecracker."

"I did not do what has been alleged," Cuomo said. "I never harassed anyone. I never abused anyone."

Cuomo also said he was proud of his accomplishments as governor, including his work on the economy, education, and healthcare.

"I have always put the people of New York first," Cuomo said. "I have always fought for what I believe in."

Cuomo is facing a number of legal challenges, including allegations that he groped a former aide and that he misled the public about the number of nursing home deaths from COVID-19.

Melissa DeRosa, a top aide to Cuomo, said she believes the allegations against him are false.

"I have known the governor for many years," DeRosa said. "He is a good man who has always been committed to serving the people of New York."

Jay Jacobs, the state Democratic Party chair, said he believes Hochul will be a successful governor.

"Kathy Hochul is a smart and experienced leader," Jacobs said. "She is the right person to lead New York at this time."

Hochul said she is committed to changing the governance culture in Albany. She said she will appoint new aides and review the current staff.

"We need to create a culture of respect and integrity," Hochul said. "We need to work together to build a better future for New York."
