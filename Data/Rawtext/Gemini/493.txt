Hurricane Ida's Remnants Unleash Devastating Floods, Tornadoes Across East Coast, Killing at Least 46

NEW YORK (AP) – The remnants of Hurricane Ida unleashed devastating floods and tornado damage across the U.S. East Coast, leaving a trail of destruction and claiming the lives of at least 46 people.

New Jersey bore the brunt of the storm's fury, with at least 23 fatalities reported. Governor Phil Murphy described the situation as "heartbreaking," saying, "We're praying for the families who've lost loved ones."

New York City also suffered significant losses, with 13 people killed, 11 of whom perished in flooded basement apartments. Mayor Bill de Blasio lamented, "This is a tragedy for our city. We're doing everything we can to help those affected."

Flooding and damage were widespread across multiple states, including Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. In Elizabeth, New Jersey, Mayor J. Christian Bollwage said, "We've never seen anything like this before. The water rose so quickly, people couldn't escape."

Sophy Liu, a survivor from Elizabeth, recounted her harrowing experience: "The water came in so fast, I had to climb onto my kitchen counter. I was trapped for hours, waiting for help."

Deborah Torres, another survivor from New York City, described the terrifying moment when her basement apartment flooded: "I heard a loud noise, and then the water just started gushing in. I grabbed my children and ran for our lives."

Experts attributed the storm's devastating impact to climate change. "Warmer air can hold more rain, and urban settings like New York City exacerbate flooding due to extensive pavement," explained Jeanine Zubrzycki, a resident of Mullica Hill, New Jersey.

Despite warnings from the National Hurricane Center about potential flash flooding, officials in New York expressed surprise at the storm's ferocity. "We knew there was a risk of flooding, but we didn't anticipate it would be this severe," said Governor Kathy Hochul.

The storm's aftermath left a chaotic scene in New York City. Nearly 500 vehicles were abandoned on flooded highways, and subway service was disrupted due to water entering the tunnels. Chief of Department Rodney Harrison said, "We've never had to deal with this volume of water in the subway system before."

President Joe Biden responded to the crisis, declaring a state of emergency in New Jersey and New York. "We're going to do everything we can to help these communities recover and rebuild," he said.

Federal first responders have been deployed to assist in cleanup efforts. Greg Turner, whose father was killed in the flooding in New Jersey, expressed gratitude for the support: "We're devastated, but we're also grateful for the help we're receiving."

The storm also spawned at least 10 tornadoes across the region, causing additional damage. This disaster follows just days after Ida made landfall in Louisiana as the fifth-strongest storm ever to hit the U.S.

As the cleanup and recovery efforts continue, officials are urging residents to stay vigilant and follow safety guidelines. "This storm has shown us the importance of being prepared for extreme weather events," said Mayor de Blasio. "We need to learn from this and take steps to mitigate the risks in the future."
