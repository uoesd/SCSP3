Harris Condemns Trump's 'Bald-Faced' Abuse of Power in Georgia Election Call

Savannah, Georgia - Vice President-elect Kamala Harris has denounced President Donald Trump's phone call urging Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the election results as a "bald-faced, bold abuse of power."

Speaking at a drive-thru rally in Savannah, Harris excoriated Trump's attempts to subvert the democratic process. "This is not just about Georgia. This is about the integrity of our elections," she declared.

The recorded conversation between Trump and Raffensperger, obtained by CNN and reported by the Washington Post, has sparked widespread outrage. Trump repeatedly pressured Raffensperger to "find" enough votes to overturn Biden's victory in Georgia, a request the secretary of state firmly rejected.

"This is a disgraceful story about Donald Trump's assault on American democracy," said Bob Bauer, senior adviser to President-elect Joe Biden.

Harris highlighted the failed attempts by Trump and other Republicans to overturn the election results on baseless voter fraud allegations. "They have tried every trick in the book, but they have failed," she said. "The people have spoken, and their voices will not be silenced."

Georgia played a pivotal role in electing Biden and Harris, and Harris criticized the opposition's questioning of the electoral process. "Georgia showed the world that our democracy is strong," she said. "We will not let anyone undermine our right to vote."

Trump's January 2 audio call with Raffensperger, along with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and several lawyers, was leaked and reported. In the call, Trump made numerous false claims about the election and pressured Raffensperger to change the results.

Harris also condemned Trump's claims that the January 5 Senate runoff elections were "illegal and invalid." "These are baseless attacks on our democracy," she said. "We will not let him steal this election."

Addressing future representation, Harris expressed concern over the absence of a Black woman in the Senate after her resignation. "It is imperative that we have a voice for the voiceless," she said.

Senate candidate Jon Ossoff accused Trump of attempting to disenfranchise Black voters and criticized Sens. Perdue and Loeffler for not defending Georgia voters. "They have put their own political ambitions ahead of the people they represent," he said.

Harris's remarks come amid growing calls for Trump to be held accountable for his actions. The House of Representatives has impeached Trump for inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, and the Senate is expected to hold a trial soon.

The Georgia election call has further fueled the debate over Trump's fitness for office and the need to protect the integrity of American elections. Harris's condemnation of Trump's actions sends a clear message that the incoming Biden-Harris administration will not tolerate any attempts to undermine democracy.
