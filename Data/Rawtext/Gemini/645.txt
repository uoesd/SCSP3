Rittenhouse Barred from White Supremacist Groups Under Modified Bail Conditions

KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) – Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager charged with fatally shooting two people during a Wisconsin protest, is now prohibited from associating with known white supremacists as part of his modified bail conditions.

Rittenhouse, 17 at the time of the shootings, faces charges including reckless and intentional homicide, endangerment, and being a minor in possession of a firearm. Prosecutors allege he traveled from Illinois to Wisconsin and joined militia groups to protect businesses during protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man.

Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty, asserting he acted in self-defense. However, his bail conditions were modified after he was seen drinking in a bar and posing for a photo making a symbol used by white supremacists.

The modifications explicitly prohibit Rittenhouse from associating with groups known to harass others based on race, religion, color, national origin, or gender. He is also barred from possessing firearms and consuming alcohol.

The bail condition modifications were requested following Rittenhouse's bar visit, where he interacted with individuals linked to white supremacist groups. The judge presiding over the case expressed concern that Rittenhouse's actions could jeopardize the safety of the community.

Rittenhouse's case has drawn significant attention, with conservatives rallying to support him. They argue that he was acting in self-defense and that the charges against him are politically motivated. However, prosecutors maintain that Rittenhouse's actions were reckless and that he should be held accountable for the deaths of two people.

The trial is scheduled to begin on November 1, 2021. Rittenhouse remains in custody, and his bail has been set at $2 million.

The modified bail conditions are intended to ensure that Rittenhouse does not engage in any further conduct that could threaten the safety of the community or interfere with the administration of justice. The judge has warned Rittenhouse that any violation of these conditions could result in his bail being revoked and him being returned to custody.
