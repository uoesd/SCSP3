Oprah's Sussex Interview Scores Emmy Nomination

The bombshell interview between Oprah Winfrey and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, has been nominated for an Emmy Award. The interview, which aired in March 2021, has been nominated in the category of Outstanding Hosted Nonfiction Series or Special.

The Emmys, which celebrate excellence in US television, will be presented on September 12th. If victorious, Oprah Winfrey and the producing team behind the interview will receive the award. The special faces competition from notable series such as My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman.

The Sussex interview sent shockwaves through the British monarchy and beyond. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made significant allegations against the royal family, including concerns about racism regarding their son Archie's skin tone and Meghan's claims of being refused help for suicidal thoughts.

Prince Harry also expressed feeling "let down" by his father, Prince Charles, and mentioned a strained relationship. Buckingham Palace responded to the allegations, noting the Queen's sadness and mentioning that "recollections may vary."

The interview has been praised for its raw honesty and for shedding light on the challenges faced by the couple within the royal family. It has also been criticized by some for its timing, coming just months before the death of Prince Philip.

The Emmy nomination is a testament to the impact of the interview and its significance in the ongoing conversation about race, mental health, and the role of the media in holding the powerful to account.

The Crown and The Mandalorian lead the Emmy nominations with 24 each. Other notable nominees include Ted Lasso, The White Lotus, and Succession. The full list of nominees can be found on the Emmy website.

The Emmy Awards will be presented at a ceremony in Los Angeles on September 12th. The ceremony will be hosted by Kenan Thompson and will air on NBC.
