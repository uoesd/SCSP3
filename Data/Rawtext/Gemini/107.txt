CNN's Cuomo Interviews Now Seen as Inappropriate Amid Nursing Home Scandal

NEW YORK (AP) – CNN's Chris Cuomo's interviews with his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, are now seen unfavorably due to the governor's COVID-19 nursing home deaths scandal.

CNN has banned Chris Cuomo from interviewing or covering stories about his brother, a policy that was temporarily lifted in 2020. The Cuomo brothers' interviews last spring were characterized by their lighthearted banter but are now criticized as inappropriate.

"It's a conflict of interest," said Roy Gutterman, a media law professor at Syracuse University. "It's hard to imagine that Chris Cuomo would ask his brother tough questions."

The Cuomo administration is accused of undercounting COVID-19 deaths of nursing home residents to avoid blame for policies that forced nursing homes to accept infected patients. New York's attorney general reported the administration's undercounting of deaths; the governor blames nursing home staff for virus spread.

An Andrew Cuomo aide admitted they withheld the true nursing home death toll out of fear it would be used against them by Trump's Justice Department.

CNN has covered the nursing home death scandal on programs other than Chris Cuomo's, with anchors openly inviting the governor to respond. Jake Tapper criticized Governor Cuomo for a bad decision that may have cost lives and accused his administration of hiding data.

Chris Cuomo has defended his interviews with his brother as significant and entertaining but has followed CNN's policy to not cover related scandals.

Cuomo Interviews Once Seen as Lighthearted Now Criticized as Inappropriate

The Cuomo brothers' interviews last spring were seen as a way for the governor to connect with the public during a difficult time. The interviews were often lighthearted, with the brothers joking and bantering.

But in light of the nursing home scandal, the interviews are now seen as inappropriate. Critics argue that Chris Cuomo was too soft on his brother and failed to ask him tough questions about the administration's handling of the pandemic.

"It's clear that Chris Cuomo was not doing his job as a journalist," said Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at New York University. "He was more interested in protecting his brother than in getting to the truth."

CNN Bans Chris Cuomo from Covering Brother

In May 2021, CNN banned Chris Cuomo from interviewing or covering stories about his brother. The network said the decision was made to avoid any potential conflicts of interest.

The ban was temporarily lifted in 2020, when Chris Cuomo interviewed his brother about his handling of the pandemic. But the interviews were widely criticized, and CNN decided to reinstate the ban.

Chris Cuomo Defends Interviews

Chris Cuomo has defended his interviews with his brother, saying they were significant and entertaining. He has also said that he followed CNN's policy to not cover related scandals.

"I never intended to violate CNN's policy," Cuomo said in a statement. "I always tried to be transparent about my relationship with my brother and to avoid any conflicts of interest."

Nursing Home Scandal Continues to Unfold

The nursing home death scandal continues to unfold, with new revelations emerging on a regular basis. The New York attorney general's investigation is ongoing, and the governor is facing calls to resign.

The scandal has also raised questions about the role of the media in covering stories involving powerful figures. Critics argue that the media has been too soft on Governor Cuomo and has failed to hold him accountable for his actions.

CNN Covers Scandal on Other Programs

CNN has covered the nursing home death scandal on programs other than Chris Cuomo's. Anchors on these programs have openly invited the governor to respond to the allegations against him.

Jake Tapper, the host of CNN's "The Lead," has been particularly critical of Governor Cuomo. In a recent segment, Tapper accused the governor of making a bad decision that may have cost lives.

"The governor's decision to force nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients was a mistake," Tapper said. "It's clear that this decision led to the deaths of thousands of elderly New Yorkers."

Governor Cuomo Blames Nursing Home Staff

Governor Cuomo has blamed nursing home staff for the spread of COVID-19 in these facilities. He has said that the staff failed to follow proper infection control protocols.

But critics argue that the governor is trying to shift blame away from his administration. They say that the administration's policies, such as the decision to force nursing homes to accept infected patients, led to the deaths of thousands of elderly New Yorkers.

Aide Admits Withholding True Death Toll

An aide to Governor Cuomo has admitted that the administration withheld the true nursing home death toll out of fear it would be used against them by Trump's Justice Department.

The aide, Melissa DeRosa, made the admission in a phone call with Democratic state lawmakers. She
