Joint Chiefs Reaffirm Commitment to Constitution, Peaceful Transfer of Power

Washington, D.C. - The Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a powerful message to U.S. troops on January 12, 2021, underscoring their unwavering commitment to the Constitution and the peaceful transfer of power.

In a memo signed by all eight Joint Chiefs, the military's top leaders emphasized the military's obligation to obey lawful civilian leadership and support civil authorities in protecting lives and property. They condemned the January 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol as a "direct assault" on Congress, the Capitol building, and the Constitutional process.

The memo mourned the deaths of two Capitol policemen and others connected to the events of January 6. It condemned the violence and breaches of the rule of law witnessed during the riot, stating that freedom of speech and assembly do not grant the right to violence, sedition, and insurrection.

The Joint Chiefs reminded service members of their duty to embody the nation's values and ideals, and to uphold their oath to defend the Constitution. They confirmed that President-elect Biden will be inaugurated on January 20, 2021, becoming the 46th Commander in Chief.

Troops, whether deployed or at home, were urged to stay ready, focused, and honor their service in defense of American democratic principles. The Joint Chiefs' message serves as a stern reminder of the military's role in upholding democracy and the rule of law.

"We are committed to protecting and defending the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic," the memo stated. "We will not tolerate violence, sedition, and insurrection within our ranks."

The Joint Chiefs' message comes at a critical time for the nation, as it grapples with the aftermath of the Capitol riot and the ongoing challenges to American democracy. The military's unwavering commitment to the Constitution and the peaceful transfer of power is a reassuring sign that the nation's armed forces remain steadfast in their defense of democratic principles.
