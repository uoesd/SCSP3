Tiger Woods' Recovery: Justin Thomas Offers Hopeful Update

Nine months after his devastating car accident in Los Angeles, Tiger Woods has maintained a low public profile, leaving fans and the media speculating about his recovery. While details have been scarce, occasional updates from fellow golfers have provided glimpses into Woods' progress.

Justin Thomas, a close friend of Woods and fellow PGA Tour pro, has been a frequent visitor to Woods' home, providing more regular updates due to their close contact. In a recent interview on the No Laying Up podcast, Thomas shared some encouraging news about Woods' recovery.

"I see him two to three times a week," Thomas said. "He's doing well. He's getting stronger. He's able to do more and more."

Thomas noted that Woods is now able to participate in his children's activities, indicating some level of improvement in his mobility. "He's able to be a dad, which is the most important thing," Thomas said.

Despite the challenges he has faced, Woods' personality remains unchanged. "He's still the same old Tiger," Thomas said. "He's still got his sense of humor. He's still the same guy."

While there is still uncertainty regarding Woods' future in professional golf, Thomas believes Woods will attempt a comeback if possible. "I think he's going to try to play again," Thomas said. "I don't know if he'll be able to, but I think he's going to try."

However, Woods' priorities have shifted since the accident. "He's a dad first," Thomas said. "Golf is secondary."

Woods' next public appearance might be at the Hero World Challenge next month, where he serves as tournament host. While his participation in the event is still uncertain, it would provide a glimpse into his recovery and his plans for the future.

Thomas' interview also covered topics beyond Woods, including his own season, mental health, and views on the state of golf.

"I'm excited about the future of golf," Thomas said. "I think it's in a really good place."

Thomas also spoke about the importance of mental health in golf, saying, "It's something that we all deal with, and it's something that we need to talk about more."

Thomas' interview provided a rare and insightful update on Tiger Woods' recovery and his future in golf. While the road ahead may be uncertain, Thomas' optimism and Woods' unwavering determination offer hope for a possible return to the game he loves.
