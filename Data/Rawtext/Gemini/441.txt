Prince Harry Returns to UK for Prince Philip's Funeral, Meghan Markle Stays Behind in US

Prince Harry traveled from California to London over the weekend to attend the funeral of his grandfather, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. His wife, Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, remained in the United States as she is heavily pregnant with their second child.

The couple announced on Valentine's Day that they are expecting a baby girl, due in June or July. Speculation has been rife that they might name their daughter in honor of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, possibly using the name 'Lily'.

The Queen was affectionately nicknamed 'Lilibet' by her parents and husband, a name that Harry and Meghan might consider using or adapting. Social media and betting sites have been buzzing with speculation on the name choice, with some suggesting it could pay tribute to both royal grandparents.

Royal fans and bettors alike have been pondering the significance of potential names for Meghan and Harry's daughter. Betting odds from Paddy Power include options like Diana, Allegra, and Maya among others.

'Lily' is being discussed as a sweet nod to the Queen's nickname 'Lilibet' and as part of speculation on family tributes in naming. The name 'Elizabeth' is also a strong possibility, honoring the Queen directly.

Other potential names that have been suggested include 'Philippa' or 'Pippa', after Prince Philip, and 'Victoria', after Queen Victoria. The couple could also choose a more unique name, such as 'Grace' or 'Hope'.

The choice of name will ultimately be a personal one for Harry and Meghan, and it is likely to hold special meaning for them and their family. Royal watchers will be eagerly awaiting the announcement of the baby's name, which is expected in the coming weeks or months.

In the meantime, the couple is preparing for the arrival of their new daughter. Meghan is said to be doing well and is enjoying her pregnancy. Harry is reportedly excited to become a father of two and is looking forward to spending time with his growing family.

The couple's decision to name their daughter after their royal grandparents would be a touching tribute to the late Prince Philip and a nod to the Queen's enduring legacy. It would also reflect their desire to honor their family history and traditions.

Whatever name they choose, it is sure to be a meaningful and special one for Harry, Meghan, and their daughter. The arrival of their new baby will undoubtedly bring joy and happiness to their family and to the royal family as a whole.
