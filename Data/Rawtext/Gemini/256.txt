FDA Authorizes First Oral Antiviral Treatment for COVID-19

Silver Spring, MD - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets), the first oral antiviral treatment for COVID-19.

"Today's authorization introduces an important new tool to combat COVID-19," said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "This treatment provides an additional option for those at high risk of severe disease, and we expect it will save lives."

Paxlovid is authorized for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 88 pounds) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Paxlovid should be prescribed as soon as possible after a positive COVID-19 test and within five days of symptom onset.

Paxlovid is not authorized for pre-exposure or post-exposure prevention of COVID-19 or for the treatment of patients already requiring hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19. Vaccination remains the primary defense against COVID-19.

Paxlovid works by inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 protease, an enzyme that the virus needs to replicate. Ritonavir, a component of Paxlovid, prolongs the effect of nirmatrelvir by inhibiting its metabolism.

The authorization of Paxlovid was based on data from a clinical trial involving over 2,200 adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were at high risk for progression to severe disease. The trial found that Paxlovid reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 88% when taken within three days of symptom onset and by 87% when taken within five days of symptom onset.

The most common side effects of Paxlovid include impaired taste, diarrhea, high blood pressure, and muscle aches. Paxlovid is contraindicated with certain drugs due to potential serious interactions.

Under the terms of the EUA, healthcare providers are required to provide a Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers about Paxlovid to patients before prescribing the drug. Patients and caregivers are also required to receive a Fact Sheet for Patients/Caregivers about Paxlovid.

The FDA will continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of Paxlovid and will provide updates as necessary.
