House Votes to Create Independent Commission on Jan. 6 Capitol Attack

WASHINGTON, May 19 – The U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to create an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, defying Republican leadership's efforts to block the bill.

The bill, which passed 252-175, mirrors the structure of the 9/11 Commission and would establish a 10-member panel to examine the events leading up to and during the attack. The commission would have subpoena power and would be required to produce a report with recommendations to prevent future attacks.

Thirty-five Republicans voted in favor of the commission, despite opposition from House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell.

"This commission is not about politics," said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). "It's about getting to the truth of what happened on January 6th and making sure that it never happens again."

McConnell, however, dismissed the need for the commission, saying that existing Congressional investigations were sufficient.

"We do not need another commission to study this," McConnell said. "We need to get to the bottom of what happened and hold those responsible accountable."

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) suggested that the House could conduct regular committee hearings on the attack if the Senate blocks the commission.

"We will not let this attack go uninvestigated," Pelosi said. "We will get to the truth, no matter what."

The proposed commission would be modeled after the 9/11 Commission, which was created to investigate the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The 9/11 Commission's report was widely praised for its thoroughness and objectivity.

"This commission will be independent, bipartisan, and transparent," said Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.), one of the Republican co-sponsors of the bill. "We will get to the bottom of what happened on January 6th and make sure that it never happens again."

Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the commission was necessary to examine the security failures that allowed the Capitol to be breached.

"We need to know what went wrong on January 6th so that we can prevent it from happening again," Thompson said.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he would bring the bill to the Senate floor for a vote as soon as possible.

"The American people deserve to know the truth about what happened on January 6th," Schumer said. "This commission will help us get to the bottom of it."

Some Republicans, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), have expressed support for the commission, potentially with modifications.

"I believe that a commission is the best way to get to the bottom of what happened on January 6th," Collins said. "However, I would like to see some changes to the bill before I can support it."

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said he was open to considering the commission but wanted to see more details about its structure and scope.

"I want to make sure that this commission is fair and impartial," Cornyn said. "I don't want it to be a partisan witch hunt."

Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), chair of the House Administration Committee, said she was confident that the commission would be fair and impartial.

"This commission will be led by experts who are committed to getting to the truth," Lofgren said. "We will not let politics interfere with our work."

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, urged Republicans to oppose the commission, calling it a "trap" set by "the radical left."

"This commission is nothing more than a partisan witch hunt," Greene said. "It's designed to attack President Trump and his supporters."

Trump himself has urged Republicans to oppose the commission, saying that it is a "Democrat trap" that will be used to "divide the country."

"The Democrats are trying to use this commission to destroy the Republican Party," Trump said. "Don't let them do it."

Despite Trump's opposition, the bill passed the House with a significant number of Republican votes. The bill now heads to the Senate, where its fate is uncertain.
