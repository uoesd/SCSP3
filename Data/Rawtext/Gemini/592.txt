U.S.-India Partnership: A Force for Global Good

Today, I am honored to welcome Prime Minister Modi of India to the White House. This is his first trip outside South Asia in 16 months, and it underscores the importance of the U.S.-India partnership.

India is a crucial partner to the United States. We share a history of cooperation and a commitment to democracy and human rights. In June, I had the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Modi in Washington, D.C. Our discussions emphasized the interconnectedness of the world and the shared challenges we face, including COVID-19 and the climate crisis.

I want to commend India for its role in distributing vaccines early in the pandemic. India's efforts to vaccinate its population during a COVID surge were truly impressive. The United States is proud to have supported India with vaccines during this challenging time.

I am also pleased to note that India plans to resume vaccine exports. India's impressive vaccination rate of approximately 10 million people a day is a testament to the country's commitment to protecting its citizens.

The climate crisis is another significant issue that we discussed. Both the United States and India recognize the importance of our partnership in addressing environmental challenges. We are committed to working together to reduce emissions and promote clean energy.

The United States and India also share strong feelings about maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific region. We believe that all countries in the region should have the right to live in peace and security.

We also emphasized the importance of defending democratic principles and institutions against global threats to democracy. The United States and India are both committed to promoting democracy and human rights around the world.

I am eager to discuss ways to strengthen U.S.-India relations and address our mutual challenges and opportunities. I believe that our partnership is essential for the security and prosperity of both our countries and for the world.

Thank you.
