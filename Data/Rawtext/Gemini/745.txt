Tragedy on 'Rust' Set: Prop Gun Discharge Kills Crew Member, Injures Another

A tragic incident occurred on the set of the Western movie "Rust" outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Thursday, resulting in the death of a crew member and the injury of another.

According to Juan Rios, a spokesman for the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office, deputies responded to a 911 call about a person being shot on the set. Upon arrival, they found two victims: a 42-year-old woman who later died and a 42-year-old man who was receiving emergency care.

The victims were identified as Halyna Hutchins, the film's director of photography, and Joel Souza, the director.

"This is a terrible tragedy," said Rios. "We are investigating the incident and will provide more information as it becomes available."

The production of "Rust" has been halted indefinitely following the incident. The film stars Alec Baldwin, who is also a producer.

A spokesperson for Baldwin described the incident as an accident involving the misfire of a prop gun with blanks. Baldwin was reportedly seen in tears outside the sheriff's office but did not comment on the incident.

The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office is investigating the discharge of the prop firearm and the type of projectile used.

"We are working to determine what happened and who is responsible," said Rios.

The incident has raised concerns about the safety of prop guns on movie sets. In 1993, Brandon Lee was killed on the set of "The Crow" when a prop gun loaded with a live round was fired. In 1984, Jon-Erik Hexum died on the set of "Cover Up" after accidentally shooting himself with a prop gun.

"These incidents are a reminder that even prop guns can be dangerous," said Rios. "We need to take all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of everyone on set."

The movie "Rust" was scheduled to continue filming into early November. The plot centers around a 13-year-old boy who goes on the run with his grandfather (Baldwin) in 1880s Kansas.

The incident has sent shockwaves through the film industry and has raised questions about the use of prop guns on movie sets. The investigation is ongoing, and more information is expected to be released in the coming days.
