Rittenhouse Lawyer Slams Wood, Pierce for 'Monetizing' Case

Attorney Mark Richards, who represented Kyle Rittenhouse in his recent trial, has launched a scathing attack on pro-Trump lawyer Lin Wood and John Pierce, accusing them of exploiting the case for financial gain.

"They're idiots," Richards said of Wood and Pierce. "They're trying to monetize Kyle Rittenhouse."

Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all charges related to the shooting at a Kenosha, Wisconsin protest in August 2020, which resulted in the deaths of two people. Richards alleged that Wood and Pierce were attempting to use Rittenhouse's newfound fame for their own personal agendas.

"They're trying to use him for their own financial gain," Richards said. "They're trying to use him for their own political gain."

Wood responded by claiming that his fundraising efforts for Rittenhouse's bail were legal and that he had not profited from them. He also criticized Richards' remarks as baseless.

"I have never asked Kyle Rittenhouse for a dime," Wood said. "I have never received a dime from Kyle Rittenhouse."

Wood and Pierce have faced criticism for their fundraising efforts for Rittenhouse's bail, which raised over $2 million. Some have demanded that the funds be returned, arguing that they were obtained under false pretenses.

GOP Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene was among those who criticized Wood over the bail money issue. Wood responded by bizarrely calling her "a communist."

Pierce also defended his involvement, describing the controversy over the bail money as a distraction meant to discredit him.

"This is a distraction," Pierce said. "This is an attempt to discredit me."

Wood and Pierce have been involved in numerous election fraud lawsuits challenging President Joe Biden's 2020 victory. They have continued to promote conspiracy theories about the election, despite the lack of evidence to support their claims.

The jury in the Rittenhouse trial found him not guilty on all counts, including intentional and reckless homicide. During his trial, Rittenhouse argued that he acted in self-defense during the protest.

Richards said that he was "very happy" with the verdict and that he believed it was a "just result."

"I think the jury got it right," Richards said. "I think they saw through the lies and the propaganda."

Wood and Pierce have not yet commented on the verdict.
