Royals Go Green: Harry and Meghan Pledge Net Zero Carbon Emissions

In a groundbreaking move within the royal family, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2030, setting an ambitious environmental goal for themselves and their Archewell Foundation.

The announcement, made on their Archewell website, coincided with the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, where world leaders gathered to address the urgent issue of climate change.

"We believe that a more sustainable future is possible, and we are committed to doing our part," the Sussexes stated in their announcement. "We are all interconnected, and as a global community, we must work together to protect our planet and future generations."

Archewell's commitment to net zero carbon emissions builds upon previous efforts by the organization to offset and balance its carbon footprint. Now, with the help of partner organizations, Archewell aims to achieve net zero by reducing its carbon footprint through thoughtful daily choices and investing in carbon removal projects.

"Net zero" refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gases produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere. To achieve this, individuals and organizations must reduce their carbon footprint through measures such as using renewable energy, reducing waste, and adopting sustainable practices.

The Sussexes' commitment includes rethinking their travel and daily activities to minimize carbon emissions. They will also invest in carbon removal projects that capture and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

"We are working with partners who are experts in their fields to help us achieve our goals," the Sussexes said. "We believe that by working together, we can create a more sustainable future for all."

Among Archewell's partners are Travalyst and Ethic. Travalyst, a non-profit organization co-founded by Prince Harry, focuses on sustainable travel practices. Ethic, a financial services company, helps investors align their portfolios with their environmental values.

Since stepping back from their royal duties in 2020, Harry and Meghan have become more vocal in their political and environmental advocacy. Meghan recently penned an open letter advocating for nationalized paid parental leave in the United States.

The Sussexes' environmental push aligns with similar efforts by other members of the royal family. Prince William, Kate Middleton, and Prince Charles have all attended COP26 and highlighted the importance of addressing climate change.

At COP26, Prince William introduced the finalists of the Earthshot Prize Awards, an initiative he launched to recognize and support innovators working to repair the planet. The awards focus on five key areas: protecting and restoring nature, cleaning the air, reviving the oceans, building a waste-free world, and fixing the climate.

The royal family's commitment to environmental sustainability sends a powerful message about the urgency of addressing climate change. By pledging to achieve net zero carbon emissions, Harry and Meghan are setting an example for others to follow and demonstrating that even the most privileged members of society have a responsibility to protect the planet.
