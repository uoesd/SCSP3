Tragedy on I-75: 2-Year-Old Boy Killed in Freeway Shooting

Detroit, MI - A senseless act of violence has shattered the lives of a Detroit family, leaving them grappling with the unimaginable loss of their beloved 2-year-old son.

On Thursday evening, Brian Christian and his family were returning home from basketball practice when their vehicle was struck by gunfire on Interstate 75. Their youngest child, Brison, was fatally wounded, while his 9-year-old brother, Brian Jr., sustained a graze wound.

"It's like a nightmare that I can't wake up from," said Brian Christian, Brison's father. "He was just a baby. He didn't deserve this."

The Christians had meticulously planned for Brison's arrival, ensuring a stable home, marriage, and secure jobs. Brison's birth brought immense joy to the family, and his unique personality and development left an unforgettable mark on their hearts.

"He was always smiling and laughing," Brian recalled. "He loved to play with his brothers and sisters. He was just starting to talk and say new words."

Michigan State Police have made multiple arrests in connection with the shooting and have recovered the suspect vehicle. The Detroit Board of Police Commissioners condemned the incident as a tragic example of the senseless violence plaguing the community.

"This is a senseless act of violence that has no place in our city," said Interim Detroit Police Chief James White. "We will work tirelessly to bring those responsible to justice."

White added that DPD's homicide section would assist Michigan State Police in their investigation.

Brian, who works for Comcast, had recently been able to spend more time with Brison due to a change in his work schedule. He cherished the extra moments he had with his son and was heartbroken by his untimely demise.

"I want Brison to become the face of freeway shootings advocacy," Brian said. "I want to put billboards of him up along state freeways so that people will remember what happened to him and demand change."

The Christian family is organizing a balloon release for Brison and making funeral arrangements. A GoFundMe campaign has been launched to support the family during this difficult time.

"We are devastated by the loss of our precious Brison," said Tempestt Christian, Brison's mother. "He was our everything, and we will never forget him."

The shooting has sent shockwaves through the community, highlighting the urgent need for action to address gun violence. The Christians hope that Brison's memory will serve as a catalyst for change and prevent other families from experiencing the same unimaginable pain.

"We don't want any other family to go through what we're going through," Brian said. "We want Brison's legacy to be one of peace and justice."
