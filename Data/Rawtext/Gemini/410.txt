Chauvin Seeks New Trial, Citing Jury Misconduct and Trial Errors

Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has filed a motion for a new trial in the death of George Floyd, arguing that the trial was tainted by jury and prosecutorial misconduct, and that the verdict was contrary to law.

Chauvin's attorney, William Mohrman, filed the motion on Friday, outlining several alleged errors that he claims deprived Chauvin of a fair trial.

"The cumulative effect of these errors was to deprive Mr. Chauvin of his right to a fair trial and to a verdict based on the evidence presented at trial," Mohrman wrote in the motion.

One of the main arguments in the motion is that the jury was not adequately shielded from extensive publicity surrounding the case, which Mohrman claims prejudiced the jurors against Chauvin.

"The jury was exposed to a barrage of prejudicial publicity that made it impossible for them to be impartial," Mohrman wrote.

The motion also mentions a controversy surrounding juror Brandon Mitchell, who attended a march wearing a shirt that referenced police brutality. Mitchell has since stated that the march was attended to support voter turnout, not protests against police brutality.

Chauvin's motion demands a hearing to investigate alleged jury misconduct and pressure during deliberations.

Legal experts believe that Chauvin's chances of getting a new trial are slim.

"It's very difficult to overturn a jury verdict," said Rachel Moran, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas. "The court would have to find that there was a clear and prejudicial error that affected the outcome of the trial."

The original jury consisted of a diverse mix of six White, four Black, and two multiracial individuals.

Chauvin was convicted in April of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. He faces a possible maximum sentence of 40 years in prison.

Prosecutors have introduced "aggravating factors" that could increase Chauvin's sentence, including the fact that Floyd was particularly vulnerable and that Chauvin abused his position of authority.

Chauvin's sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 25.
