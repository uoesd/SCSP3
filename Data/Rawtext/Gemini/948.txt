Toomey Faces GOP Censure Over Trump Impeachment Vote

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) – U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania is facing the wrath of state Republican Party committee members over his vote to convict Donald Trump during the former president's second impeachment trial.

A censure vote against Toomey is being considered, although it would be largely symbolic since Toomey is not seeking reelection.

Toomey has called for Republicans to be tolerant of differing opinions regarding Trump's role in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.

"We have to be a big tent party," Toomey said. "We have to be tolerant of different views."

Toomey was one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump of "incitement of insurrection."

State GOP Chair Lawrence Tabas said he is planning a meeting to discuss a potential censure resolution against Toomey.

"We have to stand up for our values," Tabas said. "We can't let people get away with attacking our president."

Toomey supporters are pushing back against the censure, arguing that a "Trump litmus test" for loyalty is divisive and damaging.

"This is not the Republican Party I grew up with," said Jezree Friend, a state committee member from Erie County. "We used to be a party of ideas, not a cult of personality."

Sam DeMarco, chair of the Allegheny County Republican Party, said he believes the censure vote is a mistake.

"It's going to further divide the party," DeMarco said. "We need to be focused on winning elections, not on punishing people who disagree with us."

Dom Giordano, a conservative radio host on WPHT-AM, said he believes Toomey's vote was a betrayal of his constituents.

"He turned his back on the people who elected him," Giordano said. "He should be ashamed of himself."

Toomey has argued that he could not turn a blind eye when a president attempts illegal and unconstitutional means of staying in power.

"The fact pattern," Toomey said, "I think is pretty damning."

Once a champion for conservative challenges within the GOP, Toomey has become criticized by Trump loyalists for his objections to Trump's conduct.

Despite backing many of Trump's policies, Toomey's reluctance to closely align with Trump has made him a target within his party.

"He's always been a maverick," said a Republican strategist who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But this time, he's gone too far."

The censure vote is expected to be taken at the state Republican Party's next meeting in March. If passed, it would be the first time a sitting U.S. senator has been censured by his own state party since the Civil War.

Toomey has said he is not concerned about the potential censure.

"I'm not going to change my principles just to please a few people," Toomey said. "I'm going to do what I believe is right."

The censure vote is the latest sign of the deep divisions within the Republican Party over Trump. The party is struggling to find a way to move forward after Trump's presidency, and the censure vote is likely to further exacerbate those divisions.
