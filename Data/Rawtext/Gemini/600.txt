Vice President Harris: A Bold Commitment to Eradicate Lead Hazards and Empower American Workers

Today, I stand before you with a profound sense of urgency and unwavering determination to address two critical issues that have plagued our communities for far too long: the insidious threat of lead exposure and the need to revitalize our nation's infrastructure.

Lead, a toxic substance, has no place in our homes, schools, or workplaces. Yet, millions of Americans, particularly in underserved communities, continue to face the devastating consequences of lead poisoning. Children are especially vulnerable to the harmful effects of lead, which can impair their cognitive development, damage their nervous systems, and lead to a lifetime of health challenges.

The Biden-Harris administration is committed to confronting this crisis head-on. We recognize the leadership and accountability called for by communities across the nation, and we stand in solidarity with their demands for a swift and comprehensive response.

That is why we have launched the Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan, an ambitious initiative that aims to accelerate the removal of lead pipes and paint over the next decade. This plan will prioritize underserved communities, ensuring that every American has access to clean and safe drinking water.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, a landmark achievement supported by leaders from both sides of the aisle, allocates a historic $15 billion for replacing lead service lines nationwide. This investment will not only protect public health but also create thousands of good-paying jobs.

In 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will distribute $2.9 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to states, tribes, and territories for lead service line replacement. This funding will jumpstart critical infrastructure projects, ensuring that communities across the country can access clean water.

Additionally, funds from the American Rescue Plan can also be used for lead service line replacement. Cities like Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Syracuse, and Duluth are already utilizing these funds to replace lead pipes and upgrade their water infrastructure.

These infrastructure projects will not only improve public health but also create much-needed jobs, including good union jobs. The Biden-Harris administration is committed to being pro-labor, and we believe that American workers should have the opportunity to earn a fair wage and support their families.

Replacing lead service lines and upgrading our water infrastructure requires skilled labor. That is why we are investing in training programs to ensure that workers have the necessary skills to succeed in these jobs.

My recent visit to Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 189 in Columbus, Ohio, was a testament to the enthusiasm and skill development that is taking place in anticipation of the job opportunities created by these infrastructure projects. The apprentices I met were eager to learn and excited about the prospect of contributing to the health and well-being of their communities.

The Biden-Harris administration is committed to working with Congress, state and local governments, labor unions, and community organizations to ensure that the Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan is implemented swiftly and effectively. We will continue to listen to the concerns of communities and work tirelessly to address the challenges they face.

Together, we can create a future where every American has access to clean water, where our children are protected from the dangers of lead exposure, and where our workers have the opportunity to succeed.

Let us embrace this challenge with the same determination and resolve that has guided our nation through countless trials. Let us build a better, healthier, and more prosperous future for all Americans.
