Jensen Ackles' Gun Training Comments Resurface Amid 'Rust' Tragedy

Days before a fatal on-set shooting on the set of the Western film "Rust," actor Jensen Ackles discussed his firearm training for the movie at a fan event. A clip from Ackles' talk, which has since been deleted from many online platforms, has reignited attention on the circumstances surrounding the tragic accident.

In the video, Ackles described a brief training session with the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, focusing on how to load and fire a prop gun. "She basically gave us a quick rundown of how to load it, how to fire it, how to clear it," Ackles said.

The fatal on-set accident occurred on October 21, 2021, when actor Alec Baldwin discharged a prop gun that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza. There is no evidence suggesting that Jensen Ackles was involved in the scene of the shooting.

Baldwin expressed his shock and sadness over the accident on Twitter, stating, "There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours." He added that he is fully cooperating with the investigation.

The Santa Fe County sheriff's office is investigating the type of projectile discharged and how it ended up in the prop gun. A spokesman for the sheriff's office said, "We are investigating how and what type of projectile was loaded into the firearm."

Reports emerged that Baldwin was surprised upon allegedly being given a "hot gun," meaning a gun loaded with live ammunition, not having experienced this before on set.

Ackles has not yet publicly commented on the accident or on his previously recorded gun training comments.

The "Rust" shooting has raised concerns about safety protocols on film sets and the use of prop guns. The incident has also sparked a debate about the responsibility of actors and crew members in ensuring the safety of their colleagues.

The investigation into the "Rust" shooting is ongoing, and more details are expected to emerge in the coming weeks.
