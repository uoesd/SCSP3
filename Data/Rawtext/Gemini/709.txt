Michigan Middle School Staff Member Arrested for School Threat

ST. CLAIR SHORES, Mich. – A Michigan middle school staff member was arrested on Friday for allegedly leaving threatening notes, including one that threatened the school.

The staff member, who remains unnamed pending charges, was caught on security camera footage leaving the notes, according to Lakeview Public Schools Superintendent Karl Paulson.

"This is a very serious matter, and we are taking it very seriously," Paulson said in a letter to families. "The safety of our students and staff is our top priority."

One of the notes appeared to be a false threat aimed at closing the school, Paulson said. No lockdowns or safety protocols were initiated.

The incident comes amid a history of school threats in Michigan, including the deadly shooting at Oxford High School last year. Recent nationwide school closures were also prompted by anonymous shooting and bomb threats on TikTok.

"We are extremely disappointed in the actions of this staff member," Paulson said. "This type of behavior is unacceptable and will not be tolerated."

The school district is cooperating with police in the ongoing investigation. Macomb County Prosecutor Peter Lucido said there is enough evidence to charge the staff member with several crimes.

"We are still investigating the motive behind these threats," Lucido said. "But it is clear that this incident has had a negative impact on the school community."

Lucido emphasized the importance of school safety, especially in light of recent events.

"We need to do everything we can to ensure that our schools are safe places for our children to learn and grow," he said. "Threats like these are unacceptable and will not be tolerated."

The staff member is expected to be arraigned on Monday.
