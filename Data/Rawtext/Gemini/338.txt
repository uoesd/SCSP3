Ever Given Crew Emerges After Suez Canal Blockade Ordeal

Cairo, Egypt - For the first time since the Ever Given cargo ship became wedged in the Suez Canal, blocking global trade for six days, Captain Krishnan Kanthavel and his crew have been photographed.

The incident, which occurred in March 2021, caused significant disruption to global trade, with an estimated cost of £7 billion per day. Over 400 ships were held up due to the blockage, resulting in delays and increased costs for businesses worldwide.

After intense salvage operations, the Ever Given was finally dislodged and towed to the Great Bitter Lake, where it remained for four months while a $1 billion compensation deal was negotiated between its owners and the Suez Canal Authority.

The blockage also led to Egypt losing $15 million in transit fees each day, highlighting the canal's critical role in global trade.

Captain Kanthavel expressed his gratitude for the support and professionalism of his crew during the ordeal: "I am proud of my team. They worked tirelessly and remained calm under immense pressure."

Abdulgani Serang, General Secretary of the National Union of Seafarers of India, praised the crew's efforts: "They faced an unprecedented situation with courage and determination. Their actions prevented a potentially catastrophic outcome."

Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd, the owner of the Ever Given, acknowledged the crew's hard work and professionalism: "We are grateful for their dedication and resilience during this challenging time."

Investigations into the incident are ongoing, with no official outcome announced yet. However, Egypt has announced plans to widen and deepen the canal section where the Ever Given became stuck and upgrade its rescue fleet to prevent similar incidents in the future.

The Ever Given is currently carrying goods worth over £650 million, some of which may have perished during the ordeal, including food items. The ship's cargo is now being inspected and assessed for damage.

The incident has highlighted the importance of the Suez Canal as a vital artery for global trade and the need for continuous efforts to ensure its smooth operation. The Ever Given crew's professionalism and resilience have also been widely recognized, underscoring the critical role seafarers play in maintaining global supply chains.
