Expert Testifies Rittenhouse's Shooting Justified

KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) – A use-of-force expert testified at a pretrial hearing that Kyle Rittenhouse's decisions to shoot three people during a Wisconsin protest were justified because they had attacked him and tried to take his gun.

John Black, a former law enforcement officer and use-of-force instructor, outlined his findings during a hearing on Tuesday. His testimony offers a preview of the defense strategy for Rittenhouse's trial, which is set to begin next month.

Rittenhouse, 17 at the time, went to Kenosha in August 2020 in response to a militia's call to protect businesses during protests sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake. He is charged with multiple counts, including homicide and being a minor in possession of a firearm.

Black testified that Rittenhouse was justified in shooting Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber, and Gaige Grosskreutz because they had either attacked him or threatened to do so.

"Mr. Rittenhouse was being chased by Mr. Rosenbaum, who had threatened to kill him," Black said. "Mr. Huber struck Mr. Rittenhouse with a skateboard, and Mr. Grosskreutz pointed a gun at him."

Black's testimony was challenged by prosecutors, who questioned his expertise on civilian use of force and argued that Rittenhouse was not justified in using lethal force without first trying to retreat.

"Mr. Rittenhouse was not in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm when he shot Mr. Rosenbaum," said Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger. "He could have retreated, but he chose to shoot instead."

Defense attorney Mark Richards said he plans to call Black as a witness at the trial, subject to Judge Bruce Schroeder's approval.

"Mr. Black's testimony is crucial to our defense," Richards said. "It shows that Kyle Rittenhouse acted in self-defense and that his use of force was justified."

Schroeder denied a defense request to drop the weapons possession charge against Rittenhouse, citing unclear statutes. He also denied the prosecution's request to prevent media from broadcasting or publishing images of witnesses' faces.

Rittenhouse has become a polarizing figure, drawing support from conservatives as a patriot and criticism from liberals and activists as a domestic terrorist. His trial is expected to be closely watched and could have implications for the debate over gun rights and self-defense.
