Rittenhouse Acquittal Sparks Debate on Guns, Vigilantism, and Racial Injustice

KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) – Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges Friday in the Kenosha shootings, a verdict that has sparked a national debate over guns, vigilantism, and racial injustice in the United States.

Rittenhouse, 18, testified during the trial that he acted in self-defense when he shot and killed two men and wounded a third during protests in Kenosha in August 2020. The protests erupted after a white police officer shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, in the back seven times, leaving him paralyzed.

The case has divided public opinion, with some viewing Rittenhouse as a patriot who defended himself from rioters and others condemning him as a vigilante who provoked the violence.

Rittenhouse was charged with homicide, attempted homicide, and reckless endangering for killing Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, 27.

"I'm just glad that the truth prevailed," Rittenhouse said after the verdict. "I'm glad that I can go home and be with my family."

Rittenhouse's defense attorney, Mark Richards, said the verdict was a "victory for the Second Amendment" and for "the right to self-defense."

"Kyle Rittenhouse is not guilty of any crime," Richards said. "He acted in self-defense and he saved his own life."

Prosecutors portrayed Rittenhouse as a "wannabe soldier" who provoked the violence by bringing an AR-15-style rifle to the protests.

"He came to Kenosha looking for trouble," said Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley. "He found it, and he created it."

The trial and verdict come amid other high-profile trials that have reflected racial divisions in the United States, including the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murdering George Floyd.

"This verdict is a miscarriage of justice," said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a civil rights leader. "It sends a message that white vigilantes can kill Black people with impunity."

President Joe Biden said he was "deeply concerned" about the verdict.

"We must not become a country where armed vigilantes with military-style weapons decide who lives and who dies," Biden said.

Former President Donald Trump praised the verdict, calling it a "great victory for the Second Amendment."

"Kyle Rittenhouse is a hero," Trump said.

Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, a Democrat, said the verdict was "a slap in the face to the victims and their families."

"This verdict is a reminder that our justice system is broken," Barnes said.

Mark McCloskey, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Missouri, said the verdict was "a victory for law-abiding citizens."

"Kyle Rittenhouse is a hero who defended himself from a violent mob," McCloskey said.

Corey Chirafisi, another of Rittenhouse's defense attorneys, said the verdict was "a vindication of the Second Amendment."

"Kyle Rittenhouse had the right to defend himself," Chirafisi said.

Prosecutor Thomas Binger said he was "disappointed" by the verdict but respected the jury's decision.

"We believe that the evidence showed that Kyle Rittenhouse was not acting in self-defense," Binger said.

Gaige Grosskreutz, who was shot in the arm by Rittenhouse, said he was "disgusted" by the verdict.

"This verdict sends a message that it's okay to kill people in the streets," Grosskreutz said.

Legal experts suggested that the defense may have had an advantage due to Wisconsin's self-defense laws, which are among the most permissive in the country.

"Wisconsin's self-defense law is very broad," said John Gross, a criminal defense attorney in Milwaukee. "It allows people to use deadly force if they reasonably believe that they are in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm."

The jury deliberated for four days before reaching a verdict. The verdict was met with cheers from Rittenhouse's supporters and protests from his detractors.

The verdict is likely to be appealed, and it could have a significant impact on the debate over gun rights and vigilantism in the United States.
