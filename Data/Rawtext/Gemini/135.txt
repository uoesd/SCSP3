CNN Parts Ways with Rick Santorum After Controversial Native American Remarks

CNN — – Former US senator and conservative commentator Rick Santorum is no longer with CNN following his controversial remarks about Native Americans.

Santorum, in an April speech to a conservative youth group, stated that the US was "birthed from nothing" and minimized the contribution of Native American culture to American culture. His comments sparked significant backlash, including criticism from the Native American Journalists Association and calls for his firing.

Santorum defended himself on "Cuomo Prime Time," saying he misspoke and acknowledging the mistreatment of Native Americans but did not apologize for his initial remarks. CNN's decision to part ways with Santorum followed dissatisfaction within the network regarding his defense of the comments.

A CNN spokesperson confirmed Santorum's departure but did not provide further details. Santorum's remarks and subsequent defense led to him being "benched" as none of the anchors wanted to book him.

This is not the first time a commentator has left CNN amid controversy, with Jeffery Lord and Paris Dennard being notable past cases. Santorum was known for being an outspoken supporter of the Trump agenda on CNN.

Santorum did not immediately respond to requests for comment on his departure from CNN.

Santorum's Controversial Remarks

In his speech to the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit, Santorum said, "We birthed a nation from nothing. I mean, there was nothing here. I mean, yes, we have Native Americans, but candidly, there isn't much Native American culture in American culture."

His comments were widely condemned by Native American groups and historians, who pointed out the rich and diverse contributions of Native American culture to American society, including language, art, music, and cuisine.

Backlash and Calls for Firing

Santorum's remarks sparked immediate backlash on social media and from Native American organizations. The Native American Journalists Association called for CNN to fire Santorum, saying his comments were "harmful and offensive."

Several CNN anchors also criticized Santorum's remarks, including Don Lemon, who said they were "deeply offensive" and "not based in fact."

Santorum's Defense

Santorum defended his remarks on "Cuomo Prime Time," saying he misspoke and acknowledging the mistreatment of Native Americans. However, he did not apologize for his initial comments.

Santorum said he was trying to make the point that the US was founded on Judeo-Christian principles, not Native American culture. He also said that he believes Native Americans have been "treated terribly" and that he supports their rights.

CNN's Decision

CNN's decision to part ways with Santorum followed dissatisfaction within the network regarding his defense of his comments. A CNN spokesperson said the network "does not tolerate commentary that denigrates entire population groups."

Santorum's departure from CNN is a reminder of the challenges that news organizations face in balancing free speech with the need to be inclusive and respectful of all communities.
