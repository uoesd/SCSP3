Golden State Stimulus Expansion Proposed, Targeting California's Middle Class

California is set to expand its Golden State Stimulus program, providing $600 payments to millions of low-income households and proposing to extend eligibility to the state's middle class.

Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed tripling the investment in the program to $11.9 billion, allowing taxpayers earning up to $75,000 in adjusted gross income to qualify for the stimulus check. Families with dependents and those with undocumented workers filing taxes could receive additional funds.

The initiative aims to benefit 78% of California taxpayers, covering two in three Californians. Those who received the first round of payments are generally not eligible for the second, with certain exceptions for taxpayers with dependents.

The plan requires legislative approval by June 15, with hopes to distribute payments quickly thereafter. The first round targeted low-income taxpayers, families with children in CalWORKS, and recipients of certain state benefits.

Undocumented tax filers were eligible for the first round if they met income criteria, with certain adjustments for those making less than $30,000. As of early May, the state's tax agency distributed 2.5 million payments worth $1.6 billion from the first round, with more payments pending.

Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for the expanded Golden State Stimulus, taxpayers must meet the following criteria:

  • California resident
  • Filed a 2020 tax return by May 17, 2021
  • Adjusted gross income (AGI) of $75,000 or less
  • Not claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return

Additional Benefits

Families with dependents could receive an additional $500 per child, up to a maximum of $1,000 per family. Undocumented workers who filed taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) could also receive additional funds, with specific eligibility criteria to be determined.

Economic Impact

The Golden State Stimulus program is expected to provide a significant boost to California's economy. The first round of payments is estimated to have injected $1.6 billion into the state's economy, supporting local businesses and stimulating consumer spending.

The expanded program is expected to have an even greater impact, with an estimated $11.9 billion in payments reaching California households. This influx of funds is likely to boost economic activity, create jobs, and help families recover from the financial hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Legislative Approval

The Golden State Stimulus expansion proposal requires legislative approval by June 15. The California Legislature is currently considering the proposal, and a vote is expected in the coming weeks.

If approved, the state's tax agency will begin distributing payments as soon as possible. The first payments could be sent out as early as July, with the majority of payments expected to be distributed by the end of the summer.

Conclusion

The Golden State Stimulus program is a significant effort to provide financial relief to California households during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed expansion of the program would extend eligibility to the state's middle class, providing much-needed support to families and individuals who have been impacted by the economic downturn.

The program is expected to have a positive impact on California's economy, stimulating consumer spending and supporting local businesses. The Legislature's approval of the expansion proposal is crucial to ensuring that these benefits reach California households as quickly as possible.
