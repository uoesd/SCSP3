ECB Joins Global Central Banks in Tapering Asset Purchases

Frankfurt, Germany - The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced its decision to begin tapering its asset purchases, joining a growing number of major global central banks that are reducing or ending their quantitative easing (QE) programs.

The ECB's asset purchase rate has been significantly higher than that of the Federal Reserve, averaging around $181 billion per month. However, the central bank emphasized that its decision to reduce asset purchases is a "recalibration" rather than tapering, echoing similar stances taken by other central banks.

"We are not tapering in the sense of the Fed," ECB President Christine Lagarde said at a press conference. "We are recalibrating our pace of purchases."

The ECB's Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) will see a "moderately lower" pace of net asset purchases, continuing at least until March 2022. The balance level will be maintained at least until the end of 2023.

Other ECB programs, such as the Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO III) and the Asset Purchase Program (APP), will continue as planned.

The ECB's total asset balance has reached approximately €8.2 trillion, with a major portion in bonds and loans to banks.

Central Banks Globally Agree on QE Exit

Central banks around the world agree that QE programs need to end before interest rates can be hiked to avoid disrupting the yield curve.

"We are all in the same boat," Lagarde said. "We all need to exit from QE."

The Federal Reserve is still expanding its balance sheet by $120 billion a month, despite consensus among economists that it should start tapering this year.

ECB Navigates QE Exit

ECB President Lagarde affirmed the unanimous decision to recalibrate asset purchases amidst efforts to navigate exiting QE without destabilizing the Eurozone.

"We are confident that we can manage this transition smoothly," Lagarde said. "We are committed to maintaining favorable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy."

Other Central Banks Tapering or Ending QE

The Bank of Japan, Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Reserve Bank of New Zealand, and Reserve Bank of Australia have already started tapering or ending their QE programs.

Impact on Markets

The ECB's decision to recalibrate asset purchases was largely expected by markets, and had a limited impact on bond yields and stock prices.

Conclusion

The ECB's decision to join other major central banks in tapering asset purchases marks a significant step towards normalizing monetary policy after years of extraordinary measures. The central bank's emphasis on a gradual and cautious approach aims to minimize market disruptions and support the Eurozone's economic recovery.
