Brees' Return: A Missed Opportunity for Saints' Dynasty with Brady

Drew Brees' decision to return for the 2020 season with the New Orleans Saints was driven by his desire to capture a second Super Bowl title. However, the season proved to be a challenging one for the veteran quarterback, as he battled multiple injuries that impacted his performance.

As Brees struggled, speculation began to swirl about what could have happened had he retired a season earlier. ESPN reporter Jeff Darlington revealed on "Get Up" that Tom Brady was very close to signing with the Saints before ultimately joining the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

"Tom Brady was very close to signing with the Saints," Darlington said. "He had a lot of interest in the Saints. He was very close to making that move."

Brady's interest in the Saints was significant, and his decision was heavily influenced by Brees' decision to continue playing. Had Brees retired, it's likely that Brady would have joined the Saints, bringing with him key players such as Rob Gronkowski, Antonio Brown, and Leonard Fournette.

Brady's health and performance metrics during the season were significantly better than Brees', raising questions about what could have been possible for the Saints. Brady led the Buccaneers to a Super Bowl victory, while Brees and the Saints struggled to make the playoffs.

The hypothetical scenario of the Saints' success with Brady remains an unanswered question. However, it's clear that Brees' decision to return had a significant impact on the team's trajectory.

With Brees now retired, the Saints have turned to former Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston as their solution. Winston has shown flashes of brilliance but also struggles with consistency. It remains to be seen whether he can lead the Saints back to the Super Bowl.

For now, the Saints' fans are left to wonder what could have been if Brady had joined the team. It's a tantalizing thought that will likely haunt the franchise for years to come.
