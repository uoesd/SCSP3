Deadly Pileup on Icy Texas Interstate Kills Five

Fort Worth, Texas – A massive crash involving dozens of vehicles on an icy Texas interstate has left at least five people dead and an unknown number injured.

The accident occurred on Interstate 35 near downtown Fort Worth on Thursday morning, amid a winter storm affecting a large section of the U.S. The exact number of injured from the crash remained unknown as police continued their efforts at the scene.

"It's a very chaotic scene," said Fort Worth Police Chief Neil Noakes. "We have multiple vehicles involved, and we're still trying to determine the extent of the injuries."

A reunification center for family members has been set up at a community center following the event. The Fort Worth Police advised individuals involved in minor accidents to exchange information and move on.

"If you're involved in a minor accident, please pull over to the side of the road, exchange information, and then get out of the way so that emergency responders can get through," Noakes said.

Several other crashes were reported in the area due to the icy conditions. At least eight people have died in the metroplex area, including incidents in Dallas and Arlington.

In Austin, a pileup involving more than two dozen vehicles occurred on an icy road, injuring one person.

The winter storm has also caused widespread power outages, with more than 125,000 homes and businesses without electricity, mostly in Kentucky and West Virginia.

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency, urging people to stay home due to icy conditions.

"We're asking everyone to stay off the roads if at all possible," Beshear said. "The roads are very dangerous, and we don't want to see any more tragedies."

The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for much of the central and eastern U.S., with heavy snow and ice expected in some areas.

Travelers are advised to check road conditions before heading out and to be prepared for delays.
