Santa Clara University President on Leave Amid Investigation

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) – Rev. Kevin O'Brien, who presided over President Joe Biden's inaugural Mass, is on leave from his position as president of Santa Clara University amid an investigation into unspecified allegations.

John M. Sobrato, the board chairman, announced the investigation and O'Brien's leave in a statement on Monday. "The allegations involve behaviors in adult settings, consisting primarily of conversations, that may violate Jesuit protocols," Sobrato said.

The nature of the allegations against O'Brien has not been specified publicly. Tracey Primrose, spokeswoman for the Jesuits West Province overseeing the investigation, emphasized the Jesuits' adherence to a professional code of conduct. "We take all allegations seriously and are committed to a thorough and fair investigation," Primrose said.

O'Brien, who joined the Society of Jesus in 1996 and was ordained in 2006, has a long history with Biden. He has known the family for about 15 years and presided over services for Biden's vice president inaugurations.

Santa Clara University, where O'Brien served as president since 2019, is a top-ranked Jesuit institution with about 5,500 undergraduate students.

O'Brien and the Jesuits West Province have not made public comments regarding the investigation.

The investigation comes at a time when the Catholic Church is facing increased scrutiny over allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct by clergy. In recent years, several high-profile church leaders have been accused of sexual misconduct, leading to calls for greater accountability and transparency within the church.

The allegations against O'Brien are not related to sexual abuse. However, they raise questions about the church's handling of misconduct by clergy and its commitment to ethical behavior.

The investigation is expected to take several weeks or months to complete. In the meantime, O'Brien will remain on leave from his position as president of Santa Clara University.
