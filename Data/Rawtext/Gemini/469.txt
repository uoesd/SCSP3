Lilibet's Christening Plans Remain Unconfirmed Amidst Royal Speculation

The christening of Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, the daughter of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, remains unconfirmed, with speculation swirling about the location and timing of the event.

Named after Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Diana, Lilibet's birth was announced with joy by her parents in June 2021. Her nickname, Lili, honors Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, who called Meghan 'Flower' as a child.

Initially, there were desires for Lilibet's christening to be held at St. George's Chapel in Windsor, where her brother Archie was christened in 2019. However, according to NBC royals correspondent Neil Sean, Prince William allegedly denied the request, citing it wasn't a good idea.

"Apparently, William said it's not a good idea," Sean said. "He said, 'Look, we are not doing that. We are not having another member of the royal family christened at Windsor.'"

A representative for Harry and Meghan dismissed claims about the christening plans as speculation. "There are no confirmed plans for Lilibet's christening at this time," the spokesperson said.

There has been consideration for a christening in California, where Harry and Meghan currently reside. Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams suggested that the couple may opt for a private ceremony in the United States.

"I think it's very likely that they will have a christening in California," Fitzwilliams said. "It's their home, and they're very happy there."

The date of Lilibet's christening remains unconfirmed. Archie, her brother, was christened at two months old, while Prince William's children had their christenings between two and three months old.

For more insights into Harry and Meghan's life, Fitzwilliams recommends reading 'Finding Freedom,' a biography written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand.

"It's a very well-written book," Fitzwilliams said. "It gives a very good insight into their relationship and their decision to step back from royal duties."

The christening of Lilibet is a highly anticipated event, and it will be interesting to see where and when it takes place. Whether it's in Windsor, California, or elsewhere, it's sure to be a special occasion for the royal family.
