Biden's Inauguration: Fact vs. Fiction

The inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, 2021, was a momentous event witnessed by millions around the world. However, in the aftermath of the inauguration, a barrage of unfounded claims and conspiracy theories emerged, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the event and Biden's presidency. This article aims to debunk these claims and provide a factual account of the inauguration.

Witnesses and Media Coverage

The inauguration ceremony was attended by numerous individuals, including former presidents, members of Congress, and foreign dignitaries. The event was broadcast live by major news outlets such as ABC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, NBC, and PBS, providing ample evidence of its occurrence.

Claims of a Fake Inauguration

Despite the overwhelming evidence, some individuals have asserted that the inauguration was staged or that Biden is not the real president. These claims lack any credible basis and are contradicted by the eyewitness accounts and media coverage.

Conspiracy Theory: Lack of Disruptions

One conspiracy theory suggests that the inauguration was fake because there were no major disruptions or protests. However, this is a flawed argument. Inaugurations typically involve heightened security measures to prevent disruptions, and the absence of such incidents does not indicate a staged event.

Social Media Flagging

Social media platforms such as Facebook have flagged posts spreading the conspiracy theory about a fake inauguration as part of their efforts to combat false news. These platforms have a responsibility to prevent the spread of misinformation and protect the integrity of their platforms.

White House Inauguration Video

The White House released an official video of the inauguration on its YouTube channel. Despite receiving more dislikes than likes, the video remains available and provides further evidence of the event's authenticity.

Executive Orders

Claims that Biden's executive orders are not available online are false. The executive orders are published on the Office of the Federal Register website, which is the official source for federal regulations and documents.

Biden's Granddaughters

Some conspiracy theorists have claimed that Biden's granddaughters disappeared and reappeared during the inauguration coverage. However, this is not true. The granddaughters were present throughout the event, and their appearances were captured from different camera angles.

Private Plane to Washington D.C.

Biden broke with tradition by using a private plane to travel to Washington D.C. for the inauguration. This decision was made due to security concerns, as the outgoing administration had not provided a government plane.

Oval Office Appearances

Allegations that Biden's Oval Office appearances are on a movie set have been debunked. Biden has been seen multiple times in the White House, and his appearances have been consistent with the layout and décor of the Oval Office.

Conclusion

The conspiracy theory claiming that Biden's presidency is illegitimate is rated 'Pants on Fire!' indicating falsehood. The inauguration was a real event witnessed by numerous individuals and broadcast live by major media outlets. The claims of a fake inauguration lack evidence and are contradicted by the facts. Biden is the duly elected President of the United States, and his presidency is legitimate.
