Parents Divided on Vaccinating Young Children Against COVID-19

A new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) finds that parents of children ages 12-17 are divided on whether to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, with 48% reporting that their child has received at least one dose of a vaccine and 34% saying they will vaccinate their child "right away" once a vaccine is authorized for children ages 5-11.

The survey also finds that a majority of parents (58%) believe K-12 schools should require all students and staff to wear masks, and 69% of parents with a child attending in-person school say their school is requiring masks for all students and staff.

However, there is some concern among parents about the potential for their child to get seriously sick from COVID-19, with 57% of parents expressing this concern. This concern is higher among Hispanic and lower-income parents.

Parents Divided on Vaccinating Young Children

The survey finds that parents are divided on whether to vaccinate their children against COVID-19.

However, there is a significant minority of parents who are hesitant to vaccinate their children. Among parents of children ages 5-11, 32% say they will "wait and see" before getting their child vaccinated, and 24% say they definitely will not vaccinate their child.

Concerns About Vaccine Safety

One of the main reasons parents are hesitant to vaccinate their children is concerns about vaccine safety. Some parents worry that the vaccines have not been adequately tested, while others worry about the potential for side effects.

The KFF survey finds that 42% of parents of children ages 5-11 are concerned about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. This concern is higher among Black and Hispanic parents.

Importance of Vaccination

Despite the concerns about vaccine safety, it is important to note that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. The vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all children ages 12 and older get vaccinated against COVID-19. The AAP also recommends that children ages 5-11 get vaccinated once a vaccine is authorized for their age group.
