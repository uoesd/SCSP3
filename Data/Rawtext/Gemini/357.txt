Facebook Employees Locked Out, Global Outages Hit Social Media Giant

Facebook employees were left stranded on Monday after a badge system failure prevented them from accessing buildings, while conference rooms and other internal systems remained inaccessible. The company's internal communication channels were also affected, forcing employees to resort to text messaging and Outlook email.

The outages extended beyond the company's headquarters, with Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp experiencing worldwide disruptions. Users reported issues on DownDetector, indicating that multiple Facebook apps were affected.

Facebook acknowledged the outages on its Twitter account, stating that it was "working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible." However, as of the time of publishing, the outages had persisted for several hours, beginning around 11:45 a.m. ET on Monday.

The outages have had a significant impact on Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. According to Forbes, his net worth dropped by nearly $7 billion in just five hours amidst the disruptions. Facebook's stock also fell by about 5% during the outage period.

The outages coincided with the release of an explosive whistleblower report, which alleged that Facebook knew about the harmful effects of its products but failed to take action. The report has raised questions about the company's ethics and its ability to regulate itself.

Facebook's outages have highlighted the company's reliance on its own infrastructure and the potential consequences of a system failure. The disruptions have also raised concerns about the impact of social media on society and the need for greater regulation of the industry.

As of the time of publishing, Facebook has not provided an update on the cause of the outages or an estimated time for resolution. The company's employees and users continue to experience disruptions, and the full extent of the impact on Facebook's business remains to be seen.
