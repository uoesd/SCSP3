9:29: Revised Timing Highlights Floyd's Prolonged Suffering

CNN – The duration of former Officer Derek Chauvin's knee on George Floyd's neck has been revised to 9 minutes and 29 seconds, according to prosecutors. This corrects the previously reported 8:46 timing, which has become a potent symbol of police brutality.

Prosecuting attorney Jerry Blackwell emphasized the significance of the revised timing in his opening statements: "The evidence will show that Mr. Chauvin had his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds. That is a long time."

The kneeling time was broken down into three sections: 4 minutes and 44 seconds when Floyd was conscious and struggling, 3 minutes and 53 seconds when he was unconscious but still breathing, and 1 minute and 32 seconds when he was unresponsive.

Chauvin's defense attorney, Eric Nelson, accepted the revised timing, stating, "We agree that the evidence will show that Mr. Chauvin's knee was on Mr. Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds." However, he argued that this supports their case, as it demonstrates that Floyd's death was not caused by Chauvin's actions but by underlying health conditions and drug use.

The trial has focused less on the timing difference and more on the extensive evidence presented, including video footage, witness testimony, and medical records.

The 8:46 timing has become culturally significant, inspiring protests, moments of silence, and creative works. It has been widely commemorated, including by Floyd's family, despite the change in timing.

The Hennepin County Attorney's Office has corrected the timing on several occasions. Initial errors in reporting the duration were attributed to the timing of viral bystander video.

Blackwell explained, "The initial timing was based on the bystander video, which did not capture the entire incident. As we obtained more evidence, including body camera footage, we were able to determine the more accurate timing."

The revised timing underscores the prolonged and excessive force used by Chauvin, highlighting the severity of Floyd's suffering and the need for accountability. As the trial continues, the focus remains on the evidence and the pursuit of justice for George Floyd.
