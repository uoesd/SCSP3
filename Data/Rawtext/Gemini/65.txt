'QAnon Shaman' Sentenced to 41 Months for Capitol Riot Role

Jacob Chansley, the self-proclaimed "QAnon shaman" who stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, was sentenced to 41 months in prison on Wednesday. Judge Royce Lamberth, while acknowledging Chansley's remorse, emphasized the severity of his actions: "The conduct in which you engaged on Jan. 6 was horrific. It was an assault on our democracy."

Chansley's sentence falls within the lower range of federal guidelines but is the longest yet imposed on a Capitol riot defendant who has pleaded guilty. He pleaded guilty to a single count of obstructing a proceeding of Congress. Prosecutors had sought a 51-month sentence, highlighting Chansley's early and prominent role in the riot. "He was the face of the riot," said prosecutor Kimberly Paschall. "He was the one who was leading the charge." During the sentencing hearing, a video was shown depicting Chansley howling inside the Capitol, which Paschall described as "chilling."

Chansley's defense attorney argued for a lighter sentence, citing his remorse and mental health issues. In his address to the court, Chansley quoted figures such as Mahatma Gandhi and the Dalai Lama to express his repentance. "I am not a violent man," he said. "I am not a domestic terrorist." However, Lamberth criticized Chansley's conduct, stating that it "undermined the peaceful transfer of presidential power." Chansley will receive credit for time served since his arrest in January.
