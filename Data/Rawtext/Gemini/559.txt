Lawrence Marine Killed in Kabul Bombing Remembered as 'Epitome of Marine Values'

Boston, MA - Marine Sgt. Johanny Rosario, 25, of Lawrence, Massachusetts, was among the 13 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport on August 26, 2021. Rosario, along with Sgt. Nicole L. Gee, was one of two female Marines who lost their lives in the attack, which also claimed the lives of up to 169 Afghans.

Rosario, who had 6 1/2 years of military service, was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star Medal with Valor. She was also the recipient of the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal.

First Lieutenant John "Jack" Coppola, who served with Rosario, praised her service and sacrifice as epitomizing Marine values. "She was a true warrior and a great Marine," Coppola said. "She always put the mission first and was always willing to go the extra mile."

Lawrence Mayor Kendrys Vasquez announced that the city will honor Rosario's heroism. "Johanny was a true hero who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country," Vasquez said. "We will never forget her bravery and her dedication to serving others."

Rosario, who was born in the Dominican Republic, immigrated to the United States with her family when she was a child. She graduated from Lawrence High School in 2015 and briefly attended Bridgewater State University, studying criminal justice.

Retired US Army Major Kathleen Romano, who mentored Rosario through the Upward Bound Program at Salem State University, spoke highly of her leadership and character. "Johanny was a natural leader who always inspired those around her," Romano said. "She was a bright, articulate, and compassionate young woman who had a promising future ahead of her."

Reverend Paul O'Brien, pastor of St. Patrick Parish in Lawrence, where Rosario's family attends church, echoed Romano's sentiments. "Johanny was a role model for our youth," O'Brien said. "She was a young woman of faith who lived her life with purpose and integrity."

The Dominican Republic's embassy in Washington, D.C., issued a statement expressing condolences to Rosario's family and praising her service to the United States. "Sergeant Rosario was a brave and dedicated Marine who made the ultimate sacrifice for her country," the statement said. "Her heroism will never be forgotten."

US Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward J. Markey also paid tribute to Rosario. "Sergeant Rosario was a true American hero who served our country with honor and distinction," Warren said. "Her sacrifice will not be in vain."

"Sergeant Rosario's bravery and dedication to duty are an inspiration to us all," Markey said. "We will never forget her service and her sacrifice."

Frederick W. Clark Jr., president of Bridgewater State University, said that the university community was deeply saddened by Rosario's death. "Johanny was a bright and promising student who had a passion for serving others," Clark said. "We are honored to have known her and to have had her as a member of our community."

A vigil was held in Boston's Seaport District by Massachusetts Fallen Heroes to honor Rosario and the other service members killed in the Kabul bombing. Community members, including an Air Force veteran, expressed deep sorrow and frustration over the loss.

"It's heartbreaking to lose such brave young people," said Jaime Melendez Jr., director of Veterans' Services in Lawrence. "They were doing their duty and they paid the ultimate price."

Wanda Marquez, a program worker at Salem State University's Upward Bound Program, said that Rosario was a shining example for the students she mentored. "Johanny was a role model for our youth," Marquez said. "She showed them that anything is possible if you work hard and never give up on your dreams."

Rosario's family and friends are devastated by her loss, but they are also proud of her service and sacrifice. "Johanny was a hero," said her mother, Sonia Guzmán. "She died doing what she loved, serving her country."

Rosario's legacy will live on through the many lives she touched. She was a true American hero who will never be forgotten.
