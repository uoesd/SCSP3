Trump's Social Media Presence Plummets by 91% After Twitter and Facebook Ban

Former President Donald Trump's mentions on social media have plummeted by a staggering 91% since his ban from Twitter and Facebook in January, according to data from the social media analytics firm Brandwatch.

The ban was imposed following the Capitol riot by Trump supporters attempting to overturn the election results. Twitter and Facebook cited concerns that Trump's posts could incite further violence.

Facebook's Oversight Board, an independent body that reviews content moderation decisions, upheld the decision to suspend Trump, concluding that he had violated the platform's rules and encouraged violence.

Trump remains banned from both Twitter and Facebook, despite his repeated attempts to have his accounts reinstated. He has criticized Facebook's decision, calling it a "disgrace" and an "embarrassment to the country."

"This is a total disgrace and an embarrassment to our Country," Trump said in a statement. "Facebook should pay a political price for this."

In response to the ban, Trump has started a new personal blog to communicate directly with his followers. He has also encouraged his supporters to share his blog posts on Twitter and Facebook.

Previously, Trump communicated with subscribers and followers via email. However, his adviser Jason Miller hinted that Trump may return to social media with his own platform.

"We're going to redefine the game," Miller said. "We're going to build a platform that's going to be bigger and better than anything that's currently out there."

The ban on Trump has sparked a debate about the role of social media companies in regulating political speech. Some argue that the companies have a responsibility to prevent the spread of misinformation and violence, while others believe that they are infringing on free speech rights.

The long-term impact of Trump's ban on social media remains to be seen. However, it is clear that his ability to reach his supporters has been significantly diminished.
