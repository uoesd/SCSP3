Ever Given's Phallic Route Causes Suez Canal Traffic Jam

In a bizarre incident, a massive cargo ship, Ever Given, accidentally charted a route resembling a penis, testicles, and buttocks in the Red Sea before getting stuck in the Suez Canal, causing a significant interruption in global trade.

VesselFinder, a nautical tracking service, confirmed the authenticity of the ship's route data, dismissing suggestions that the data had been manipulated. "We can confirm that the Ever Given did indeed sail in the shape of a penis," a VesselFinder spokesperson said.

John Scott-Railton, a disinformation researcher, described the ship's route and subsequent mishap as "innocent, but terrible luck." He noted that the ship's captain likely did not intend to draw a phallic shape but rather made a navigational error.

The Ever Given, a colossal container ship over four football fields in length and weighing over 440 million pounds, was en route to the Netherlands from China. On Tuesday, the ship became lodged in the canal due to high winds and a dust storm, blocking it sideways.

An attempt to free the vessel involving small Egyptian vessels initially failed, but partial success was achieved on Wednesday following the incident. Despite fears that the channel might be blocked for days, traffic in the canal resumed, highlighting its importance for global trade.

Before the incident, other ships in the canal expressed concern over delays due to the Ever Given running aground. The Suez Canal is a vital link for roughly 12 percent of global trade, connecting Africa and Asia.

The incident has raised questions about the safety and efficiency of the Suez Canal, which has been plagued by delays and accidents in recent years. Experts have called for increased investment in the canal's infrastructure and operations to prevent similar disruptions in the future.

As the Ever Given remains stuck in the canal, salvage crews continue to work around the clock to free the ship and restore normal traffic flow. The incident has served as a reminder of the fragility of global supply chains and the importance of maintaining key maritime routes.
