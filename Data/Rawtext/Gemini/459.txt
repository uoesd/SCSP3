Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: A Financial Journey from Royal Dependency to Hollywood Heights

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's departure from the British royal family in early 2020 marked a significant shift in their financial circumstances. Once heavily reliant on royal funding, the couple has since established a substantial net worth through lucrative entertainment contracts and personal ventures.

Royal Expenses and Financial Independence

As senior royals, Harry and Meghan's expenses were primarily covered by the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate established for the Prince of Wales. The Duchy provided approximately 95% of their expenses, while the remaining 5% came from the Sovereign Grant, a public fund used to support the official duties of the monarch and their immediate family.

Upon stepping down as senior royals, Harry and Meghan became financially independent. Harry inherited a $13 million trust fund from his late mother, Princess Diana, while Meghan contributed approximately $2 million from her successful acting career.

Montecito Mansion and Security Costs

The couple purchased a $14.7 million estate in Montecito, California, in 2020. The sprawling property boasts nine bedrooms, 16 bathrooms, and a tennis court. Their annual security costs are estimated to be around $3 million, a significant expense that reflects their high-profile status.

Entertainment Contracts and Netflix Deal

Harry and Meghan have leveraged their celebrity status to secure lucrative contracts in the entertainment industry. In September 2020, they signed a multi-year deal with Netflix worth an estimated $100 million. Their first Netflix project, 'Heart of Invictus,' follows competitors preparing for the Invictus Games, a sporting event for wounded, injured, and sick service personnel.

Spotify Partnership and Podcast Production

The couple also announced a partnership with Spotify to produce podcasts. The deal is reportedly worth $35 million and will see Harry and Meghan create content that focuses on topics such as mental health and social justice.

Meghan's Book and Literary Success

Meghan Markle's debut children's book, 'The Bench,' became a New York Times bestseller in the children's picture book category. Speculation suggests that Meghan could have received a $700,000 advance for the book.

Growing Net Worth and Financial Security

Harry and Meghan's net worth has grown significantly since their departure from the royal family. Their combined income from entertainment contracts, book deals, and other ventures is estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars.

Financial Independence and Personal Fulfillment

While their financial independence has brought with it increased responsibilities and expenses, it has also allowed Harry and Meghan to pursue their own passions and interests. They have established a non-profit organization, Archewell, which focuses on social impact initiatives.

Conclusion

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's financial journey has been marked by both challenges and opportunities. From their initial reliance on royal funding to their current status as financially independent entrepreneurs, they have navigated a significant transition. Their lucrative entertainment contracts and personal ventures have enabled them to establish a substantial net worth and pursue their passions while continuing to make a positive impact on the world.
