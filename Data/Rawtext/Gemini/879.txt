Tiger Woods' SUV Black Box Data Sought After Crash

Los Angeles, CA - A local resident who was the first on the scene of Tiger Woods' car accident last week found the golf legend unconscious in his SUV, according to the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department.

The resident, who has not been identified, told deputies that he found Woods slumped over the steering wheel of his SUV, which had rolled over several times after striking a median and a tree.

"He was unconscious at the time," said Sheriff Alex Villanueva. "He was not able to communicate with the deputy."

Woods was transported to a local hospital, where he underwent surgery for a shattered ankle and two leg fractures. He has since had multiple surgeries and is recovering at home.

The LA Sheriff's Department is seeking to review the vehicle's black box data to understand the pre-collision speed and brake usage.

"We're going to be looking at the black box to determine if there was any mechanical failure or if there was any driver error," Villanueva said.

There were no signs of impairment by substances, and no tests were administered nor charges filed against Woods.

"There was no evidence of alcohol or drugs at the scene," Villanueva said.

Speculations suggest that Woods might have been distracted or asleep prior to the crash.

"We don't know what caused him to lose control of the vehicle," Villanueva said. "We're still investigating."

Woods testified to deputies that he had no recollection of driving or how the accident happened.

"He said he didn't remember driving," Villanueva said.

The first responder, a mystery man living near the crash site, attempted to communicate with Woods but received no response.

"He tried to talk to him, but he didn't get any response," Villanueva said.

Woods was described as "calm and lucid" when fire officials extricated him from the wreckage.

"He was able to answer questions and follow commands," Villanueva said.

Woods thanked fellow golfers and fans for their support on his first public comment since the accident.

"I'm so grateful for the outpouring of support and prayers that I've received," Woods said in a statement. "I'm especially grateful to the first responders, the surgeons, and the nurses who have taken such good care of me."

Rory McIlroy and other golfers wore red and black in solidarity, expressing their well-wishes for Woods' recovery.

"We're all thinking of Tiger and his family," McIlroy said. "We're all hoping for a speedy recovery."

The investigation into the crash is ongoing.
