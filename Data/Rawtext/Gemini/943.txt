Impeachment Drive Against Trump Begins, 25th Amendment Invocation Urged

Washington, D.C. - Congressional Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have initiated the process of removing President Donald Trump from office, potentially making him the first president to be impeached twice.

"The President of the United States incited an insurrection against the United States," Pelosi declared. "He must be held accountable."

The House is expected to vote on articles of impeachment as early as Wednesday, following the storming of the Capitol by Trump's supporters last week.

25th Amendment Invocation

Before moving towards impeachment, the House will vote on Tuesday on a resolution urging Vice President Mike Pence and Cabinet officials to invoke the 25th Amendment. The amendment allows the vice president and the Cabinet to remove a president deemed unfit for office.

"We have 24 hours to act before we move forward with impeachment," said House Democrat Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking Democrat.

Lack of Evidence of Election Fraud

Trump's impeachment drive stems from his repeated claims of widespread election fraud, which have been repeatedly debunked. Several judges and Attorney General William Barr have found no evidence to support these claims.

"There is no evidence of widespread fraud," said Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). "The election was not stolen."

Corporate America Withdraws Support

In the wake of the Capitol riot, corporate America has begun to withhold campaign contributions from lawmakers who supported challenges to President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College win.

"We will not support those who undermine our democratic process," said Kim Keck, CEO and President of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.

Impeachment Trial Timing

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that an impeachment trial could not begin before Inauguration Day on January 20th.

"We have a lot to do before the end of this Congress," McConnell said. "An impeachment trial would be highly divisive."

Republican Views on Impeachment

Republicans are divided on the issue of impeachment. Some, like Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), argue that it would be "divisive and unnecessary."

However, others, like Senator Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska), are open to considering it. "I'm going to listen to the evidence," Sasse said.

Impact on Biden's Presidency

The possibility of impeachment raises questions about its impact on the start of President-elect Biden's term.

"We need to focus on the transition of power," said Representative Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.). "Impeachment could be a distraction."

Democrats' Resolve

Despite Republican opposition, Democrats are determined to hold Trump accountable.

"We must send a clear message that no one is above the law," said Representative David Cicilline (D-R.I.).
