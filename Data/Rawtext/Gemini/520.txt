Hurricane Ida Victims in Queens Lament Insufficient Aid, Housing Crisis

In the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, which ravaged New York City in September 2021, many residents continue to grapple with the devastating consequences, including severe property damage and a lack of adequate assistance.

Amrita Bhagwandin's home in Queens is a testament to the storm's destructive force. The floodwaters that surged through her house caused extensive damage, leaving her with costly repairs. "The water was up to my knees," Bhagwandin recalled, her voice filled with anguish. "Everything was destroyed—my furniture, my appliances, my clothes."

Bhagwandin's experience is far from isolated. Across New York City, countless homeowners and renters have been left in dire straits, facing challenges ranging from selling damaged properties to finding affordable housing. The storm has also exacerbated the city's ongoing housing crisis, particularly for low-income and marginalized communities.

"We're seeing a lot of people who are struggling to make ends meet," said Becca Talzek, deputy director of Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy organization. "They're facing eviction, they're losing their homes, and they're not getting the help they need."

One of the most pressing concerns for victims is the lack of sufficient aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). As of December 3, more than 88,700 New Yorkers had applied for FEMA assistance, with $163.7 million approved. However, many residents report that the aid they have received is inadequate to cover their losses.

"I applied for FEMA assistance, but I was only approved for a small amount of money," said Bhagwandin. "It's not enough to cover the cost of repairs, and I don't know how I'm going to pay for everything."

FEMA spokesperson Kevin Sur acknowledged that the agency is facing challenges in meeting the needs of all applicants. "We understand that many people are still struggling, and we're working to get them the assistance they need," Sur said. "We're extending deadlines and working with our partners to provide additional support."

In response to the outcry from victims, Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman have called for more substantial aid from FEMA. "We need to make sure that everyone who has been impacted by this storm gets the help they need to rebuild their lives," Ocasio-Cortez said.

FEMA has since extended the deadline for financial assistance applications to March 16, 2022. Governor Kathy Hochul has also extended the deadline for a relief fund for undocumented New Yorkers who are excluded from FEMA assistance.

Mayor Bill de Blasio has promised long-term housing support for storm victims, but specific plans are still under evaluation. "We're committed to helping New Yorkers recover from this storm," said Lauren Bale, a spokesperson for de Blasio. "We're working with our partners to provide housing assistance, financial support, and other resources."

Despite these efforts, victims express frustration with the lack of urgency from politicians and agencies in addressing their needs. "We're still waiting for help," said Bhagwandin. "We've been forgotten."

Mercedes Padilla, a spokesperson for the state Office of New Americans, emphasized the need for ongoing support for immigrant communities affected by the storm. "Undocumented New Yorkers are particularly vulnerable in these situations," Padilla said. "We need to make sure that they have access to the resources they need to rebuild their lives."

The challenges faced by Hurricane Ida victims underscore the urgent need for comprehensive housing policies that address the needs of low-income and marginalized communities. The storm has laid bare the systemic inequalities that exist in New York City, and it is imperative that policymakers take action to ensure that all residents have access to safe and affordable housing.
