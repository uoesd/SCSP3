Trump Acquitted in Second Impeachment Trial, but GOP Leader Condemns Him

WASHINGTON (AP) – Former President Donald Trump was acquitted Saturday in his second impeachment trial for inciting the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6. The Senate voted 57-43, falling short of the two-thirds majority needed for conviction.

Seven Republicans joined all Democrats in voting to convict Trump, a significant break from the party's near-unanimous support for him during his first impeachment trial.

Despite the acquittal, GOP leader Mitch McConnell condemned Trump as "practically and morally responsible" for the insurrection.

"There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day," McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. "The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president."

President Joe Biden emphasized the bipartisan nature of the conviction vote and the importance of defending truth.

"This vote makes it clear that there is no place for violence in our politics," Biden said in a statement. "Truth and accountability prevailed today."

The decision not to include witnesses was made to avoid prolonging the trial, which could hinder Biden's legislative agenda.

"We have to move forward," said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). "We have a lot of work to do for the American people."

House prosecutors described Trump as the "inciter in chief" with a months-long campaign of violent rhetoric.

"He told his supporters to 'fight like hell' and that they would need to 'take back our country with strength,'" said Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), one of the House prosecutors. "He told them to march to the Capitol and 'stop the steal.'"

Trump's lawyers argued his words were not intended to incite violence and framed the impeachment as a "witch hunt."

"This is not a criminal trial," said Michael van der Veen, one of Trump's lawyers. "This is a political process designed to punish President Trump for his speech."

Senators acknowledged the gravity of the riot but were divided on Trump's responsibility and the appropriateness of impeachment.

"The evidence is clear that President Trump incited this insurrection," said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), one of the seven Republicans who voted to convict. "He bears responsibility for the violence that occurred."

"This is not a criminal trial," said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who voted to acquit. "This is a political process, and I do not believe that the evidence supports conviction."

The trial highlighted the fragility of America's democratic traditions and the country's deep divisions.

"We have come dangerously close to losing our democracy," said Biden. "We must never forget what happened on January 6th, and we must do everything in our power to prevent it from ever happening again."

Trump, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, released a statement after the vote saying, "This has been yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our Country."

The acquittal is a significant victory for Trump, who remains a powerful figure in the Republican Party. It is unclear whether the trial will have any long-term impact on his political future or the country's political divisions.
