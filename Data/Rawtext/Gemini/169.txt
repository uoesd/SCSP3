Legendary Navy SEAL Commander Richard Marcinko Passes Away

Richard "Dick" Marcinko, the founding commander of the elite SEAL Team 6, passed away on Christmas night at the age of 81. The news of his demise was shared by his son, Matthew Marcinko, on Twitter.

"It is with a heavy heart that I share the news of the passing of my father, Richard Marcinko," Matthew wrote. "He died of a heart attack on Christmas night."

Marcinko's illustrious career in the Navy SEALS began in 1967 when he was deployed to Vietnam as a member of SEAL Team Two. During his time in the Mekong Delta, he led a highly successful operation that earned him the Bronze Star with Combat "V."

In 1979, during the Iran hostage crisis, Marcinko was part of the Terrorist Action Team (TAT) tasked with freeing American hostages in Tehran. The failure of Operation Eagle Claw during the crisis prompted Marcinko to propose the formation of a dedicated counter-terrorist unit, which later became known as SEAL Team 6.

Under Marcinko's leadership, SEAL Team 6 gained fame for leading the raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011. Marcinko's innovative leadership and unwavering determination left a lasting legacy on the unit.

After retiring from the Navy in 1989, Marcinko became a best-selling author with books such as "Rogue Warrior," which chronicled his experiences in the SEALS.

"Dick Marcinko was imaginative, bold, and a warrior at heart," said Retired Navy SEAL Adm. Eric Olson. "His contributions to the Navy SEALS and his innovative leadership of SEAL Team 6 left a lasting legacy."

Marcinko's son, Matthew, recalled his father's unwavering spirit and dedication to his family. "He was a great man who loved his country and his family," Matthew said. "He will be deeply missed."

Marcinko's passing has been met with an outpouring of tributes from fellow SEALs, military leaders, and politicians. His legacy as a fearless warrior and a visionary leader will continue to inspire generations of service members.

In a statement, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said, "Richard Marcinko was a true American hero who dedicated his life to serving our country. His leadership and innovation shaped the Navy SEALS into the elite force they are today."

Marcinko's unwavering determination and unwavering patriotism left an indelible mark on the United States military. His legacy as a legendary Navy SEAL commander and a fearless warrior will continue to inspire and motivate those who serve in the armed forces.
