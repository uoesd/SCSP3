Witness Recounts Explosive Argument Between Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie

NORTH PORT, Florida (WABC) – A new witness has come forward to provide details about an explosive argument between Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie that occurred at a restaurant in Jackson, Wyoming, just days before Petito's disappearance.

Nina Celie Angelo, a patron at the Merry Piglet restaurant on August 27, witnessed the altercation firsthand. "I was sitting at the bar when I heard a commotion," Angelo said. "I looked up and saw a man and a woman arguing with the hostess."

The Blue-Collar Restaurant Group, which owns the Merry Piglet, confirmed that Petito and Laundrie were present at their establishment that day. "We can confirm that Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie were in our restaurant on August 27," a spokesperson for the group said.

According to Angelo, Laundrie was "screaming at the hostess" while Petito stood nearby, visibly upset. "He was very angry and temperamental," Angelo recalled. "The hostess was trying to calm him down, but he wouldn't listen."

Angelo observed Laundrie entering and exiting the restaurant multiple times, continuing his altercation with staff members. "He was very aggressive," Angelo said. "It was uncomfortable to watch."

Petito, on the other hand, appeared to be trying to diffuse the situation. "She was apologizing to the staff for his behavior," Angelo said. "She seemed embarrassed and upset."

Angelo's account aligns with other reports that have emerged about Laundrie's erratic behavior during the couple's cross-country road trip. Petito and Laundrie were traveling in a cargo van they had converted into a makeshift recreational vehicle.

The argument at the Merry Piglet led to both Petito and Laundrie eventually leaving the restaurant. "Gabby was visibly distraught," Angelo said. "She was crying and trying to calm Brian down."

The public's attention on the Gabby Petito case has intensified since her disappearance on September 11. Laundrie, who was named a person of interest in Petito's disappearance, has been missing since September 14.

The search for Laundrie continues, and the FBI is offering a $30,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.
