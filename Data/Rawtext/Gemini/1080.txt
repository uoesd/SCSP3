Hulu's Gabby Petito Documentary Recommendation Stuns Grieving Mother

Nichole Schmidt, the mother of slain YouTuber Gabby Petito, expressed shock and pain after Hulu recommended a documentary about her daughter's tragic death.

"I'm still in shock and pain over losing my daughter," Schmidt tweeted. "And now Hulu is recommending a documentary about her death? This is surreal."

Gabby Petito, 22, was found dead in a Wyoming campground on September 19, days after being reported missing. Her death sent shockwaves across the nation and sparked a massive search for her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, who was identified as a person of interest but never named a suspect.

"It's like they're profiting off of my daughter's death," Schmidt said. "It's disgusting."

Social media users offered support and prayers to Gabby's family, acknowledging her impact worldwide.

"Gabby's story touched the hearts of millions," one user wrote. "Her family deserves privacy and respect during this difficult time."

Wyoming coroners determined Gabby Petito died from strangulation, and her death was predicted to be three to four weeks before her body was found.

"The manner of death is homicide," Dr. Brent Blue, Teton County coroner, said. "The cause of death is strangulation."

Gabby had been traveling across America's midwest with Laundrie, who disappeared shortly after she was reported missing. His remains were later found in Florida, with the cause of death still unknown and awaiting further tests by an anthropologist.

The investigation into Gabby's death includes examining potential notes and drawings, with a focus on a notebook found near Laundrie's partial remains.

"We're looking at everything," Paul Belli, president of the International Homicide Investigations Association, said. "We're looking at notes, drawings, anything that could give us insight into what happened."

Criminologists and homicide investigators speculate on the possibility of finding a suicide note or confession within Laundrie's notebook.

"It's possible that Laundrie left behind a note explaining what happened," Casey Jordan, a criminologist, said. "He had the opportunity to disturb evidence, so it's hard to say what we'll find."

Laundrie's actions after Gabby's disappearance have raised suspicions, including his use of her credit card and his attempt to flee the country.

"He had the opportunity to come forward and tell us what happened," Belli said. "But he chose to run and hide."

The investigation into Gabby's death is ongoing, and her family continues to seek justice for her.

"We're not going to give up until we find out what happened to Gabby," Schmidt said. "She deserves justice."
