Los Angeles, California - Tiger Woods is recovering at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after being transferred from Harbor-UCLA Medical Center following a rollover car accident earlier this week.

"Tiger Woods was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for continuing orthopedic care and recovery," said Dr. Anish Mahajan, Chief Medical Officer at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. "His injuries are serious, but he is expected to recover."

Woods underwent emergency surgery on Tuesday for significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity. According to Dr. Mahajan, the injuries were stabilized with a rod, screws, and pins.

"We're very fortunate that Mr. Woods was able to come out of this alive," said Carlos Gonzalez, a Sheriff's Deputy with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "The vehicle was severely damaged, and it's a miracle that he survived."

First responders had to extricate Woods from the vehicle after the accident, which occurred in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. Woods was initially taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he underwent emergency surgery.

The Woods family released a statement expressing gratitude for the support and messages they have received. "We are so grateful for the outpouring of support and prayers that we have received during this difficult time," the statement read. "We will continue to provide updates on Tiger's condition as they become available."

Woods' injuries are expected to require a long recovery. A source close to the golfer said that Woods is optimistic about his resilience but will have to make decisions regarding his career as he recovers.

"Tiger is a fighter," the source said. "He's going to do everything he can to get back on the golf course, but he knows that it's going to be a long road."

Woods is one of the most successful golfers in history, having won 15 major championships. He is widely considered one of the greatest golfers of all time.

The accident has sent shockwaves through the golf world and beyond. Many fellow golfers and celebrities have expressed their support for Woods and wished him a speedy recovery.

"Tiger is a true champion," said Rory McIlroy, a fellow professional golfer. "He's going to come back from this stronger than ever."

The investigation into the accident is ongoing. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is investigating the cause of the crash.
