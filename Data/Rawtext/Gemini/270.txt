Rodgers Tests Positive for COVID-19, Misses Chiefs Game Amid Vaccination Controversy

Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has tested positive for COVID-19 and will miss Sunday's Week 9 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported.

Rodgers, who has been placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list, will be replaced as the starter by Jordan Love.

The news comes amid controversy surrounding Rodgers' vaccination status. Despite previously stating that he was "immunized," Rodgers is not vaccinated against COVID-19, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport confirmed.

Rodgers sought an exemption from the NFL's COVID-19 protocols based on his antibody levels but was denied, according to NFL Network Reporter Mike Garafolo. He then underwent homeopathic treatment to raise his antibody levels, which the NFL, NFLPA, and an infectious disease consultant did not recognize as valid protection.

As an unvaccinated player, Rodgers is subject to various restrictions, including daily testing and mandatory mask-wearing.

The NFL-NFLPA COVID protocols outline that a player could be considered fully vaccinated with one shot, provided specific antibody levels are met. However, sources confirmed to NFL Network that Rodgers has not received any COVID-19 vaccine.

Packers coach Matt LaFleur declined to comment on Rodgers' vaccination status, directing questions to Rodgers himself.

"I'm not going to get into the medical privacy of our players," LaFleur said. "That's something that Aaron and I will talk about."

Rodgers cannot rejoin the team until Nov. 13, the day before their Week 10 game against the Seattle Seahawks.

"He's going to be out this week, and we'll see where it goes from there," LaFleur said.

The Packers are now 7-1 this season and face a tough test against the Chiefs, who are 4-4. Love will make his first career start in place of Rodgers.

"I'm excited for the opportunity," Love said. "I've been preparing for this moment my whole life."
