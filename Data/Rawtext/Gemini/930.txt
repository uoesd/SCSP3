Trump Acquitted in Second Impeachment Trial, Leaving Open Path for Future Office

CNN – The Senate voted to acquit former President Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial on Saturday, with a 43 not guilty to 57 guilty vote. The outcome was largely expected, as most Republicans had already signaled their opposition to convicting Trump on charges of inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6.

The trial, which lasted just over a week, was a highly partisan affair, with Democrats arguing that Trump's actions on January 6 were a clear and present danger to American democracy. Republicans, on the other hand, largely dismissed the charges as politically motivated and argued that the trial was unconstitutional because Trump was no longer in office.

In the end, the vote to acquit Trump fell largely along party lines, with all but seven Republicans voting not guilty. The seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump were:

  • Sen. Richard Burr (N.C.)
  • Sen. Bill Cassidy (La.)
  • Sen. Susan Collins (Maine)
  • Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska)
  • Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah)
  • Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.)
  • Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.)

The vote to acquit Trump was a major victory for the former president and his supporters. It also highlighted the strong hold that Trump still has over the Republican Party. As CNN reporter Jamie Gangel noted, "Trump's grip on the Republican Party is as strong as ever."

Trump's acquittal also leaves open the possibility of him holding future office. Trump has repeatedly hinted that he may run for president again in 2024, and his acquittal will only fuel those speculations.

However, Trump's acquittal does not mean that he is out of the woods. There are ongoing criminal investigations and pending cases related to the Capitol riot and Trump's efforts to influence election results. It is possible that Trump could still face criminal charges, which could potentially bar him from holding future office.

The impeachment trial also shed light on the events leading up to the Capitol riot. The impeachment managers used extensive video footage to make their case against Trump, showing how he had repeatedly encouraged his supporters to violence in the weeks leading up to January 6.

The trial also revealed new details about Trump's behavior on January 6. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) testified that Trump had been told that the Capitol was under attack but had refused to call off his supporters.

Trump's acquittal is a setback for those who believe that he should be held accountable for his actions on January 6. However, it is important to remember that the impeachment trial was just one step in a larger process. There are still ongoing criminal investigations and pending cases related to the Capitol riot, and Trump's influence and the events leading up to the riot will continue to be subjects of public and legal scrutiny.

Reaction to the Verdict

The verdict in Trump's impeachment trial was met with mixed reactions. Democrats were largely disappointed, while Republicans were generally pleased.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who voted to acquit Trump, said that he believed the trial was unconstitutional. However, he also criticized Trump's actions on January 6, saying that he "bears responsibility" for the riot.

"There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day," McConnell said. "The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president."

Trump himself has not commented on the verdict, but he is expected to release a statement in the coming days.

The Future of Trumpism

Trump's acquittal is a major victory for the former president and his supporters. However, it is unclear what the future holds for Trumpism. Trump's influence over the Republican Party is undeniable, but it is also clear that there is a growing number of Republicans who are willing to stand up to him.

Republican women, in particular, have shown courage by standing up to Trump. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) both voted to convict Trump in the impeachment trial, despite the fact that it could cost them their political careers.

The future of Trumpism is uncertain. However, it is clear that the movement is not going away anytime soon. Trump's acquittal will only embolden his supporters, and it is likely that he will continue to play a major role in American politics for years to come.

Conclusion

Trump's acquittal in his second impeachment trial is a major victory for the former president and his supporters. However, it is important to remember that the impeachment trial was just one step in a larger process. There are still ongoing criminal investigations and pending cases related to the Capitol riot, and Trump's influence and the events leading up to the riot
