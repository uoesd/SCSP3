Facebook Cracks Down on Anti-COVID Restriction Movement in Germany

Sept 16 (Reuters) – Facebook has removed a network of accounts linked to an anti-COVID restrictions movement in Germany, part of a new crackdown on coordinated campaigns by real users causing harm on and off its platforms.

"We're expanding our tactics to shut down harmful coordinated groups of real-user accounts that violate our policies," said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's Head of Security Policy.

The move targets campaigns of "coordinated social harm" by real users systematically violating policies, highlighting the significance for handling organized political and social movements on Facebook's platforms.

The Querdenken movement, which has been accused of using accounts to spread harmful health misinformation and incite violence, is linked to off-platform physical violence and COVID-related social harms.

Facebook is not banning all Querdenken content but has blocked its domains and taken down fewer than 150 accounts. The move underlines Facebook's ongoing efforts to combat misinformation and harmful content related to COVID-19.

"We've seen this group repeatedly violate our policies and spread misinformation about COVID-19," Gleicher said. "We're taking action to protect our users from harmful content and to prevent this group from using our platform to spread misinformation and incite violence."

The action has sparked debate on how platforms should enforce against offline activities linked to online behavior. Some argue that platforms have a responsibility to prevent harm caused by their users, while others maintain that freedom of speech should be protected even if it leads to offline consequences.

Facebook's move is part of a broader effort to address the spread of misinformation and harmful content on its platforms. The company has faced criticism for not doing enough to combat these issues, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The removal of the Querdenken accounts is a significant step in Facebook's efforts to address these concerns. It remains to be seen how effective the new tactics will be in preventing coordinated social harm and whether they will have a broader impact on the way platforms handle organized political and social movements.
