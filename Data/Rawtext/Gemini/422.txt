Jurors in Chauvin Trial Break Silence, Detail Life-Altering Experience

CNN – Jurors from the Derek Chauvin trial have spoken out for the first time since the verdict, describing the trial as a life-altering experience that continues to haunt them.

The jurors, who remained anonymous throughout the trial, spoke to ABC News in a series of interviews, sharing their perspectives on the trial and its aftermath.

Evidence-Based Verdict

The jurors emphasized that their verdict was based solely on the evidence presented during the trial, not on their personal views on race.

"We based our verdict on the evidence that was presented in court," said Sherri Belton Hardeman, a juror. "We did not base it on our personal beliefs or our personal experiences."

Video Evidence

Video evidence, particularly the footage of Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck for over nine minutes, played a significant role in the jury's deliberation.

"The video was very powerful," said Nicole Deters, another juror. "It was very difficult to watch, but it was also very important for us to see what happened."

Due Diligence

The jurors took their responsibility seriously, seeking to ensure that due diligence was done in their deliberations.

"We wanted to make sure that we got it right," said Brandon Mitchell, a juror. "We didn't want to make any mistakes."

Emotional Toll

The trial took an emotional toll on the jurors, with some seeking counseling and therapy to cope with the stress.

"It was a very difficult experience," said Jodi Doud, a juror. "I'm still processing everything that happened."

No Influence of Race

Despite widespread protests framing the incident within systemic racism, the jurors insisted that race did not influence their deliberations.

"We did not talk about race in the jury room," said Lisa Christensen, a juror. "We focused on the evidence."

Bystander Videos

Bystander videos were crucial in capturing the events leading to George Floyd's death. The jurors praised the individuals who recorded the videos, saying they played a vital role in holding Chauvin accountable.

Emotional Impact

The jurors found watching the video of Floyd's death repeatedly to be emotionally taxing.

"It was very difficult to watch," said Hardeman. "It's something that I'll never forget."

Ongoing Impact

The jurors continue to feel the emotional impact of their experience. Some said they no longer want to see the video of Floyd's death.

"I don't think I'll ever be able to watch that video again," said Deters. "It's too painful."

Life-Altering Experience

The jurors described the trial as a life-altering experience that has changed them forever.

"It's something that I'll never forget," said Mitchell. "It's something that I'll carry with me for the rest of my life."

Jury Deliberations

The jury deliberated for over 10 hours across two days before reaching a unanimous verdict. The jurors said they wanted to make sure they had considered all the evidence before making a decision.

"We wanted to make sure that we got it right," said Christensen. "We didn't want to rush to judgment."

Unanimous Verdict

The jurors said they were relieved to reach a unanimous verdict.

"It was a difficult decision, but we all agreed in the end," said Doud. "We felt that we had done our duty."

Aftermath

The jurors said they have been following the aftermath of the trial and are pleased with the guilty verdict.

"I'm glad that Chauvin was found guilty," said Hardeman. "I think it's a step in the right direction."

Call for Unity

The jurors called for unity in the wake of the trial.

"I hope that this verdict can help to bring people together," said Mitchell. "We need to work together to address the issue of police brutality."
