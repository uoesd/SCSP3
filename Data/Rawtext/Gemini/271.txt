Nursing Homes Witness Resurgence of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Amid Delta Variant Surge

Long-term care facilities have borne the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic, accounting for a staggering 31% of all US deaths from the virus as of June 30, 2021. While the post-vaccine rollout brought a glimmer of hope, with weekly cases and deaths in these facilities plummeting to an all-time low in June 2021, the emergence of the highly transmissible Delta variant has cast a dark shadow over the progress made.

In August 2021, nursing homes experienced a steep increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Nearly 1,800 COVID-19 deaths were reported in US nursing homes in August 2021, the highest since February 2021. This alarming surge represents a quadrupling of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes between July and August 2021. Similarly, COVID-19 cases in nursing homes grew by a staggering 440% between July and August 2021.

The resurgence of COVID-19 in nursing homes is a stark reminder that the pandemic continues to disproportionately impact older adults and people with disabilities. These vulnerable populations are at increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. In response to the rising cases and deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) endorsed an extra dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for residents of long-term care settings. Additionally, the Biden administration announced a staff vaccination mandate for nursing homes.

As of mid-September 2021, about 84% of nursing home residents and 64% of nursing home staff were vaccinated. While these vaccination rates are encouraging, they still fall short of the levels needed to achieve herd immunity and protect residents and staff from the virus. The ongoing efforts to increase vaccination rates in nursing homes are crucial to mitigating the impact of COVID-19 in these vulnerable settings.

The resurgence of COVID-19 in nursing homes underscores the need for continued vigilance and adherence to infection control measures. Regular testing, proper use of personal protective equipment, and social distancing remain essential to prevent the spread of the virus in these facilities. As the pandemic continues to evolve, it is imperative that nursing homes, policymakers, and public health officials work together to protect the health and well-being of our most vulnerable populations.
