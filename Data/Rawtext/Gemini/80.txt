Capitol Riot: Lawmakers Condemn Violence, Some Call Rioters 'Patriots'

Washington, D.C. - Lawmakers have expressed outrage over the violence that erupted at the Capitol on Wednesday, with some condemning the rioters as "domestic terrorists" while others referred to them as "patriots."

The riot, which was emboldened by President Donald Trump and Republican rally attendees, including state lawmakers, resulted in the deaths of at least five people, including one police officer.

One GOP state lawmaker, Derrick Evans of West Virginia, has resigned after attending the rally before the riot. The rally, which supported Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, was attended by Republican lawmakers who echoed the president's baseless claims of voter fraud.

Rioters, including members of the Proud Boys, classified as a hate group, stormed the Capitol building during the certification of the election results, in an attempted coup. Investigations into the riot are ongoing.

A Senate aide, Eugene Goodman, secured the electoral vote boxes during the riot, ensuring they were not damaged. Despite the violence, the vote to certify President-elect Joe Biden proceeded hours later, and Trump promised an orderly transition.

Calls for Trump's impeachment on charges of "incitement of an insurrection" have emerged, as well as backlash against Republican lawmakers who attended the rally.

Lawmakers' Reactions

Democratic lawmakers have condemned the violence, calling it an attack on democracy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, "This was not a protest. This was an insurrection."

Republican lawmakers have been more divided in their reactions. Some, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have condemned the violence, while others have downplayed it or defended the rioters.

Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), who objected to the certification of the election results, said, "I do not believe that the violence we saw today was the result of anything that I said."

Ongoing Investigations

The FBI is investigating the riot, and several arrests have been made. The House of Representatives has also launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump's role in inciting the violence.

Backlash Against Republican Lawmakers

Republican lawmakers who attended the rally before the riot are facing backlash from their constituents and fellow party members. Some have been censured or stripped of their committee assignments.

The Republican National Committee has also condemned the violence, saying, "The violence and destruction that took place at the Capitol today was unacceptable and un-American."

Conclusion

The Capitol riot was a dark day for American democracy. The violence and attempted coup were a direct result of Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud and the support he received from Republican lawmakers.

The ongoing investigations will shed light on the extent of the conspiracy and the role played by Trump and his allies. The backlash against Republican lawmakers who supported Trump's efforts to overturn the election results is a sign that the country is not willing to tolerate such behavior.
