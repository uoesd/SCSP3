Kabul Airport Reopening Uncertain, Taliban's Promises Under Scrutiny

KABUL, Afghanistan – Qatar's top diplomat has cautioned that it remains unclear when Kabul's international airport will resume operations, casting doubt on the immediate prospects for evacuations and humanitarian aid delivery.

"It's still not clear when the airport will be reopened," Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammad bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told reporters in Doha on Tuesday. "We are working with the Taliban and other stakeholders to ensure that the airport is reopened as soon as possible."

Experts from Qatar and Turkey are currently working to repair and reopen the airport, which was damaged during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal and a subsequent suicide bombing that killed 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members.

The Taliban, which seized control of Afghanistan in August, have pledged to allow women and girls to go to school and people to travel freely. However, their previous rule in the late 1990s was marked by severe oppression, particularly towards women.

In the western city of Herat, dozens of women took to the streets on Tuesday to protest for their rights, including participation in the Taliban's Cabinet.

"We want the Taliban to respect our rights," said Friba Kabrzani, one of the protest organizers. "We want to be able to go to school, work, and participate in society."

Maryam Ebram, another protest participant, said: "We are not afraid of the Taliban. We will continue to fight for our rights."

The Taliban have faced international pressure to uphold their promises on women's rights and other issues.

"We need to engage with the Taliban to verify their promises," said UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. "We need to see tangible action on the ground."

The closure of Kabul's airport has hindered escape for those fearing the Taliban and delayed the delivery of humanitarian aid.

"The airport is a lifeline for Afghanistan," said Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkish Foreign Minister. "We are committed to working with Qatar and other partners to reopen it as soon as possible."

Qatar remains hopeful and engaged in dialogue with the Taliban to restart airport operations.

"We are confident that we can reach an agreement with the Taliban that will allow the airport to reopen," said Al Thani. "We are committed to working with the Taliban to build a stable and prosperous Afghanistan."

However, the Taliban's track record and the ongoing security challenges in Afghanistan raise concerns about the prospects for a smooth reopening of the airport and the long-term safety of those who remain in the country.

The Afghan women protestors in Herat vowed to continue their activism and demand tangible action from the Taliban on their rights.

"We will not give up," said Kabrzani. "We will continue to fight for our future."
