Newsmax Anchor Walks Off Set as My Pillow CEO Spreads False Election Claims

My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell's relentless dissemination of false election fraud claims has led to his suspension from Twitter and an abrupt departure by a Newsmax anchor during a live interview.

Twitter Suspension

Twitter permanently suspended Lindell's personal and corporate accounts for violating its policy against spreading election misinformation. The move follows the suspension of President Trump's account earlier in January after the Capitol riot.

Newsmax Interview

During an interview on Newsmax, Lindell reiterated his baseless claims about the election, prompting anchor Bob Sellers to walk off set. Sellers had repeatedly attempted to halt Lindell's falsehoods, citing a lack of evidence.

"I'm not going to sit here and listen to these lies," Sellers said before leaving the studio.

Newsmax's Position

Newsmax anchor Heather Childers, who remained on set, read aloud the network's position that the election results were legal and final and that they had found no evidence to support fraud allegations.

"We have repeatedly stated that there is no evidence of widespread fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election," Childers said.

Lindell's Persistence

Despite the interruptions and attempts to redirect the conversation, Lindell continued to make his claims, leading Sellers to walk off set.

"I'm not going to be a part of this," Sellers said.

Newsmax's Statement

After the interview, Newsmax issued a statement emphasizing their different viewpoint from Lindell's but acknowledging his right to an opinion.

"Newsmax strongly supports freedom of speech and the right to express one's opinion," said Brian Peterson, Newsmax spokesman. "However, we do not endorse the views expressed by Mike Lindell."

Legal Action

Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic have raised the possibility of legal action against Newsmax for false reporting. Dominion has already filed a $1.3 billion defamation suit against Sidney Powell, a former Trump lawyer, for making baseless claims about the company.

Context

The interview with Lindell was intended to discuss Twitter suspensions and "cancel culture." However, it quickly devolved into a debate about election fraud claims.

Conclusion

Lindell's continued dissemination of false election claims has led to his suspension from Twitter and a walk-off by a Newsmax anchor. Newsmax has distanced itself from Lindell's views, while Dominion and Smartmatic have threatened legal action for false reporting. The incident highlights the ongoing battle against misinformation and the challenges faced by media outlets in balancing freedom of speech with the need for accuracy and accountability.
