Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nationwide Call to Action to Improve Maternal Health

Washington, D.C. - Today, Vice President Kamala Harris announced a nationwide Call to Action to improve maternal health and reduce mortality and morbidity. The Call to Action is a comprehensive effort that includes new investments, policy changes, and partnerships with states, localities, and community organizations.

"Maternal health is a critical issue that affects the health and well-being of women, families, and communities across our nation," said Vice President Harris. "The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to addressing this crisis and ensuring that every woman has access to the quality care she needs before, during, and after pregnancy."

The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations, worsening over the past 20 years, particularly for Black and Native American women. Black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, and Native American women are twice as likely.

Vice President Harris has historically advocated for improved maternal health through legislation like the Maternal CARE Act and the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act.

Call to Action:

The Biden-Harris Administration calls on all stakeholders to join in this effort to improve maternal health. States, localities, community organizations, and healthcare providers are encouraged to take the following actions:

  • Expand Medicaid Postpartum Coverage: States should extend Medicaid coverage to 12 months postpartum.
  • Adopt the "Birthing-Friendly" Hospital Designation: Hospitals should adopt the CMS "Birthing-Friendly" hospital designation to demonstrate their commitment to providing high-quality maternal care.
  • Improve Data Collection: States and healthcare providers should improve data collection on maternal health outcomes to identify and address disparities.
  • Address Social Factors: States and healthcare providers should address social factors that contribute to poor maternal health outcomes, such as poverty, housing instability, and food insecurity.
  • Invest in Workforce Diversity: States and healthcare providers should invest in workforce diversity to ensure that there are enough qualified healthcare professionals to meet the needs of all women.
  • Support Community-Based Organizations: States and healthcare providers should support community-based organizations that provide maternal health services and support.

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to working with all stakeholders to improve maternal health and reduce mortality and morbidity. The Call to Action is a critical step in this effort, and the Administration urges all stakeholders to join in this important work.
