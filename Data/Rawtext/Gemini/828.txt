Dave Ramsey Slams Stimulus Checks as 'Political Rhetoric', Urges Focus on Underlying Issues

Radio host and financial advisor Dave Ramsey has vehemently criticized the proposed second round of stimulus checks, arguing that they are a temporary fix that fails to address the root causes of financial hardship.

"If $600 or $1,400 changes your life, you were already screwed," Ramsey asserted during an appearance on Fox News. "It's not going to fix your life. It's going to make you feel better for a month, and then you're going to be right back where you were."

Ramsey believes that individuals who genuinely need financial assistance have deeper issues related to their careers, debt, relationships, or mental health. He emphasized that stimulus checks are a "Band-Aid" that does not address these underlying problems.

"We've got to stop with this political rhetoric," Ramsey said. "We've got to start talking about what's really going on in people's lives."

Ramsey shared his personal experiences of bankruptcy and financial struggle, highlighting the importance of addressing the root causes of financial hardship. He emphasized his commitment to helping people improve their financial situations but criticized the stimulus as a short-sighted solution.

"I'm not against helping people," Ramsey said. "But I'm against doing it in a way that doesn't fix the problem."

Congress is currently working to pass another round of $1,400 stimulus checks as part of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue package. Biden supports sending $1,400 checks to individuals earning up to $75,000 annually.

The push for more stimulus checks comes as many Americans face financial challenges due to the pandemic. Last week, the Labor Department reported 793,000 new jobless claims, bringing the total number of claims since the pandemic began to around 78 million.

Despite the economic challenges, Ramsey believes that the focus should be on empowering individuals to take control of their finances and address the underlying issues that contribute to financial hardship.

"We've got to stop giving people fish," Ramsey said. "We've got to teach them how to fish."
