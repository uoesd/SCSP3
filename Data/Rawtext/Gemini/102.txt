Speed Trap Towns: Texas Towns Rely Heavily on Traffic Tickets for Revenue

Two small towns in Texas have been identified as having the most aggressive speed traps, using speeding tickets as a significant source of revenue. The Houston Chronicle analyzed traffic stop data from over 2,500 police departments in Texas and found that the top 21 towns for traffic stops in 2020 had more than 500 stops per officer.

Four Central Texas towns made the top 11 list, with two topping it. Bruceville-Eddy is ranked 11th with 684 stops per officer, issuing 1,336 citations in 2020. Buckholts is 10th with 741 stops per officer and 1,341 citations issued.

Lott is in second place with 1,192 stops per officer and 2,475 citations issued. Rosebud topped the list with 1,385 stops per officer but only 1,001 citations in 2020.

These towns rely heavily on traffic tickets for revenue. In Bruceville-Eddy, for example, traffic fines accounted for 62% of the town's total revenue in 2020. In Buckholts, traffic fines accounted for 55% of the town's total revenue.

Critics argue that these towns are using speed traps to generate revenue rather than to promote public safety. They point out that the towns often have low speed limits and that the police officers are often hidden from view.

"It's a money-making scheme," said one driver who was ticketed in Bruceville-Eddy. "They're not interested in safety. They're just interested in making money."

The towns argue that the speed traps are necessary to promote public safety. They point out that the towns have a high number of accidents and that the speed traps have helped to reduce the number of accidents.

"We're not trying to make money," said one police officer in Bruceville-Eddy. "We're trying to make our roads safer."

Drivers who are concerned about getting a speeding ticket in one of these towns can use driving apps like Waze to alert them when they are over the speed limit. These apps can help drivers avoid getting tickets and can also help them to drive more safely.
