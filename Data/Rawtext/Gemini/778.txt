'Rust' Crew Walked Off Set Hours Before Fatal Shooting

Union members working on the set of the Western film "Rust" walked off the set hours before a fatal incident involving actor Alec Baldwin, citing concerns about poor gun safety, according to a text message obtained by The Post.

The text message, sent by a crew member to a unit production manager, stated that the crew was "walking off the show because of poor gun safety." The crew had reportedly raised concerns about the lack of safety protocols on set, including the use of real guns, the lack of a dedicated safety officer, and the overall lack of attention to safety.

The crew reportedly wrote resignation letters citing various safety concerns and lack of payment. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who died in the incident, was among the few who remained on set. Hutchins was reportedly vocal about improving safety conditions before her death.

After the walkout, non-union members were brought in to replace the resigning crew. The prop gun involved in the incident had misfired on multiple occasions prior to the fatal shooting. The prop master who handled the gun was recently hired amid protests over set conditions.

Santa Fe police did not respond to inquiries about the incident.

The incident has raised questions about the safety protocols on film sets and the role of unions in ensuring worker safety. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), which represents crew members on film and television sets, has called for an investigation into the incident.

The fatal shooting on the set of "Rust" is a reminder of the importance of safety on film sets. Crew members must be able to work in a safe environment, and producers must take all necessary steps to ensure their safety.
