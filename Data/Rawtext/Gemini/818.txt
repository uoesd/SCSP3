Stimulus Payments End, Child Tax Credit Changes in 2022

BALTIMORE (WBFF/WKRC) – Stimulus check payments under the American Rescue Plan will end with 2021. Most Americans received $1,400 payments, along with expanded Child Tax Credit benefits. However, no more monthly child tax credit payments are planned for 2022.

The IRS is sending out "plus-up" payments to some families based on changes noted in their 2020 tax filings. These changes include lower income or having a child. "Plus-up" payments are available for individuals making $75,000 or less, or married couples making $150,000 or less. The IRS will continue to send out "plus-up" payments until December 31, based on the legislative deadline.

Democrats plan to continue efforts to extend the Child Tax Credit payments into 2022. A one-year extension of the Child Tax Credit would cost $185 billion. Extending the Child Tax Credit for 10 years would cost $1.6 trillion.

The Child Tax Credit was expanded under the American Rescue Plan, providing monthly payments of up to $300 per child under the age of 6 and $250 per child ages 6 to 17. The payments were intended to help families cover the costs of raising children, such as food, clothing, and childcare.

The expanded Child Tax Credit was a significant benefit for many families, but its future is uncertain. Democrats have proposed extending the credit, but Republicans have opposed the measure. It remains to be seen whether the Child Tax Credit will be extended in 2022.

In the meantime, families should be aware that the monthly Child Tax Credit payments will end with 2021. They should also be aware of the "plus-up" payments that are being sent out by the IRS. These payments are intended to make up for any underpayments that were made in 2021.
