US Capitol Locked Down During Inauguration Rehearsal Amid Security Concerns

The US Capitol complex in Washington, DC, was temporarily locked down on Thursday during a rehearsal for President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. The lockdown was prompted by a fire in a homeless encampment about 1.6 kilometers away from the Capitol, raising security concerns.

Officials stated that there was no threat to the public or the inauguration from the fire. However, the evacuation and lockdown were precautions taken by the acting chief of Capitol Police, Yogananda Pittman.

President-elect Joe Biden was not present at the rehearsal during the lockdown. The lockdown follows heightened security measures due to the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. Security in and around the Capitol has been increased, with the area being on high alert and lockdown.

Participants of the rehearsal, including a military band, were directed to move to a secure location inside the Capitol complex. The US Secret Service announced on Twitter that the lockdown was a precautionary measure, confirming there was no public threat.

"The US Capitol Police is aware of a smoke incident near the Capitol. Out of an abundance of caution, the Capitol has been evacuated and locked down. There is no threat to the public," the Secret Service tweeted.

The fire department extinguished the fire near the Capitol, confirming there were no injuries and explaining the source of the smoke seen.

"The smoke was coming from a fire in a homeless encampment. There were no injuries. The fire has been extinguished," the fire department tweeted.

The lockdown was lifted after about an hour, and the rehearsal resumed. The inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden is scheduled for Wednesday, January 20. Security will remain tight in and around the Capitol until after the inauguration.

The January 6 riot at the US Capitol has raised concerns about the safety of elected officials and the integrity of the democratic process. The lockdown during the inauguration rehearsal is a reminder of the heightened security measures that are in place to protect against any potential threats.
