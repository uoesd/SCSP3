Purple Reigns at Biden-Harris Inauguration, Symbolizing Unity and Progress

At the historic inauguration of President Joseph R. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the color purple took center stage, adorning the attire of prominent figures and conveying a profound message of unity and social values.

"Purple has a long and rich history in American democracy and royalty," said Gwendolyn Dubois Shaw, Senior Historian at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery. "It represents the blending of red and blue, the colors of the Republican and Democratic parties, symbolizing a call for bipartisan harmony."

From Dr. Jill Biden's purple coat to Kamala Harris's vibrant dress, the color purple was a striking presence. Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, Amy Klobuchar, and Mike Pence also embraced the hue, demonstrating its bipartisan appeal.

Beyond its political symbolism, purple also holds historical significance. It is the color of the Purple Heart, honoring military personnel wounded or killed in service. The inauguration's purple theme thus paid tribute to the sacrifices made by those who defend the nation.

Furthermore, the color purple resonates with the historic nature of Harris's inauguration as the first female, first Black, and first South Asian vice president. It parallels the themes of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel "The Color Purple," which explores the struggles and resilience of African American women.

"The choice of purple at the inauguration sends a message beyond fashion," said Shaw. "It symbolizes a commitment to political unity, social justice, and the values that unite us as a nation."

In contrast to the red hats that became a symbol of the previous administration, the purple theme at the Biden-Harris inauguration represents a call for change and a renewed sense of national unity. It is a reminder that even in times of division, the pursuit of common ground and the embrace of shared values can lead to a brighter future for all Americans.
