Cuomo's Brother Allegedly Targeted Fox News Host Over Nursing Home Criticism

Chris Cuomo, the former CNN anchor, reportedly launched personal attacks against Fox News' Janice Dean, who criticized his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's nursing home COVID-19 policy.

Dean, who lost her in-laws to COVID-19 in nursing homes, blamed Andrew Cuomo's policy for their deaths. A source claimed that Chris Cuomo sought advice on how to target Dean by painting her as a "far right crazy."

"I'm not going to get into specifics, but I will say that Chris Cuomo has a history of attacking people who criticize his brother," said a source close to the situation. "He's done it before, and he's doing it again now."

It is alleged that Chris Cuomo participated in discussions on attacking Dean by focusing on her political leanings.

"Chris Cuomo was involved in discussions about how to discredit Janice Dean," said a source. "He wanted to paint her as a right-wing commentator who was not credible."

Rich Azzopardi, spokesman for Andrew Cuomo, claimed he had no knowledge of such actions.

"I have no knowledge of any of these allegations," Azzopardi said. "I can't comment on them."

Reports suggest that Chris Cuomo and Cuomo aide Melissa DeRosa strategized on discrediting Dean as a right-wing commentator.

"Chris Cuomo and Melissa DeRosa worked together to try to discredit Janice Dean," said a source. "They wanted to make her look like a partisan hack who was not credible."

Chris Cuomo was fired from CNN following a new sexual misconduct allegation.
