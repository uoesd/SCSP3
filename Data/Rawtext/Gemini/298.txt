WHO Grants Emergency Use Listing to COVAXIN® for COVID-19 Prevention

Geneva, 3 November 2021 – The World Health Organization (WHO) has granted an Emergency Use Listing (EUL) to COVAXIN®, a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech. This marks the eighth vaccine to receive WHO's EUL for COVID-19.

"This EUL is a testament to the tireless efforts of Bharat Biotech and the scientific community in India," said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. "It is a significant step towards ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for people around the world."

WHO's EUL is a crucial step for COVAX vaccine supply and helps countries expedite their regulatory approval processes. It also allows COVAXIN® to be procured by United Nations agencies and other humanitarian organizations.

The WHO Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) reviewed the vaccine's efficacy, safety, and quality before recommending its EUL.

COVAXIN® is formulated from an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 antigen and is suitable for low- and middle-income countries due to its easy storage requirements. It is administered in two doses, with a dose interval of four weeks, for individuals aged 18 and above.

Clinical trials have shown that COVAXIN® has a 78% efficacy against COVID-19 of any severity, 14 days after the second dose. It is also effective against the Delta variant of the virus.

Over 120,000 pregnant women in India have been vaccinated with COVAXIN® with no short-term adverse effects reported.

"Vaccines are a critical tool in the fight against COVID-19," said Dr Simão. "We must prioritize the vaccination of at-risk groups, including healthcare workers, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions."

The EUL process requires the producing company to continue generating data for full licensure and WHO prequalification. WHO will continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of COVAXIN® and provide updates as necessary.
