BATON ROUGE, La. – The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced today that more than $1.7 billion in federal grants and low-interest loans have been distributed to support Hurricane Ida recovery efforts in Louisiana.

As of November 1, 2021, FEMA has approved over $889 million in grants to individuals and households for housing assistance, other needs assistance, and U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. Additionally, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has paid out $297 million in claims to survivors.

"FEMA is committed to supporting Louisiana's recovery from Hurricane Ida," said FEMA Region 6 Administrator Tony Robinson. "We are working closely with our state and local partners to ensure that survivors have access to the resources they need to rebuild their lives."

Federal housing assistance has provided rental aid to over 179,000 homeowners and renters. Direct Temporary Housing assistance is offered in 10 of the most impacted parishes, providing temporary housing for survivors whose homes were destroyed or severely damaged.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has installed 33,200 "blue roofs" for temporary home roof repairs. FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers have been visited by nearly 33,269 individuals seeking help, and Disaster Survivor Assistance teams have made over 143,544 home visits.
