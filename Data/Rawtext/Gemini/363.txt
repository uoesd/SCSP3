Facebook Removes Disinformation Networks Linked to Hamas, China, and Anti-Vaccine Groups

Facebook has announced the removal of several disinformation networks linked to global actors, including Hamas, Chinese state groups, and anti-vaccine organizations. The takedowns are part of the company's ongoing efforts to combat disinformation, which intensified after the 2016 Russian election interference.

Over the past year, Facebook has targeted hundreds of takedowns involving diverse groups, ranging from political organizations to disinformation-for-hire firms. The company's actions have drawn criticism from some, including a Facebook whistleblower, who accuse the company of neglecting domestic disinformation campaigns, particularly in strategically important countries.

The company's practices relating to the handling of disinformation were highlighted in the "Facebook Papers," a trove of internal documents leaked to the press. The documents revealed a contrast between CEO Mark Zuckerberg's public statements and the company's internal practices.

One of the China-related operations involved a fake account of a Swiss biologist who claimed that the United States was pressuring World Health Organization (WHO) scientists. The account was amplified by Chinese state-controlled media.

Facebook also linked some disinformation efforts about the Belarus-Poland border crisis to the Belarusian KGB, which aimed to criticize Poland's treatment of migrants.

In Gaza, a Hamas-led disinformation campaign was aimed at garnering support for Hamas while criticizing Israel and its political rivals.

Facebook is striving to adapt to evolving tactics by adversarial groups. The company cited crackdowns on anti-vaccination harassment campaigns in Europe as examples of its efforts.

The report underscores the complex battle against disinformation that Facebook is facing. It highlights the global scale of the issue and the central role that the platform plays in the fight against it.

Critics Accuse Facebook of Neglecting Domestic Disinformation

Critics, including Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, have accused the company of neglecting domestic disinformation campaigns, especially in strategically important countries. Haugen testified before Congress in October 2021, alleging that Facebook's algorithms amplify divisive content and that the company has failed to adequately address the spread of misinformation.

Facebook has defended its record on combating disinformation, arguing that it has invested heavily in resources and technology to address the issue. However, the company has acknowledged that it faces challenges in detecting and removing all forms of disinformation, particularly when it is spread by sophisticated actors.

Facebook Papers Reveal Contrast Between Zuckerberg's Public Statements and Internal Practices

The "Facebook Papers," a trove of internal documents leaked to the press, revealed a contrast between CEO Mark Zuckerberg's public statements and the company's internal practices. The documents showed that Zuckerberg was aware of the platform's role in spreading disinformation but that he downplayed the issue in public.

The documents also showed that Facebook has been slow to address the issue of disinformation, despite repeated warnings from its own employees.

Facebook Strives to Adapt to Evolving Tactics

Facebook is striving to adapt to evolving tactics by adversarial groups. The company cited crackdowns on anti-vaccination harassment campaigns in Europe as examples of its efforts.

Facebook has also developed new tools to detect and remove disinformation, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. The company is also working with third-party fact-checkers to identify and debunk false information.
