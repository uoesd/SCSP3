First Lady and Vice President Make History with Symbolic Fashion Choices

In a display of unity and symbolism, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris made powerful fashion statements during President Biden's first address to Congress.

Dr. Biden chose to wear an upcycled, navy version of her white inauguration dress, designed by Gabriela Hearst. The dress featured federal flowers from every state and territory, including the District of Columbia.

"It was an honor to create this dress for Dr. Biden," said Hearst. "The upcycled fabric and the inclusion of flowers from all over the country represent sustainability and unity."

Vice President Harris opted for a cream-colored Prabal Gurung suit and satin camisole, symbolizing a choice of "light over darkness."

"I am deeply honored that Vice President Harris chose to wear my design," said Gurung. "Her choice sends a powerful message about representation and the importance of women in leadership."

Harris also wore a Prabal Gurung outfit for her first day in office at the Inaugural prayer service.

The significance of the women seated behind President Biden during his speech was not lost on Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

"For the first time in history, we have two women, Vice President Harris and myself, standing behind the President of the United States," said Pelosi. "This is a historic moment for our country."

Democratic women in Congress echoed Pelosi's sentiments.

"The presence of women behind President Biden during his speech is a powerful reminder of the progress we have made," said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. "It is also a reminder of the work that still needs to be done."

Vice President Harris's election marks a historic milestone as the first woman, first Black person, and first person of Asian descent to hold the office.

"I am proud to be a part of this moment," said Harris. "I hope that my presence in this role will inspire young people, especially young women, to dream big and to know that anything is possible."

The fashion choices of Dr. Biden and Vice President Harris were not only stylish but also symbolic of the values and aspirations of the Biden administration. Their outfits represented unity, sustainability, representation, and the power of women in leadership.
