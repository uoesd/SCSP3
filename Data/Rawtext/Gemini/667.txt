Rittenhouse Reflects on Kenosha Shootings, Expresses Regrets

Kyle Rittenhouse, acquitted last month of all charges related to the fatal shootings of two men and the wounding of another during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has expressed regrets about his decision to go to the city that night.

In an interview on the podcast "You Are Here," hosted by BlazeTV, Rittenhouse said, "I don't know if it was the best idea to go down there." However, he emphasized that despite his regrets, he defended himself during the events in Kenosha.

"I was there to help people, and I did," Rittenhouse said. "I defended myself, and I'm not going to apologize for that."

Rittenhouse's defense argued that the shootings were in self-defense and that he aimed to provide medical care and protect businesses. Prosecutors contended that Rittenhouse escalated the situation by arming himself with an AR-15 style weapon.

Co-host Sydney Watson made controversial remarks about the shootings, saying that Rittenhouse "did nothing wrong" and that he "should be celebrated." Rittenhouse distanced himself from Watson's comments, saying, "I don't celebrate violence."

The families of the victims expressed their dismay at the verdict, highlighting a lack of accountability. Jacob Blake, whose shooting by police sparked the protests in Kenosha, said, "I'm not surprised by the verdict, but I'm still disappointed."

Rittenhouse mentioned suffering from PTSD but tries to cope through humor, discussing trial memes. "I've been trying to cope with it through humor," he said. "I've been looking at a lot of memes about the trial."

He denied being a hero, insisting he only defended himself. "I'm not a hero," Rittenhouse said. "I'm just a kid who was trying to do the right thing."

Rittenhouse's acquittal has sparked a national debate about self-defense, gun rights, and the role of vigilantism in society. The case has also highlighted the deep divisions in American society over race, justice, and the use of force.
