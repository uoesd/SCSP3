US Cyber Command Launches Offensive Strikes Against Ransomware Groups

CNN – The US military's hacking unit, Cyber Command, has taken offensive action to disrupt ransomware attacks targeting American companies, marking a significant shift in the government's approach to combating cybercrime.

"We have conducted a surge of operations against ransomware actors, targeting their infrastructure, their command and control, their ability to move money," said Gen. Paul Nakasone, head of Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency.

The specific actions taken by Cyber Command were not disclosed, but the move represents one of the first clear acknowledgments of targeting cybercriminal groups since the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May.

Nakasone indicated a shift towards hacking criminal groups, not just state actors. "We are not just going after the nation-state actors. We are going after the criminal actors," he said.

US security agencies have increased efforts against ransomware groups following significant attacks on the Colonial Pipeline and a major meat processor.

"We have taken down their infrastructure. We have taken down their ability to move money. We have taken down their ability to communicate," Nakasone said.

The US government's counteroffensive also includes indicting extortionists and sanctioning a cryptocurrency exchange for laundering money for hackers.

The White House is pushing the Russian government to act against cybercriminals based in Russia. President Biden is set to discuss cybersecurity in an upcoming video call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The focus on cybersecurity follows Biden urging Putin to tackle hacker activities during a meeting in Geneva six months ago.

"We have been clear with the Russians that they need to take action against these criminal actors," said a senior administration official.

The offensive actions by Cyber Command and the broader US government response signal a new era of aggressive cyber operations aimed at disrupting and dismantling ransomware groups.
