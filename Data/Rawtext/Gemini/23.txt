Federal Prisons Locked Down Ahead of Biden Inauguration

NEW YORK (AP) – All federal prisons in the United States have been placed on lockdown ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, affecting more than 120 Bureau of Prisons facilities and over 150,000 inmates.

The lockdown, which began at 12 a.m. Saturday, was implemented as a precautionary measure in light of recent events around the country, including the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol.

"We are taking this action out of an abundance of caution to ensure the safety and security of our staff and inmates," said Justin Long, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons. "There have been no specific incidents within our facilities that prompted this lockdown."

The lockdown was not announced to inmates until after they were already secured in their cells. They will have limited access to showers, phones, and email, but will be able to participate in basic activities such as reading, writing, and watching television.

"This is a very difficult time for our members," said Shane Fausey, president of the Council of Prison Locals, which represents over 30,000 federal prison employees. "They are working long hours under stressful conditions, and they are concerned about their safety and the safety of their families."

This is the second nationwide lockdown in federal prisons in recent months. The first lockdown was implemented in April due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"We are still dealing with the challenges of the pandemic," said Aaron McGlothin, local union president at a federal prison in California. "This lockdown is just another layer of stress for our members."

In addition to the lockdown, the Bureau of Prisons is also relocating Special Operations Response Teams to Washington, D.C., to strengthen security for the inauguration.

"We are working closely with the Justice Department to ensure that we have the resources we need to respond to any potential threats," Long said.

The Bureau of Prisons is also investigating a potential case of tuberculosis at a federal lockup in Mendota, California. The inmate who is suspected of having tuberculosis has been isolated, and the facility is being cleaned and disinfected.

"We are taking all necessary precautions to prevent the spread of tuberculosis," Long said. "The health and safety of our staff and inmates is our top priority."
