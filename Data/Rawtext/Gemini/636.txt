Rittenhouse Gun Possession Charge Dismissed, Highlighting Ambiguity in Wisconsin Law

MADISON, Wis. (AP) – A Wisconsin judge has dismissed a gun possession charge against Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted of killing two men during a protest in Kenosha.

Judge Bruce Schroeder granted the dismissal on Tuesday, ruling that Rittenhouse's AR-15-style rifle did not meet the definition of a short-barreled weapon, which is illegal for minors to possess in Wisconsin.

"The court finds that the State has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed a dangerous weapon," Schroeder said.

Rittenhouse was 17 at the time of the shootings and faced five felony charges, including murder. He was found not guilty of all charges in November after a highly publicized trial that drew national attention.

The gun possession charge, a misdemeanor, was seen as a potential compromise for jurors who believed in Rittenhouse's self-defense claim but also criticized his decision to carry a rifle.

Defense attorneys pointed to a legal exception that allows minors to possess shotguns and rifles if they're not short-barreled.

"The statute is clear that a minor can possess a long gun," said Mark Richards, one of Rittenhouse's attorneys.

Corey Chirafisi, another defense attorney, argued that the exception was intended to allow minors to hunt.

"This is a hunting exception," Chirafisi said. "It's not an exception for carrying a gun in public."

Assistant District Attorney James Kraus argued that the exception did not apply to Rittenhouse because he was not hunting at the time of the shootings.

"The defendant was not engaged in lawful hunting activity," Kraus said.

The dismissal of the gun possession charge highlights the ambiguity in Wisconsin law concerning minors possessing firearms.

"The law is not clear on this issue," said Michael Cicchini, a defense attorney. "It's up to the courts to interpret the law, and the courts have interpreted it in different ways."

Wisconsin law on minors possessing firearms has evolved over time. In 1993, the legislature expanded the prohibition on minors possessing firearms to include shotguns and rifles. However, the legislature also created an exception for minors who are hunting or target shooting under the supervision of an adult.

In 2011, the legislature refined the exception to allow minors to possess shotguns and rifles for hunting purposes only. However, the law still allows minors to possess long guns for target shooting under the supervision of an adult.

Critics argue that the law's ambiguity concerning long guns for minors is problematic.

"The law is not clear, and that's a problem," said Jeri Bonavia, executive director of the Wisconsin Anti-Violence Effort. "It's up to the courts to interpret the law, and the courts have interpreted it in different ways."

Tom Grieve, a Milwaukee attorney and former prosecutor, said the law's complexity and ambiguity necessitate its interpretation in favor of defendants.

"The law is not clear, and that's why the court dismissed the charge," Grieve said. "The court has to interpret the law in a way that prevents potential abuse by the government."

There is debate over the intention behind the exception for long guns. Some suggest it was meant for hunting, not for carrying in public spaces like protests.

"The exception was intended to allow minors to hunt," said Democrat Jon Erpenbach, a state Senate member. "It was not intended to allow minors to carry guns in public."

The dismissal of the gun possession charge against Rittenhouse is likely to reignite the debate over Wisconsin's laws concerning minors possessing firearms.

"This case has highlighted the need for clarity in the law," said Cicchini. "The legislature needs to take a look at the law and make sure it's clear."

Until the law is clarified, the courts will continue to interpret it on a case-by-case basis.

"The law is not clear, and that's why the court dismissed the charge," said Grieve. "The court has to interpret the law in a way that prevents potential abuse by the government."
