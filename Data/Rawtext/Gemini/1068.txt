Missing Long Island Woman Last Seen in Wyoming

BLUE POINT, Long Island (WABC) – A 22-year-old Long Island woman is missing while traveling in Wyoming, and her family is desperately seeking answers.

Gabrielle Petito, from Blue Point, was last seen in Grand Teton National Park on August 25. She was traveling with her boyfriend in a white 2012 Ford Transit van.

"I'm just very concerned and very worried," said Petito's mother, Nicole Schmidt. "I just want to know where she is and that she's safe."

Petito and her boyfriend were documenting their cross-country trip on YouTube, with plans to arrive in Portland, Oregon, in October. The last communication from Petito was a text message received by her mother on August 30.

"It was just a normal text," Schmidt said. "She was talking about how she was excited to go to Yellowstone."

Petito was reported missing to the Suffolk County Police Department on September 11. Her boyfriend is not missing, and their van was recovered in Florida.

"We are actively assisting in the investigation," said the North Port Police Department in Florida. "We are working with local police and the FBI Tampa Field Office."

Petito is described as a white female, approximately 5-foot-5 and 110 pounds, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and several tattoos. She has a tattoo on her forearm that says "Let it be," a tattoo on her finger that says "Moon," and a tattoo on her rib cage that says "Wanderlust."

"We are urging the public to contact Crime Stoppers or the North Port Police Department with any information," said the North Port Police Department. "No matter how small or insignificant you think it may be, it could be crucial to the investigation."

Petito's family and friends are holding out hope that she will be found safe and sound.

"She's a beautiful soul," Schmidt said. "She's always smiling, always happy. She's just a joy to be around."

Anyone with information about Petito's whereabouts is urged to contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-220-TIPS or the North Port Police Department at 941-429-7300.
