Biden Administration Unveils Plan to Combat White Supremacist and Militia Violence

June 15 – The Biden administration announced a comprehensive plan on Wednesday to combat the growing threat of white supremacist and militia violence, labeling these groups as top national security threats.

"We are facing a heightened threat from domestic violent extremists, including those motivated by racial or ethnic hatred," said a senior administration official. "This plan will enhance our ability to identify, disrupt, and prosecute these threats."

The strategy, developed following a domestic terrorism review, does not propose new laws but aims to use existing authority more effectively. It includes increased information sharing among law enforcement agencies, additional resources for identifying and prosecuting threats, and new deterrents against joining dangerous groups.

"We must use every tool at our disposal to prevent these violent extremists from harming our communities," said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. "This plan will help us do just that."

The FBI has identified racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, particularly those advocating for white supremacy, as the top domestic violent extremist threat. The administration's plan seeks to address this threat by:

  • Reinforcing an interagency task force to combat domestic terrorism, led by the Department of Justice.
  • Providing $100 million in Biden's budget proposal to train and hire analysts and prosecutors to counteract terrorist activity.
  • Improving screening methods to identify employees who may pose insider threats, with techniques to be shared with private companies.
  • Reviewing how to remove military members engaged in domestic terrorist groups, focusing on defining extremists while respecting rights.

"We need to ensure that our law enforcement and intelligence communities have the resources and personnel they need to address this elevated threat," said the senior administration official. "This plan will help us do that."

The administration's plan emphasizes the need for collaboration between federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, as well as community organizations and the private sector. It also calls for increased public awareness and education about the threat of domestic terrorism.

"We must work together to counter this threat and protect our communities," said Garland. "This plan is an important step in that effort."
