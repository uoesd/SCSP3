Facebook, YouTube Remove Bolsonaro's COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation Video

RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 25 – Facebook and YouTube have removed a video posted by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro that falsely claimed COVID-19 vaccines were linked to AIDS.

The video was taken down for violating the platforms' policies against COVID-19 disinformation.

"We remove content that violates our policies, including claims that COVID-19 vaccines kill or seriously harm people," a Facebook spokesperson said.

YouTube removed the video for allegations that vaccines don't reduce the risk of contracting the disease and cause other infectious diseases.

"Our policies prohibit content that alleges that vaccines are ineffective or dangerous," a YouTube spokesperson said.

The United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has stated that COVID-19 vaccines are safe, including for those living with HIV.

Bolsonaro's office has not responded to requests for comment.

This is not the first time YouTube has removed Bolsonaro's videos promoting ineffective COVID-19 treatments. The platform previously took down videos where he promoted hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.

Bolsonaro has credited hydroxychloroquine for his mild COVID-19 symptoms but initially refused to take any COVID-19 vaccine.

According to reports, YouTube has suspended Bolsonaro for seven days following the video's removal.

Both Facebook and YouTube have declined to provide further comments on the suspension.

Bolsonaro's claims about COVID-19 vaccines have been repeatedly debunked by health experts. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death.

Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence, Bolsonaro has continued to make false claims about vaccines, which has contributed to vaccine hesitancy in Brazil.

The removal of Bolsonaro's video by Facebook and YouTube is a significant step in combating the spread of COVID-19 disinformation. It sends a clear message that false and misleading claims about vaccines will not be tolerated on these platforms.
