Cuomo's Former Producer Alleges Groping, Raises Concerns About CNN Culture

In the wake of Chris Cuomo's departure from CNN, a former executive producer for his show has come forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior, casting a new light on the culture at the network.

Melanie Buck, who led Cuomo Prime Time to the number one spot at CNN, has revealed that she felt threatened and requested to be transferred after significant differences with Cuomo. Her departure, along with the recent allegations of sexual misconduct by another former executive producer, Shelley Ross, has raised questions about the work environment at CNN and the network's handling of such allegations.

Buck, who is now working on CNN+, declined to provide specific details about her conflicts with Cuomo, citing a non-disclosure agreement. However, she stated that she felt "threatened" and "uncomfortable" working with him.

Ross, in an op-ed published in The New York Times, accused Cuomo of groping her at a party in 2005. Cuomo acknowledged the interaction but emphasized that it was not sexual in nature and that he had apologized at the time.

Ross, however, criticized Cuomo's response to her op-ed, saying it lacked "enlightenment" and "understanding." She pointed out that Cuomo had compared his actions to those of actor Christian Slater, who had been accused of sexual assault.

"I was deeply disappointed by Chris Cuomo's response to my op-ed," Ross wrote. "His apology seemed intended to provide him with legal and moral coverage rather than genuine remorse."

The incident and Cuomo's apology resurfaced amid scrutiny of his handling of his brother's sexual harassment scandal. Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York, resigned in August 2021 after an investigation found that he had sexually harassed multiple women.

Chris Cuomo has not publicly addressed Ross's allegations on his CNN show. However, he has previously denied any wrongdoing in his brother's case.

Ross said she did not want Cuomo to be fired but urged him to "journalistically repent" for his actions.

"I believe that Chris Cuomo should not be fired," Ross wrote. "But I do believe that he needs to take responsibility for his actions and apologize to me and to the other women who have accused him of misconduct."

CNN has declined to comment on Ross's allegations. However, the network has previously stated that it takes all allegations of sexual misconduct seriously and that it is committed to providing a safe and respectful work environment for all employees.

The allegations against Cuomo and the subsequent fallout have raised questions about the culture at CNN and the network's handling of such allegations. Some critics have accused CNN of protecting Cuomo and failing to adequately address the concerns raised by Buck and Ross.

Others have defended CNN, saying that the network has taken appropriate action in response to the allegations. They point to the fact that Cuomo has been suspended and that CNN has launched an internal investigation into the matter.

The allegations against Cuomo and the subsequent fallout have also sparked a broader conversation about the culture of sexual harassment in the media industry. Some critics have accused the industry of being too tolerant of such behavior and of failing to hold powerful figures accountable.

Others have argued that the industry is making progress in addressing sexual harassment and that the recent allegations against Cuomo are a sign that such behavior is no longer tolerated.

The allegations against Cuomo and the subsequent fallout are likely to continue to be a source of debate and discussion in the media industry. The outcome of CNN's internal investigation and Cuomo's future with the network remain uncertain.
