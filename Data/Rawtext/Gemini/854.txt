Tiger Woods' Rolling Hills Estates Crash: Speed and Curve to Blame

Rolling Hills Estates, Calif. - Golf legend Tiger Woods was involved in a serious car crash in Rolling Hills Estates earlier this year, which left him with a broken leg. Los Angeles County sheriff's officials have determined that the crash was caused by Woods driving at nearly twice the speed limit and failing to handle a curve.

The crash occurred on a notorious stretch of Hawthorne Boulevard known for bad accidents. Woods' vehicle hit a median, crossed into an opposing lane, hit a tree, and then rolled over. Data from the vehicle's black box showed Woods was traveling 75 mph upon hitting the tree.

"The primary causal factor for this traffic collision was driving at a speed unsafe for the road conditions and the inability to negotiate the curve of the roadway," said Capt. James Powers of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

Woods did not hit the brakes before the collision, possibly hitting the accelerator inadvertently, and does not recall the crash. He was trapped in the vehicle until rescued by firefighters and paramedics.

"It's very fortunate that Mr. Woods was able to come out of this alive," said Sheriff Alex Villanueva. "This is an accident that could have easily been fatal."

Villanueva stated that Woods showed no signs of impairment and was not charged with a crime or cited for an infraction.

Woods was in Los Angeles County for a two-day video shoot and was driving a courtesy vehicle at the time of the crash.

In a statement, Woods acknowledged the sheriff's investigation and thanked the responders.

"I am deeply grateful to the Good Samaritans, the law enforcement officers, the firefighters and paramedics, the doctors, nurses and staff at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, and the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for their heroic efforts in getting me out of the wreck and getting me the care I needed," Woods said. "I am also grateful to the many people who have supported me during this difficult time."

Woods is currently recovering from his injuries and has not provided a timeline for his return to golf.

The Crash Scene

The crash occurred on a downhill stretch of Hawthorne Boulevard near the intersection of Blackhorse Road. The road is known for its curves and has been the site of numerous accidents in recent years.

"This is a very dangerous stretch of road," said Powers. "We have had a number of serious accidents here in the past."

The crash occurred at approximately 7:12 a.m. on February 23. Woods was driving a 2021 Genesis GV80 SUV when he lost control of the vehicle. The SUV hit a median, crossed into an opposing lane, hit a tree, and then rolled over.

Woods was the only person in the vehicle. He was wearing a seatbelt and was able to get out of the SUV on his own. However, he was seriously injured and was taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center by ambulance.

The Investigation

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department conducted an investigation into the crash. The investigation included interviews with witnesses, an examination of the crash scene, and an analysis of the vehicle's black box data.

The investigation found that Woods was driving at 75 mph upon hitting the tree. The speed limit on the stretch of Hawthorne Boulevard where the crash occurred is 45 mph.

The investigation also found that Woods did not hit the brakes before the collision. This suggests that he may have hit the accelerator inadvertently.

Woods has not commented on the investigation's findings. However, he has said that he does not recall the crash.

The Aftermath

Woods was released from the hospital on February 28. He is currently recovering from his injuries at his home in Florida.

Woods has not provided a timeline for his return to golf. However, he has said that he is determined to make a full recovery.

"I am so grateful to be alive," Woods said. "I am going to take the time I need to recover and I am determined to come back stronger than ever."

The Roadway

The stretch of Hawthorne Boulevard where the crash occurred is known for its curves and has been the site of numerous accidents in recent years.

In 2018, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works conducted a study of the road. The study found that the road is "a high-crash corridor."

The study recommended a number of safety improvements to the road, including adding rumble strips, widening the shoulders, and installing guardrails.

However, the county has not yet implemented these recommendations.

Conclusion

The crash that injured Tiger Woods was a serious reminder of the dangers of speeding and driving on dangerous roads. The crash also highlighted the need for safety improvements on Hawthorne Boulevard.
