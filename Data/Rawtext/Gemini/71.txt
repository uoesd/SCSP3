Trump's False Narrative: 'Hugging and Kissing' Police During Capitol Riot

Washington CNN – Former President Donald Trump has once again attempted to rewrite the history of the January 6 Capitol riot, falsely claiming that his supporters were "hugging and kissing" police officers during the insurrection.

Trump's comments, made during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, are a blatant attempt to whitewash the violence that unfolded that day, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

"They were hugging and kissing the police and the guards," Trump said. "They had great relationships. A lot of the people were waved in."

These claims are contradicted by numerous videos and eyewitness accounts that show rioters violently attacking police officers, breaking windows, and storming the Capitol building in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's win in the 2020 election.

Over 100 police officers were injured and five people died as a result of the riot. Criminal complaints against riot participants detail the severity of the threats against lawmakers, including threats to hang Vice President Mike Pence.

Trump's "hugging and kissing" remark may refer to limited interactions between some rioters and police officers, but it ignores the overall violence and chaos that characterized the event.

"It was a lovefest," Trump claimed. "They were hugging and kissing the police and the guards. They had great relationships."

Trump also criticized the beefed-up security at the US Capitol as "disgraceful" and a "political maneuver." He suggested that some rioters should face repercussions but quickly attacked Antifa, drawing a false equivalency.

"I think they should be prosecuted," Trump said of the rioters. "But Antifa is a far greater problem than these people."

Ingraham asked Trump if people who commit crimes should be prosecuted, to which he agreed.

"If they committed crimes, they should be prosecuted," Trump said.

Trump has been accused in lawsuits by Democratic lawmakers of stoking the riot with his repeated false claims that the election was stolen from him. He denies responsibility for the violence.

"I didn't do anything wrong," Trump said. "I'm not responsible for what happened."

The January 6 riot was a dark day for American democracy. Trump's attempts to downplay the violence and rewrite the history of that day are a dangerous and irresponsible distortion of the truth.
