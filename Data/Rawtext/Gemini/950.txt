Swalwell Sues Trump, Allies Over Jan. 6 Capitol Riot

WASHINGTON (AP) – Rep. Eric Swalwell filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Donald Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani, and Rep. Mo Brooks for their roles in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, alleges a conspiracy to violate civil rights, negligence, inciting a riot, and inflicting emotional distress. Swalwell charges the defendants with making baseless claims of election fraud and inciting violence that led to the Capitol storming.

"The defendants conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and to prevent the peaceful transfer of power," the lawsuit states. "They did so by spreading false and defamatory claims about the election, by inciting violence, and by encouraging others to join them in their efforts to overturn the election results."

The lawsuit details Trump and his allies' spread of false election fraud claims before and after the 2020 election. It cites Trump's repeated claims that the election was "stolen" and his urging of supporters to "fight like hell" to overturn the results.

Five people died as a result of the violence, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer.

Trump's spokesman, Jason Miller, dismissed the lawsuit as "meritless" and a "witch hunt."

"This is nothing more than a political stunt by a desperate politician who is trying to stay relevant," Miller said in a statement.

Rep. Brooks also dismissed the lawsuit, calling it "frivolous" and "baseless."

"This is a clear attempt to intimidate and silence those who are speaking out against the rigged 2020 election," Brooks said in a statement.

The lawsuit uses Trump's own words to accuse him of inciting the riot, similar to arguments in Trump's impeachment trial. It cites Trump's speech on Jan. 6, in which he told supporters to "fight like hell" and march to the Capitol.

"Trump's words were not protected by the First Amendment," the lawsuit states. "They were intended to incite violence, and they did so."

Both Swalwell's and a similar lawsuit by Rep. Bennie Thompson cite a federal civil rights law to counter officials' intimidation. The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 allows victims of conspiracies to violate civil rights to sue for damages.

Swalwell recounts being trapped in the House chamber during the attack, fearing for his life. He says he heard rioters chanting "Hang Mike Pence" and "Kill Nancy Pelosi."

"I was terrified for my life," Swalwell said in a statement. "I thought I was going to die."

Swalwell seeks unspecified damages and wants defendants to notify him of large rallies in Washington in advance.

"The defendants must be held accountable for their actions," Swalwell said. "They must be stopped from inciting violence and from trying to overturn the results of free and fair elections."

The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal challenges to Trump and his allies over the Jan. 6 riot. The House of Representatives impeached Trump for inciting an insurrection, but the Senate acquitted him.

The Justice Department is also investigating the riot and has charged hundreds of people with crimes.

The lawsuit is likely to face significant legal challenges. The defendants are likely to argue that their speech is protected by the First Amendment and that they did not incite violence.

However, the lawsuit could also put pressure on Trump and his allies to account for their actions on Jan. 6.
