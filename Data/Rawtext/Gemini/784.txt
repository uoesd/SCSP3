Stimulus Checks Extended to Non-Citizens Under American Rescue Plan

President Joe Biden has signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, authorizing a third round of stimulus checks and expanding eligibility to non-citizens who pay taxes as residents in the United States and hold a valid Social Security number.

Eligibility for Non-Citizens

The American Rescue Plan includes mixed immigration status families for stimulus checks, a change from the CARES Act policy. Eligible non-citizens include:

  • Lawful permanent residents (green card holders)
  • Qualifying resident aliens (individuals with a valid Social Security number who have met the substantial presence test)
  • DACA participants
  • TPS individuals
  • H1-B visa holders with Social Security numbers

Ineligibility for Non-Citizens

Undocumented immigrants and those filing taxes with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) are not eligible for the payment. Additionally, nonresident aliens, foreign government-related individuals, teachers/trainees, foreign students, and professional athletes typically do not qualify.

Eligibility for U.S. Citizens Abroad

U.S. citizens living abroad are also eligible for a stimulus check provided they meet certain criteria:

  • They must have a valid Social Security number
  • They must have filed a U.S. tax return in 2019 or 2020
  • They must meet the income eligibility requirements

Payment Details

Eligible recipients abroad will receive payments via direct deposit or paper check based on the information on file with the IRS. The IRS will use the address on the most recent tax return filed.

Recovery Rebate Credit

Individuals who didn't receive the first two stimulus checks can claim them through the Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 taxes. The credit is available to eligible individuals who meet the income requirements and have not yet received the full amount of the stimulus payments.

Additional Provisions

The American Rescue Plan also includes several other provisions related to immigration, such as:

  • Expanding access to healthcare for undocumented immigrants
  • Providing funding for citizenship classes
  • Creating a pathway to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants

Impact on the Economy

The American Rescue Plan is expected to have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. The stimulus checks are designed to provide immediate financial relief to individuals and families struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan also includes funding for vaccine distribution, testing, and tracing, which is expected to help accelerate the economic recovery.

Conclusion

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 represents a significant expansion of the U.S. government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The inclusion of non-citizens in the stimulus check program is a recognition of the contributions that immigrants make to the U.S. economy and society. The plan is expected to provide much-needed financial relief to individuals and families, and to help accelerate the economic recovery.
