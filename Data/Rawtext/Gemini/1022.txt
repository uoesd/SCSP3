Cruz Admits Mexico Trip Was a Mistake Amid Texas Winter Storm

DALLAS (AP) – Texas Senator Ted Cruz acknowledged that his family vacation to Mexico during a deadly winter storm was a mistake, facing criticism from both parties for traveling as Texans suffered from power outages.

Cruz initially flew to Cancun with his family because his daughters asked to go, intending to stay through the weekend. However, he returned to Texas early, citing the need to focus on the state's crisis.

"It was obviously a mistake, and in hindsight, I wouldn't have done it," Cruz told reporters upon his return. "I was trying to be a good dad and take care of my family, but I understand that my actions were seen as insensitive, and I apologize for that."

The controversy has cast a shadow over Cruz's political future, including his potential 2024 presidential run. Texas GOP Chair Allen West did not defend Cruz, emphasizing the need to help those affected by the storm.

"Our focus should be on the people of Texas who are still suffering from the effects of this winter storm," West said. "We need to come together as a state and support each other during this difficult time."

Over 7 million Texans were advised to boil water before drinking due to infrastructure damage from the storm. Cruz's absence and the government's overall response were criticized by Texas residents and politicians.

"It's unacceptable that Senator Cruz would abandon his constituents during a time of crisis," said Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa. "He needs to resign immediately."

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration was "focused on providing assistance to the people of Texas" and declined to comment on Cruz's actions.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) tweeted that Cruz's trip was "a dereliction of duty" and called for his resignation.

Cruz's office contacted the Houston Police Department about his return, but it's unclear if this was a typical procedure.

"We received a call from Senator Cruz's office requesting assistance with his return to Houston," said Jodi Silva, a spokesperson for the Houston Police Department. "We provided an escort to ensure his safe passage."

Cruz's actions have drawn comparisons to former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, who was criticized for leaving the city during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Nagin was later convicted of corruption charges.

"Cruz's trip to Cancun is a reminder that some politicians care more about their own comfort than the well-being of their constituents," said political analyst Mark Jones. "It's a stain on his reputation that will be difficult to erase."

Cruz's apology and early return to Texas may help mitigate the damage, but the controversy is likely to continue to dog him in the coming weeks and months.
