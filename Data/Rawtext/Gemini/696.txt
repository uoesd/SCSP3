Massie's Christmas Gun Photo Sparks Outrage After School Shooting

WASHINGTON, Dec 4 – U.S. Congressman Thomas Massie (R-KY) has drawn criticism for posting a Christmas picture featuring himself and his family holding an array of guns, days after a school shooting in Michigan resulted in the deaths of four teenagers.

The tweet, posted on December 3, shows Massie, his wife, and their four children holding firearms, including an M60 machine gun, an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, and a Thompson submachine gun. The caption reads, "Merry Christmas! ps. Santa, please bring ammo."

The post has sparked outrage, particularly in light of the recent school shooting in Oxford, Michigan, where 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley allegedly killed four students and injured seven others. Crumbley's parents have also been arrested in connection with the shooting.

Democratic U.S. Representative John Yarmuth (D-KY), Chair of the U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee, criticized Massie's post as insensitive. "This is not a joke," Yarmuth tweeted. "This is a tragedy. And it's time for us to do something about gun violence."

Yarmuth's reaction highlights the ongoing tensions over gun control and gun rights debates in the United States. Massie represents a solidly Republican district in Kentucky, where gun ownership is prevalent.

Jonathan van Norman, Massie's campaign manager, did not respond to requests for comment.

The firearms in the photo include semi-automatic versions of weapons that are typically restricted to military and law enforcement or specially licensed civilians. The M60 machine gun is a belt-fed weapon capable of firing hundreds of rounds per minute. The AR-15 semi-automatic rifle is a popular choice for civilian use, but has also been used in numerous mass shootings. The Thompson submachine gun is a classic weapon that was widely used by law enforcement and military forces in the early 20th century.

Massie's post has sparked a heated debate on social media, with some users defending his right to own guns and others condemning his insensitivity. The incident has also reignited calls for stricter gun control measures, including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

The school shooting in Michigan has brought the issue of gun violence back into the national spotlight. President Joe Biden has called for Congress to pass legislation to address the problem, including universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons.

However, Republicans have largely opposed such measures, arguing that they infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. The debate is likely to continue in the coming weeks and months, as lawmakers grapple with the complex issue of gun violence in the United States.
