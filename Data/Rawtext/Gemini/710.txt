Memorial High School Note, La Follette Student Arrest Raise Concerns

MADISON, Wis. – A note referencing the Oxford High School shooting was discovered at Memorial High School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Wednesday afternoon, prompting an investigation and assurances from school officials that there is no security or safety risk.

The note was found on a bathroom floor and reported to Principal Matt Hendrickson, who immediately notified the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD).

"We take all threats seriously and are working closely with the Madison Police Department and the Central Office of School Safety to investigate this matter," Hendrickson said in a statement. "We want to assure our school community that there is no current safety or security risk."

The investigation is ongoing, and the school community is encouraged to share any concerning information with school officials or law enforcement.

On the same day, an 18-year-old student at La Follette High School in Madison was arrested for having a loaded gun inside the school. The student, identified as Marquan T. Webb, is facing several charges, including possession of a stolen firearm.

The loaded gun found with Webb had been reported stolen out of Cottage Grove in September. There were no injuries reported related to the discovery of the note or the arrest of Webb.

The incidents at Memorial and La Follette High Schools come amid a trend of copycat threats following the Oxford High School shooting, which left four students dead and seven injured on November 30. The threats have led to class cancellations in over a dozen Detroit school districts.

"We understand that these incidents can be unsettling for our students and families," Hendrickson said. "We want to emphasize that we are committed to providing a safe and supportive learning environment for all."

MMSD Superintendent Carlton Jenkins echoed Hendrickson's sentiments, stating that the district is working with law enforcement to address the threats and ensure the safety of students and staff.

"We encourage our school communities to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity or concerns to school officials or law enforcement," Jenkins said. "Together, we can create a safe and welcoming environment for all."

The investigation into the note at Memorial High School is ongoing, and the school district is cooperating with law enforcement. The district has also implemented additional security measures, including increased police presence and random searches.

The arrest of Webb at La Follette High School is also under investigation. The student is currently in custody, and the school district is working with law enforcement to determine how the gun was brought into the school.

The incidents at Memorial and La Follette High Schools serve as a reminder of the importance of school safety and the need for vigilance in reporting suspicious activity. The school district and law enforcement are committed to working together to ensure the safety of students and staff.
