Santorum Backtracks on Native American Culture Comments, Faces Skepticism

Former Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Rick Santorum has walked back comments he made last month about Native American culture in the United States.

In April, Santorum claimed during a speech at a conservative youth organization that there isn't much Native American culture in American culture. His remarks were widely criticized.

On CNN's "Cuomo Prime Time," host Chris Cuomo invited Santorum to explain his comments. Santorum said he misspoke and was referring to the founding of the country and its principles.

"I was talking about the founding of the country and the principles that were enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution," Santorum said. "And I said that those principles were not derived from Native American culture."

He acknowledged that Native Americans were here and had an impact on the country. "They were here before us, and they had a culture and a way of life," Santorum said.

Santorum also admitted that the way Native Americans were treated was "horrific." "The way we treated Native Americans was horrific," he said. "It was a genocide."

However, CNN anchor Don Lemon expressed his fury over Santorum's explanation, criticizing him for not starting with an apology. "You didn't start with an apology," Lemon said. "You started with, 'I misspoke.'"

Critics accused Santorum of trying to erase diversity and downplay the atrocities committed against Native Americans. "Santorum's comments are a dangerous attempt to erase the diversity of American culture and downplay the horrific atrocities committed against Native Americans," said Rebecca Nagle, a Cherokee Nation citizen and author.

Santorum's attempt to clarify his comments met with skepticism and further criticism. "Santorum's attempt to clarify his comments is a pathetic attempt to save face," said Mark Trahant, editor of the Indian Country Today Media Network. "His original comments were offensive and racist, and his clarification is just as bad."

Santorum's comments have sparked a wider debate about the role of Native American culture in American society. Some argue that Native American culture has had a significant impact on American culture, while others argue that its influence has been minimal.

The debate is likely to continue, as the United States grapples with its history of colonialism and the ongoing legacy of discrimination against Native Americans.
