Chauvin Found Guilty in George Floyd Murder Trial, Sentenced to Prison

Minneapolis CNN – Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd, was found guilty on Tuesday of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter.

The jury reached its verdict after more than 10 hours of deliberation over two days. Chauvin's bail was revoked, and he was taken into custody following the verdict.

The charges stem from Chauvin's actions on May 25, 2020, when he knelt on Floyd's neck for over 9 minutes, leading to Floyd's death. The incident was captured on video and sparked widespread protests against racial injustice in the United States.

Chauvin faces a maximum sentence of 40 years for second-degree murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for manslaughter. Sentencing is scheduled for June 16.

"Today's verdict is a step forward towards justice in America," President Joe Biden said in a statement. "It is a reminder that we must all work together to root out the systemic racism that plagues our society."

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who prosecuted the case, said the verdict signifies accountability. "This verdict is a sign that accountability is possible," Ellison said. "It is a sign that justice can be done."

Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother, expressed relief and a sense of justice following the verdict. "Today, we are able to breathe again," Floyd said. "We are able to smile again."

The trial, which was broadcast live due to COVID-19 restrictions, drew national attention to the legal proceedings. The jury was sequestered throughout the trial and heard testimony from dozens of witnesses, including medical experts, law enforcement officers, and bystanders who witnessed Floyd's death.

The prosecution presented evidence that Chauvin's use of force was excessive and unreasonable and that he knew or should have known that his actions were creating a substantial risk of death or great bodily harm to Floyd. The defense argued that Chauvin was acting within the scope of his duties and that Floyd's death was caused by underlying health conditions and drug use.

The jury ultimately rejected the defense's arguments and found Chauvin guilty on all three charges. The verdict is a significant victory for the prosecution and a major step forward in the fight against racial injustice in the United States.

Reactions to the Verdict

The verdict has been met with mixed reactions. Some people have expressed relief and satisfaction that Chauvin has been held accountable for his actions. Others have expressed concern that the verdict does not go far enough and that Chauvin should have been convicted of first-degree murder.

"This verdict is a victory for justice," said Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Floyd family. "It is a victory for all those who have been victims of police brutality."

"This verdict is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough," said Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader. "We need to continue to fight for justice for all victims of police brutality."

The verdict is likely to have a significant impact on the ongoing debate about police reform in the United States. It is a reminder that police officers must be held accountable for their actions and that racial injustice remains a serious problem in our society.

The Legacy of George Floyd

George Floyd's death has had a profound impact on the United States. His death sparked widespread protests against racial injustice and led to a national conversation about police reform. Floyd's legacy will continue to inspire people to fight for justice and equality for all.

"George Floyd's death was a tragedy," said President Biden. "But his death has also been a catalyst for change. It has sparked a national conversation about race and policing, and it has led to a renewed commitment to justice and equality."

"George Floyd's legacy will be one of justice and change," said Philonise Floyd. "He will be remembered as a symbol of the fight against racial injustice."
