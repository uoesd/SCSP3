'Not Guilty' Gun Sale Sparks Controversy After Rittenhouse Acquittal

CONROE, Texas (KPRC) – A Texas gun store has sparked controversy with a "not guilty" sale following the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse.

Saddle River Range announced the promotion via text message to customers, offering deals on firearms, optics, bags, and gun parts. The message highlighted Rittenhouse's acquittal, stating, "Celebrate the Second Amendment and your right to self-defense."

The promotion has drawn mixed reactions from the public. Some have expressed disappointment over the store capitalizing on a sensitive situation.

"It's a little tone-deaf," said one customer. "I understand the store's message, but it feels like they're trying to profit from a tragedy."

Store owner Thomas Bolsch defended the sale, saying it was not intended to be disrespectful. "We're not celebrating the loss of life," Bolsch said. "We're celebrating the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense."

Bolsch added that most customer feedback has been supportive. "The vast majority of our customers understand the message we're trying to send," he said. "They support our right to bear arms and our right to defend ourselves."

Despite the criticism, Bolsch said he stands by his message and would not change the promotion. "I believe in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the right to self-defense," he said. "I'm not going to apologize for that."

Dr. James Dixon, president of the NAACP Houston Branch, emphasized the need for sensitivity in promotional messages. "We understand the store's message, but we also need to be mindful of the broader context," Dixon said. "This shooting happened in the wake of protests against racial injustice following the shooting of Jacob Blake."

Dixon added that the store's promotion has sparked a conversation about the intersection of business practices and societal issues. "It's important for businesses to be aware of the potential impact of their messages," he said. "We need to have a dialogue about how we can promote our values while also being respectful of the sensitivities of our community."

The Saddle River Range promotion has become a lightning rod for debate, highlighting the complex issues surrounding gun rights, self-defense, and the role of businesses in social discourse.
