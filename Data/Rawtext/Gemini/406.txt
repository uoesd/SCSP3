Chauvin Trial: Expert Testifies Knee on Floyd's Neck for Entire Encounter

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – A use-of-force expert testified Tuesday that former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee on George Floyd's neck area for the entirety of their fatal encounter.

Jody Stiger, a Los Angeles Police Department sergeant, said Chauvin applied pressure to Floyd's neck or neck area throughout the restraint period, which lasted for more than nine minutes.

"It was continuous," Stiger said. "There was no point in time where his knee was off Mr. Floyd's neck."

Defense attorney Eric Nelson suggested that Chauvin's knee was sometimes on Floyd's shoulder blade or base of his neck, not solely on his neck. However, Stiger maintained that Chauvin's knee was "primarily" on Floyd's neck.

"The majority of the weight was on the neck," Stiger said.

The testimony came during the third day of Chauvin's trial on charges of murder and manslaughter in the death of Floyd, who died during an arrest for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill.

Prosecutors have argued that Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck caused his death, while the defense contends that Floyd died from a combination of drug use and underlying health conditions.

Stiger acknowledged that police actions can be "lawful but awful," and discussed the impact of an onlooking crowd perceived as hostile by police. However, he said that Chauvin's actions were excessive and unreasonable.

"I don't think that the crowd had any impact on Mr. Chauvin's ability to control Mr. Floyd," Stiger said.

Chauvin's lawyer argued that Chauvin's actions should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, not in hindsight.

"We're not here to judge Officer Chauvin's actions based on 20/20 hindsight," Nelson said.

Stiger also mentioned that Chauvin used pain compliance techniques on Floyd and didn't ease up despite Floyd's visible distress.

"Mr. Floyd was clearly in pain," Stiger said. "He was saying, 'I can't breathe.' He was begging for his life."

Minnesota state investigator James Reyerson testified about the timeline of Chauvin's knee placement after Floyd ceased talking and moving. Reyerson initially misheard Floyd's statement on drug use but corrected his understanding after a longer video clip was played.

Reyerson said that Chauvin's knee remained on Floyd's neck for two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd stopped talking and for four minutes and 45 seconds after Floyd stopped moving.

The trial is expected to continue for several weeks.
