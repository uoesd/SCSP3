Eyewitnesses Recall Tense Altercation Involving Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie in Jackson Hole

Jackson Hole, Wyoming - New details have emerged regarding the final days of Gabby Petito's life, as eyewitnesses have come forward to recount an altercation involving the young woman, her fiancé Brian Laundrie, and staff at the Merry Piglets restaurant in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Nina Celie Angelo and Matthew England, a couple from New Orleans, witnessed the incident on August 27, 2021, and provided their account to Fox News Digital. According to Angelo, Laundrie exhibited aggressive behavior, arguing with staff members, possibly over the bill.

"He was being very aggressive," Angelo said. "He was arguing with the staff, and he came back in several times."

England added that Petito apologized for Laundrie's behavior during the incident. "She was very upset," he said. "She kept saying, 'I'm so sorry.'"

The restaurant manager and local law enforcement could not recall the incident, and the FBI declined to comment. However, the eyewitnesses connected the incident with Petito and Laundrie after seeing Utah police bodycam video released in September 2021.

"We saw the bodycam footage from Utah, and we knew it was them," Angelo said. "It was the same clothes, the same mannerisms."

England reported the incident to the FBI after realizing the couple in question was Petito and Laundrie. "I felt like I had to do something," he said. "I knew what I had seen, and I wanted to make sure it was investigated."

The incident occurred approximately two weeks after a reported confrontation between Petito and Laundrie in Moab, Utah, where police were called to investigate a domestic disturbance. Petito's remains were discovered at a campsite north of Jackson Hole a few weeks later; Laundrie returned to Florida without her on September 1.

The new information provided by the eyewitnesses sheds light on the final days of Petito's life and the circumstances surrounding her disappearance. It remains unclear whether the altercation at Merry Piglets played a role in the subsequent events that led to Petito's death. The FBI is continuing to investigate the case, and further details may emerge as the investigation progresses.
