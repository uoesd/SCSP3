Gabby Petito's Death Ruled Strangulation, Autopsy Reveals

Teton County, WY - The Teton County Coroner, Dr. Brent Blue, has determined that Gabby Petito's cause of death was strangulation. The announcement comes after an autopsy was conducted on her remains, which were found at a campground in the Bridger-Teton National Forest on September 19.

"The cause of death is strangulation," Dr. Blue stated. "The manner of death is homicide."

The autopsy results also revealed that Petito's remains had likely been outside for three to four weeks before they were discovered. However, the exact time of her death could not be determined.

"We were not able to determine the exact time of death," Dr. Blue explained. "We can only determine the cause and manner of death."

Petito's fiancé, Brian Laundrie, remains a person of interest in her case and is still missing. Authorities are actively searching for him, with assistance from his father.

"We are still looking for Brian Laundrie," Dr. Blue said. "We urge the public to provide any information they may have."

Gabby Petito's parents, Joe Petito and Jim Schmidt, expressed their grief and frustration at the news of their daughter's death.

"We are heartbroken," Joe Petito said. "We want justice for Gabby."

Schmidt added, "We believe Brian Laundrie is alive and in hiding. He is a coward."

The North Port community is planning a permanent memorial for Gabby Petito, replacing a makeshift memorial with a steel bench.

"We want to create a place where people can come to remember Gabby," Joe Petito said. "She was a beautiful soul who touched the lives of so many."

Laundrie's attorney, Steven Bertolino, released a statement expressing condolences to the Petito family and emphasizing that Laundrie is only a person of interest in Gabby's death.

"Gabby Petito's death is a tragedy," Bertolino said. "Brian Laundrie is only a person of interest in this case. He has not been charged with any crime."

The investigation into Gabby Petito's death is ongoing. Authorities are asking the public to provide any information they may have about Laundrie's whereabouts.
