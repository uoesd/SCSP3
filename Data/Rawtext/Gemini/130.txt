CNN Accused of 'Blackout' on Cuomo Scandals

CNN is facing criticism for allegedly ignoring sexual misconduct allegations against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and a COVID-19 testing scandal involving his brother, Chris Cuomo.

According to reports, CNN has not covered the claims made by Sherry Vill, Cuomo's ninth accuser, who alleges that he groped her at the governor's mansion. The network has also reportedly labeled other allegations of groping against Cuomo as "unverified."

Furthermore, CNN did not report on the VIP COVID-19 testing given to Chris Cuomo and his family for almost a week. When Chris Cuomo returned to his primetime show, he did not address the scandal.

CNN's defense of Chris Cuomo and the testing scandal has drawn criticism. A CNN spokesperson defended Chris Cuomo's actions during the pandemic, sparking outrage.

Fox News has criticized CNN's lack of coverage on these scandals, accusing the network of a "blackout" on negative news against the Cuomos.

The allegations against Andrew Cuomo have led to calls for his resignation, while the testing scandal has raised questions about Chris Cuomo's journalistic integrity. CNN's handling of these stories has further damaged the network's reputation.

Sources close to CNN have reportedly said that the network is reluctant to cover the scandals due to its close relationship with the Cuomos. Chris Cuomo has been a prominent anchor for CNN for many years, and his brother has been a frequent guest on the network.

The lack of coverage of these scandals has raised concerns about CNN's commitment to objective journalism. Critics argue that the network is putting its own interests ahead of the public's right to know.
