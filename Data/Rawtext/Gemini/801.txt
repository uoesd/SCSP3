U.S. Consumer Spending Surges 4.2% in March, Fueled by Stimulus and Wage Growth

WASHINGTON, April 30 – U.S. consumer spending rebounded strongly in March, rising 4.2% amid a surge in income due to government COVID-19 pandemic relief money and rising wages.

The Commerce Department reported on Friday that personal income boosted by 21.1% in March, helped by one-time $1,400 stimulus checks, leading to a saving rate soar to 27.6%.

"The stimulus checks are having a significant impact on consumer spending," said Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking at Citizens in Boston. "We're seeing a lot of people using the money to pay down debt, save for a down payment on a house, or invest in the stock market."

The strong consumer spending is a major boost to the U.S. economy, which is expected to grow at least 7% in 2021, according to economists.

"Consumer spending is the backbone of the U.S. economy, and it's clear that the stimulus is having a positive impact," said Sarah House, Senior Economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina. "We expect to see continued strong consumer spending in the second quarter."

The surge in consumer spending is also putting upward pressure on wages, as companies compete for workers. The Labor Department reported on Friday that labor costs surged by the most in 14 years in the first quarter, indicating increased wage growth.

"We're seeing a lot of companies raising wages to attract and retain workers," said Coughlin. "This is a positive sign for the economy, as it shows that businesses are confident in the future."

The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the rise in wages and inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank is "prepared to use our tools to ensure that inflation does not become a problem."

The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE price index, increased 1.8% in the 12 months through March. This is still below the Fed's target of 2%, but it is moving higher.

Economists expect the Fed to start raising interest rates in 2023 if inflation continues to rise. However, they do not expect the Fed to raise rates anytime soon.

"The Fed is going to be very patient in raising interest rates," said House. "They want to make sure that the economy is fully recovered before they start to tighten monetary policy."

Strong Consumer Spending to Continue

Economists expect consumer spending to continue to accelerate in the second quarter, as the government's expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination program and fiscal generosity are lifting consumer spirits.

"Consumer confidence is at a high level, and people are starting to feel more comfortable about spending money," said Coughlin. "We expect to see continued strong consumer spending in the coming months."

Wage increases are also expected to sustain consumer spending even as the stimulus effect fades.

"The rise in wages is going to help to support consumer spending in the long run," said House. "Even as the stimulus checks run out, people will still have more money to spend because of the higher wages."

Risks to Consumer Spending

There are some risks to the consumer spending outlook. One risk is that the COVID-19 pandemic could worsen again, leading to renewed lockdowns and a slowdown in economic activity.

Another risk is that inflation could rise too quickly, eroding the purchasing power of consumers.

However, economists believe that the risks to consumer spending are outweighed by the positive factors.

"The consumer is in a strong position," said House. "They have a lot of savings, they're getting higher wages, and they're feeling more confident about the future. This is going to support continued strong consumer spending in the coming months."
