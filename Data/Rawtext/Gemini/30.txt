New Radicals Reunite for Biden Inauguration, Bringing Message of Hope

After a 22-year hiatus, the iconic band New Radicals reunited for a special performance at the Biden-Harris virtual inaugural parade, delivering a poignant rendition of their timeless anthem "You Get What You Give."

The band, essentially a duo comprising singer Gregg Alexander and percussionist Danielle Brisebois, burst onto the music scene in 1998 with their critically acclaimed album "Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too." The album's lead single, "You Get What You Give," became an instant classic, celebrated for its optimistic message and infectious melody.

The song holds particular significance for the Biden family. President Biden's late son Beau used it as a psych-up song during his chemotherapy treatments, finding solace in its uplifting lyrics.

Despite the album's success, New Radicals dissolved before releasing their second single. Alexander, the band's primary songwriter, found the spotlight too stressful and opted to pursue a quieter life.

However, the band's members continued to influence pop music. Alexander collaborated with artists such as Ronan Keating and Santana, while Brisebois worked with Alanis Morissette and others.

Alexander's performance at the inauguration marked a moment of optimism and resilience for many. The song "You Get What You Give" has become an American standard, carrying the Presidential seal of approval.

The reunion and performance emphasized a message of hope and the possibility of America "pulling through" its challenges. The lyrics, "You get what you give, so give it what you got," resonated with a nation yearning for unity and healing.

Alexander's performance was a reminder of the power of music to inspire and uplift. The song's message of optimism and resilience has become a beacon of hope for Americans facing unprecedented challenges.

The reunion of New Radicals was not only a nostalgic moment but also a symbol of the enduring power of music to connect people and inspire positive change. As the nation embarks on a new chapter, "You Get What You Give" serves as a timeless anthem of hope and a reminder that even in the darkest of times, we can find strength and unity in the power of music.

The song's lyrics, "You get what you give, so give it what you got," have become a mantra for those seeking to make a difference in the world. The reunion of New Radicals and their performance at the inauguration have reignited the song's message of hope and resilience, reminding us that even in the face of adversity, we can overcome challenges and create a better future for ourselves and generations to come.
