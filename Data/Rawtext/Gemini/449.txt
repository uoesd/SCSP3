Sussexes' Mansion Hit by Nine Police Calls in Nine Months

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's mansion in southern California has been the subject of nine police calls in the past nine months, raising concerns about their security arrangements.

The calls, which include phone requests, alarm activations, and property crimes, have prompted a response from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office. In July alone, there were four calls to police, including a phone request and several alarm activations.

On Christmas Eve, a trespassing incident occurred at the property, resulting in the arrest of Nickolas Brooks. The most recent police call was an alarm activation at 2.21am on February 16.

Representatives of the Sussexes and the sheriff's department have declined to comment on the incidents. However, the couple's security became a public concern after their bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021.

During the interview, Meghan pleaded with Harry's family not to remove his personal protection due to the death threats they had received. Harry expressed surprise at losing his UK taxpayer-funded security after stepping back from royal duties.

Since then, the Sussexes have privately funded their security arrangements in the US. The increased police presence at their mansion suggests that they may be facing ongoing security concerns.

The couple's decision to step back from royal duties and move to the US has been met with mixed reactions. Some have criticized them for seeking privacy while maintaining a high profile, while others have expressed sympathy for their desire to live a more independent life.

The security concerns surrounding the Sussexes highlight the challenges of balancing privacy and safety in the public eye. As they continue to navigate their new lives in the US, it remains to be seen how they will address the ongoing security threats they face.

The couple's decision to privately fund their security arrangements has also raised questions about the role of the British monarchy in protecting its members. The Sussexes' departure from the royal family has sparked a debate about the extent to which the monarchy should provide financial support to its former members.

As the Sussexes continue to chart their own path, it is likely that their security arrangements will remain under scrutiny. The ongoing police calls at their mansion serve as a reminder of the challenges they face in balancing their desire for privacy with the need to protect themselves and their family.
