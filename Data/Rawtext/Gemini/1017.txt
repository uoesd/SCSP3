Graham Vows to Remove Protections for Twitter After Trump Ban

WASHINGTON (WCSC) – U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has vowed to remove protections that shield companies like Twitter from lawsuits, following the platform's permanent ban of President Donald Trump.

Graham's determination stems from his criticism of Twitter's decision, which he likened to the Ayatollah's ability to tweet while Trump, a former U.S. president, is silenced. He condemned "Big Tech" for having "absolute immunity from being sued," a protection granted by Congress under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

"If you're going to be a publisher, you should be treated like a publisher," Graham said. "You should not have immunity from being sued."

Twitter banned Trump on January 8, citing two tweets that violated its policies against glorifying violence. One tweet announced Trump's decision not to attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, which Twitter interpreted as potentially encouraging violent acts. The other tweet used the phrase "American Patriots," which Twitter claimed could be seen as support for those committing violent acts at the U.S. Capitol.

The platform also expressed concerns about future armed protests and a proposed attack on the U.S. Capitol and state capitol buildings. Trump's account was locked following the riot at the U.S. Capitol, which some attribute to his rhetoric.

Graham's proposed repeal of Section 230 would place tech companies on the same legal footing as other companies, making them liable for content posted on their platforms. He argues that this would encourage platforms to take a more proactive approach to moderating content and preventing the spread of harmful or dangerous speech.

"We're going to make sure that Big Tech is not above the law," Graham said. "They're going to be held accountable for the content that's on their platforms."

Twitter has defended its decision to ban Trump, stating that it was necessary to protect the safety of its users and the public. The company has also argued that Section 230 is essential for protecting freedom of speech online and allowing platforms to moderate content without fear of legal liability.

However, Graham and other critics argue that Section 230 has gone too far in protecting tech companies and that it has allowed them to become too powerful and unaccountable. They believe that repealing Section 230 would restore balance to the internet and ensure that tech companies are held responsible for the content they host.

The debate over Section 230 is likely to continue as Congress considers potential reforms. Graham's proposal to repeal the provision is expected to face strong opposition from tech companies and free speech advocates, who argue that it would stifle innovation and harm online discourse.
