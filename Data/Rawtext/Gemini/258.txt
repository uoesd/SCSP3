Biden Intensifies Investigation into COVID-19 Origins, Demands Answers from China

President Joe Biden has emphasized the critical importance of investigating the origins of COVID-19, reiterating his early call for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to gain access to China to better understand the virus. Despite initial hindrances, Biden tasked the Intelligence Community with preparing a report on the virus's origins shortly after taking office in March.

The Intelligence Community's report outlined two likely scenarios but did not reach a definitive conclusion. In light of this, Biden has requested the Intelligence Community to intensify their efforts to analyze information related to the virus's origins and report back with a more definitive conclusion within 90 days. The investigation will involve asking specific questions to China and collaborating with international partners to press for a transparent investigation.

Biden emphasized the need for multiple agencies, including National Labs, to support the Intelligence Community's work. He stressed that the investigation is not about assigning blame but about understanding the origins of the virus to prevent future pandemics.

The President's directive underscores the administration's commitment to unraveling the mystery surrounding the origins of COVID-19. By intensifying the investigation and demanding answers from China, the United States aims to contribute to global efforts to prevent and mitigate future pandemics.
