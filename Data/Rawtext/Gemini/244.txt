FDA Expands Booster Dose Eligibility, Authorizes Mix-and-Match Approach

Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today announced the expansion of booster dose eligibility for COVID-19 vaccines in eligible populations. The agency has also authorized the use of a "mix-and-match" approach for booster doses, allowing individuals to receive a different vaccine brand than the one used for their primary vaccination series.

Moderna Booster Authorized for Older Adults and High-Risk Individuals

The FDA has authorized a booster dose of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 65 years of age and older, as well as those 18-64 years of age who are at high risk of severe COVID-19 or who have frequent exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The booster dose should be administered at least six months after completion of the primary vaccination series.

Janssen Booster Authorized for All Adults

The FDA has authorized a booster dose of Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 18 years of age and older. The booster dose should be administered at least two months after the initial dose.

Pfizer-BioNTech Booster Clarified for Younger Adults with Frequent Exposure

The FDA has clarified its authorization for a booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 18-64 years of age who have frequent exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The booster dose should be administered at least six months after completion of the primary vaccination series.

Mix-and-Match Booster Approach Approved

The FDA has approved the use of a "mix-and-match" approach for booster doses, allowing individuals to receive a different vaccine brand than the one used for their primary vaccination series. The eligibility and dosing interval for mix-and-match boosters align with those for vaccines used in primary vaccination.

Safety and Efficacy Data Support Booster Dose Authorizations

The FDA's decision to expand booster dose eligibility and authorize the mix-and-match approach is based on a thorough review of safety and immunity response data from clinical trials. The data demonstrate that booster doses provide a significant increase in antibody levels and protection against COVID-19, including against the Omicron variant.

Side Effects Similar to Primary Doses

The side effects experienced after booster doses are similar to those experienced after the primary doses of COVID-19 vaccines. These side effects are typically mild and resolve within a few days.

Increased Risk of Myocarditis and Pericarditis Identified

The FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have identified an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart) following COVID-19 vaccination, particularly in younger males. However, the overall safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines remains favorable, and the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.

Health Care Providers Encouraged to Follow CDC Recommendations

Health care providers are encouraged to follow CDC recommendations on booster dose administrations. The CDC provides guidance on who should receive a booster dose, when to administer the booster dose, and which vaccine brand to use.
