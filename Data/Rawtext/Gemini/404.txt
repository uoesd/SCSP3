Medical Examiner: Floyd's Death a Homicide, Despite Contributing Factors

Minneapolis, MN - In a pivotal development in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with murdering George Floyd, medical experts testified that Floyd's death was a homicide caused by law enforcement actions, despite his underlying health conditions and drug use.

Dr. Andrew Baker, Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner, stated unequivocally that Floyd's death was a "homicide caused by cardiopulmonary arrest during law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression."

"Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions, including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. He also had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system," Dr. Baker acknowledged. "However, these factors did not directly cause his death."

Dr. Baker emphasized that the law enforcement actions were the primary cause of Floyd's death. "The subdual, restraint, and neck compression applied by law enforcement officers resulted in Mr. Floyd's death," he said.

The defense has argued that Floyd's death was due to drug use and preexisting health conditions. However, Dr. Baker maintained his stance on homicide, stating, "The totality of the circumstances indicate that Mr. Floyd's death was caused by the actions of law enforcement."

Forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas corroborated Dr. Baker's findings, testifying that Floyd died from low oxygen, or asphyxia, due to law enforcement restraint. "Mr. Floyd's death was caused by a lack of oxygen to his brain," Dr. Thomas said. "This was due to the pressure applied to his neck and back by the officers."

Both medical professionals dismissed the idea that Floyd's health conditions and drug levels were relevant to his instantaneous death. "Mr. Floyd's underlying health conditions and drug use did not contribute to his death," Dr. Baker said. "They were not a substantial factor in his death."

An independent autopsy commissioned by Floyd's family cited asphyxiation as the cause of death, contrasting the official autopsy that did not mention it. However, Dr. Baker explained that the lack of anatomical evidence of asphyxiation was not uncommon.

"Asphyxia can occur without leaving any visible injuries," Dr. Baker said. "In this case, the video evidence was crucial in determining the cause and manner of Mr. Floyd's death."

Video evidence showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for over nine minutes, even after Floyd became unresponsive. "The video evidence clearly shows that Mr. Floyd was not breathing," Dr. Thomas said. "He was in a state of asphyxia."

Dr. Martin Tobin, a pulmonary critical care doctor, testified that a healthy individual subjected to the same conditions as Floyd would have also died. "Mr. Floyd's death was not due to his underlying health conditions or drug use," Dr. Tobin said. "It was due to the actions of law enforcement."

Photos of Floyd's injuries were presented, supporting the conclusion that he was trying to position himself to breathe amidst restraint. "Mr. Floyd's injuries are consistent with someone who is trying to breathe," Dr. Thomas said. "He was trying to get air into his lungs, but he was unable to do so."

The medical testimony in the Chauvin trial has been pivotal in establishing the cause and manner of Floyd's death. The experts have consistently maintained that Floyd's death was a homicide caused by law enforcement actions, despite his underlying health conditions and drug use.
