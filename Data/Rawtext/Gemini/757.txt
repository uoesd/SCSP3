'Rust' Producers Distance Themselves from Troubled Film Amid Ongoing Investigation

Los Angeles, CA - In the wake of the tragic shooting on the set of the Western film "Rust," executive producers have disavowed responsibility for the production, claiming their role was limited to financing.

Allen Cheney, along with Emily Salveson and her Streamline Global finance company, emphasized their lack of involvement in day-to-day operations. "Our role was solely to provide financing for the film," Cheney stated. "We had no involvement in the production or hiring of crew members."

The tragedy on the "Rust" set occurred on October 21, 2021, when actor Alec Baldwin accidentally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza with a live round. The incident has sparked scrutiny into the production's alleged cost-cutting measures and the hiring of non-union crew members.

Bondit Media Capital, initially named as a co-financier, has clarified that it only loaned money against distribution collateral and did not have an equity stake in the film. This revelation raises questions about the financial arrangements and management oversight of the production.

District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies has not ruled out Alec Baldwin as a person of interest in the ongoing investigation. "We are still gathering information and evidence," Carmack-Altwies said. "No one has been ruled out at this point."

Financial arrangements for "Rust" involved sales of North American distribution rights and foreign presales totaling $3 million. Emily Salveson and Ryan Donnell Smith, who have a background in financing through tax incentives, were involved in securing these funds.

"Rust Movie Productions LLC," the production company behind the film, is owned by Cheney and Donnell Smith. The company has operational ties to Thomasville Pictures, a production company founded by Salveson and Donnell Smith.

Producers' Disclaimer

"We are deeply saddened by the tragic accident that occurred on the set of 'Rust,'" Cheney said. "Our hearts go out to the victims and their families. We want to emphasize that our involvement in the film was strictly limited to financing. We had no control over the production or the hiring of crew members."
