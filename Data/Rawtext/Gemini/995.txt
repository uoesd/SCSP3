Trump Incited Capitol Riot, Impeachment Managers Argue

WASHINGTON – House impeachment managers presented a detailed account of former President Donald Trump's actions and rhetoric leading up to and during the January 6 Capitol riot, arguing that he incited the violence and showed no remorse afterwards.

Through audio and video clips, the managers demonstrated Trump's failure to act as the riot unfolded, despite being aware of the unfolding events. Rioters themselves testified that they went to the Capitol at Trump's invitation, believing they were acting on his instructions.

"The evidence is clear: President Trump incited an insurrection against the United States government," said Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), a House impeachment manager. "He did so by repeatedly lying about the election, by urging his supporters to 'fight like hell,' and by refusing to call off the mob even as it stormed the Capitol."

Trump's tweets throughout January 6 urged his supporters to reject the electoral votes and "fight," which impeachment managers cited as encouragement for the riot.

"We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore," Trump said in a speech on January 6.

Trump made a series of tweets throughout the day that, according to impeachment managers, incited or supported the riotous behavior.

"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!" Trump tweeted on December 19, 2020.

"All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical left Democrats," Trump said in a speech on January 6. "We will not let them silence your voices. We're not going to let them take away our country."

Trump was accused of not taking immediate action to deter the rioters, instead attacking Vice President Mike Pence in a tweet for not overturning the election results.

"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution," Trump tweeted.

Trump's video message hours after the riot began told the rioters, "We love you, you're very special. ... But go home and go home in peace."

Some of Trump's tweets during the riot were deleted, and he was temporarily banned from Twitter for 12 hours, later being permanently banned.

"The evidence is clear: President Trump incited an insurrection against the United States government," DeGette said. "He is responsible for the violence that occurred on January 6th, and he must be held accountable."

Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama) testified that he informed Trump during the riot that Pence had been evacuated. Trump allegedly told him to continue objecting to the election results.

"I told him that Pence had been evacuated and that we were starting to clear the Capitol," Tuberville said. "And he said, 'Well, do you think we should continue to object to the vote?'"

Tuberville said he told Trump that they should continue objecting, and Trump replied, "Okay."

The impeachment managers argued that Trump's actions and rhetoric amounted to a "clear and present danger" to the United States. They urged the Senate to convict Trump and bar him from holding office again.

"President Trump's actions on January 6th were a betrayal of his oath of office and a betrayal of our country," DeGette said. "He must be held accountable for his actions."

The Senate is expected to vote on whether to convict Trump on Saturday. A two-thirds majority is required for conviction.
