Israeli Film Industry Boasts Unblemished Prop Gun Safety Record

In the wake of the tragic prop gun incident on the set of the Western film "Rust," the Israeli film industry has expressed confidence that such an accident could not occur in their country.

The compulsory military service in Israel instills a deep familiarity and respect for firearms among Israeli filmmakers, creating a culture of safety and responsibility on movie sets.

"In Israel, we have a very different approach to prop guns," said veteran director Avi Nesher. "We take safety extremely seriously. Everyone on set, from the actors to the crew, undergoes rigorous training and follows strict safety protocols."

Nesher emphasizes that on his sets, prop guns are always treated as if they are loaded, even when they are not. "We never allow anyone to point a prop gun at another person, even if it's just for a rehearsal," he said. "We use finger guns for initial rehearsals, and only switch to prop guns when we're actually filming."

Other Israeli industry insiders echoed Nesher's sentiments, citing a culture of safety and respect for firearms as key to preventing accidents.

"We have a very disciplined approach to prop gun safety in Israel," said director Kobi Machat. "We follow strict protocols, and everyone on set is aware of the potential risks."

Ophir Award-winning cinematographer Tobias Hochstein expressed sadness over the death of Halyna Hutchins, the cinematographer who was killed by a prop gun on the set of "Rust." "This is a tragedy that should never have happened," he said. "Safety should always be the top priority on any film set."

Hochstein emphasized that in Israel, prop guns are managed by experienced professionals who have a deep understanding of firearms. "We don't allow anyone to handle a prop gun who doesn't have the proper training," he said.

The lower budgets of Israeli films also contribute to a safer environment, according to industry insiders. With fewer people involved in the process, there is less potential for accidents.

"On a large Hollywood production, there can be hundreds of people on set," said Nesher. "In Israel, our crews are much smaller, which allows us to maintain a higher level of control and safety."

The Israeli film industry's unblemished prop gun safety record stands in stark contrast to the recent incident in the United States. Critics have pointed to a lack of real firearms knowledge and lax safety protocols in the American film industry.

"It's clear that there needs to be a change in the way prop guns are managed in the American film industry," said Hochstein. "We can learn a lot from the Israeli model, where safety is always the top priority."

The Israeli film industry's commitment to safety has not only prevented accidents but has also fostered a culture of respect and professionalism on movie sets.

"When everyone on set knows that safety is paramount, it creates a positive and productive work environment," said Machat. "It allows us to focus on making great films without having to worry about accidents."

As the American film industry grapples with the aftermath of the "Rust" tragedy, the Israeli film industry stands as a shining example of how to manage prop guns safely and responsibly.
