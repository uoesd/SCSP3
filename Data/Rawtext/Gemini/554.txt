Families of Kabul Airport Victims Seek UK Help Amidst Evacuation Chaos

In the aftermath of the devastating Kabul airport attack, relatives of Afghans injured or killed are desperately seeking assistance from the British government to bring their loved ones to the UK.

Among the victims was Musa Popal, a 60-year-old British shopkeeper who was tragically killed in the blast. His family has expressed deep frustration over the lack of support they have received from the Foreign Office.

"We feel ignored," said Zohra Popal, Musa's daughter. "My father was a British citizen, and he deserves to be treated with respect."

Another victim, 23-month-old Muhammad Raza, is currently receiving critical care in Kabul for injuries sustained in the attack, including shrapnel removal. His mother, Basbibi, is pleading for help to bring her son to the UK for specialized treatment.

"My baby is in agony," she said. "He needs urgent medical attention that is not available here."

The Ministry of Defence has stated that only UK nationals and Afghans already processed would be airlifted. However, this has left many families in limbo, unsure if their loved ones will be evacuated.

Despite the challenges, the British government has airlifted 15,000 people from Kabul, including 2,200 children. Among them was a baby girl named Havva, who was born on an RAF evacuation flight to Birmingham.

"It was a miracle," said her mother. "We are so grateful to the British government for saving our lives."

However, the evacuation effort has been marred by tragedy. Mohammad Niazi, another Londoner, was killed in the attack along with his wife and two of their children while trying to evacuate.

"They were desperate to leave," said Imran Niazi, a friend of Mohammad. "They had been waiting for days, and they were so close to getting out."

Around 170 people and 13 US military personnel are estimated to have been killed in the attack. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the bombing, which has been condemned by the international community.

The British government has expressed its condolences to the victims and their families. However, many relatives feel that more could have been done to prevent the tragedy.

"We need answers," said Zohra Popal. "We need to know why our loved ones were left behind."

As the evacuation effort continues, families of the victims are left with a mix of grief and uncertainty. They hope that the British government will step up and provide the support they need to bring their loved ones to safety.
