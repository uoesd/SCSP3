Royal Welcome: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Welcome Daughter Lilibet Diana

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have welcomed their second child, a daughter named Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, into the world. The baby girl was born on June 4, 2021, at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California, weighing 7 pounds, 11 ounces.

The name Lilibet is a touching tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, who was affectionately known as "Lilibet" within the royal family during her childhood. The name Diana honors Harry's late mother, Princess Diana.

Both Meghan and Lilibet are reported to be healthy and well. The couple has requested that well-wishers support charities dedicated to improving the lives of women and girls in lieu of sending gifts.

Harry and Meghan will take parental leave from their work at the Archewell Foundation to focus on their growing family. Lilibet is the Sussexes' second child and is eighth in line to the British throne.

The arrival of Lilibet is a joyous occasion for the couple, who have faced challenges in recent years. In 2020, Meghan suffered a miscarriage, which she bravely shared in a New York Times op-ed. The couple also stepped down as working members of the royal family in 2020 and have since aired grievances in a high-profile interview with Oprah Winfrey.

Archie and Lilibet are the only biracial members of the British royal family, a significant milestone in the monarchy's history. Their arrival brings hope for a more inclusive and representative future for the institution.

Harry and Meghan have stated that Lilibet is likely to be their last child, citing environmental concerns. The couple is committed to living a sustainable life and raising their children with a deep appreciation for the planet.

The birth of Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor is a momentous occasion for the royal family and the world. She is a symbol of hope, resilience, and the enduring power of love.
