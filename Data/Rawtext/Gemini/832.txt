Tiger Woods Crash Investigation Concludes, Cause Undisclosed

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has concluded its investigation into Tiger Woods' car crash on February 23, but the cause of the accident remains undisclosed due to privacy concerns.

"We have reached out to Tiger Woods and his personnel," said Sheriff Alex Villanueva. "If they waive the privacy, then we will be able to release the information."

The crash occurred when Woods' SUV struck a sign, sheared through a tree, and landed in the brush with significant damage. Woods was unconscious at some point after the crash but conscious when deputies arrived.

"A witness reported that Mr. Woods was unconscious at the scene," said Deputy Johann Schloegl, the traffic collision investigator.

Woods underwent emergency surgery for significant injuries to his right lower extremity and returned home in mid-March to continue his recovery.

"Tiger is focused on his recovery," said a source close to the golfer. "He feels lucky to be alive and appreciates the access to great medical care."

Woods confirmed on social media that he is back home continuing his recovery and has reunited with his children.

"I'm so grateful for the support and love I've received during this difficult time," Woods wrote. "I'm making progress and feeling better every day."

The investigation into the crash has been thorough, according to Villanueva.

"We have interviewed all the witnesses, collected all the evidence, and analyzed all the data," Villanueva said. "We have determined the cause of the crash, but we cannot release that information at this time."

Villanueva said the decision to withhold the information was made after consulting with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.

"We have a responsibility to protect the privacy of all individuals involved in this case," Villanueva said. "We believe that releasing the cause of the crash at this time would violate that privacy."

Woods' team has not yet responded to the Sheriff's Department's request to waive the privacy.

"We are hopeful that they will cooperate with us," Villanueva said. "We believe that the public has a right to know the cause of this crash."

The crash has been a major setback for Woods, who was just starting to return to competitive golf after a long layoff due to back injuries.

"Tiger is a fighter," the source said. "He's going to come back from this and be even stronger than before."
