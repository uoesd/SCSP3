Newark Schools Grapple with Catastrophic Damage from Tropical Storm Ida

Tropical Storm Ida left a trail of devastation in New Jersey, claiming the lives of at least 27 people and causing significant damage to infrastructure, including Newark school buildings.

The storm unleashed its fury on Newark schools, resulting in a fire, flooding, and the destruction of gym floors. Initial estimates suggest at least $5 million in damage, a figure expected to rise as assessments continue.

"The damage is catastrophic," said Dawn Haynes, president of the Newark school board. "We have schools that are flooded, schools that have had fires, and schools that have had their gym floors destroyed."

The widespread damage forced nearby school districts to consider delaying the start of the school year. However, Newark schools opened as scheduled on September 8, thanks to the tireless efforts of maintenance crews, custodians, and other employees.

"Our employees put their own needs aside to make sure that our children had a safe and welcoming place to learn," Haynes said. "I am so grateful for their hard work and dedication."

New Jersey remains under a state of emergency due to the damage from Tropical Storm Ida. President Joe Biden visited the state on September 7 to tour the damage and meet with affected residents.

"We are here to help New Jersey recover from this devastating storm," Biden said. "We will provide all the resources necessary to rebuild and repair."

Some 33 Newark district buildings were flooded, affecting various facilities and parts of the schools. The district has not disclosed which schools were damaged nor if they will receive state or federal disaster relief funds.

"We are still assessing the damage and working to determine the full extent of the costs," Haynes said. "We are hopeful that we will receive assistance from the state and federal government to help us rebuild."

The damage caused by Tropical Storm Ida is a major setback for Newark schools, which have already faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the district is committed to providing a quality education for all students, despite the obstacles.

"We will not let this storm define us," Haynes said. "We will come back stronger than ever."
