Ever Given Container Ship Blocks Suez Canal, Disrupting Global Trade

Cairo, Egypt CNN – A massive container ship named Ever Given has run aground in Egypt's Suez Canal, blocking traffic in one of the world's busiest waterways.

The 224,000-ton vessel, flagged under Panama, became stuck on Tuesday due to 40-knot winds and a sandstorm that caused low visibility and poor navigation. The ship, which is almost as long as the Empire State Building is tall, is causing a significant traffic jam in the canal.

Eight tug boats are currently attempting to free the Ever Given, but the operation is proving to be technically complicated. "Re-floating the ship is not an easy task," said a senior canal pilot at the Suez Canal Authority. "It could take days."

The Suez Canal accounts for about 30% of global container ship traffic each day, with nearly 19,000 ships passing through in 2020. The blockage is already having a significant impact on global trade, with tankers carrying oil from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Oman, and the US among those waiting at both ends of the canal.

Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, says seven of its vessels have been affected by the blockage. "We are monitoring the situation closely and are working with the relevant authorities to find a solution as soon as possible," a Maersk spokesperson said.

The disruption may also impact oil and gas flows depending on the duration it takes to clear the container ship. Industry sources suggest it could be resolved in days rather than weeks.

The canal pilot suggests that the ship is likely to be towed to the nearest parking site for offloading and minor repairs. "Once the ship is lightened, it will be easier to tow," he said.

The Suez Canal Authority is working around the clock to resolve the situation. "We are doing everything we can to free the ship as soon as possible," said a spokesperson for the authority.

The blockage is a major test for the Suez Canal Authority, which has a long history of managing traffic in one of the world's most important waterways. The authority has successfully navigated previous incidents, including the grounding of a large container ship in 2016.

The Ever Given incident is a reminder of the importance of the Suez Canal to global trade. The canal provides a vital link between Europe and Asia, and any disruption to traffic can have a significant impact on the global economy.
