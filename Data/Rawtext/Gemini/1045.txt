Texas Attorney General Paxton Travels to Utah Amid Winter Crisis

CNN – Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his wife traveled to Utah during the severe winter storms that left millions of Texans without power and water. The trip's timing and purpose have drawn criticism from Democratic officials and figures.

Paxton's campaign spokesperson, Ian Prior, defended the trip, stating that it occurred after power had been largely restored in Texas. "The Attorney General and his wife traveled to Utah after power had been restored to most Texans," Prior said. "He went to meet with the Utah Attorney General to discuss legal matters and a Google lawsuit."

Paxton's trip marks the second high-profile Republican to leave Texas amid the winter crisis, following Sen. Ted Cruz's trip to Cancun. Cruz admitted his trip was a mistake upon returning, amid criticism for leaving during the state's emergency.

However, Cruz's role as a federal official differs from Paxton's state responsibilities, which include aspects of disaster response. "The Attorney General's office has a role in disaster response, including coordinating with other state agencies and providing legal guidance," said Gary Rasp, a media specialist for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Democratic officials and figures have criticized Paxton and Cruz for their actions during the crisis. "It's outrageous that these elected officials are leaving the state during a time of crisis," said Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa. "They should be here working to help their constituents, not jetting off to other states."

Texas faced a severe shortage of power and water during the winter storms, impacting millions of residents. As of Monday evening, 8.6 million people were still experiencing water disruptions. The winter storm's aftermath in Texas may require weeks or months for full recovery.

Paxton's trip to Utah has raised questions about his commitment to serving the people of Texas during a time of crisis. While his spokesperson defended the trip as occurring after power had been restored, the timing and purpose of the trip have drawn criticism from those who believe he should have remained in Texas to assist with the recovery efforts.
