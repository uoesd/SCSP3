Oprah Winfrey's Interview with Harry and Meghan: A Triumph of Media Savvy

Oprah Winfrey's highly anticipated interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, which aired on CBS on March 7, 2021, drew a massive audience of over 17 million viewers, solidifying Winfrey's status as a media powerhouse.

The interview's success underscores Winfrey's astute media strategy and the enduring relevance of live-event television. Winfrey has deftly navigated the evolving media landscape, engaging with multiple platforms to maximize her reach.

"Oprah Winfrey is a master of selecting the appropriate platform for different content," said Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School. "She understands the strengths and weaknesses of each platform and tailors her content accordingly."

Winfrey's diverse media ventures include a significant content deal with Apple and producing projects for Warner Bros. Her reported sale of the Harry and Meghan interview to CBS for $7 million further demonstrates her business acumen.

The special achieved a 2.6 rating among adults ages 18 to 49, indicating strong interest from younger viewers. This is particularly notable given the streaming limitations of the CBS special due to existing deals.

Despite the streaming limitations, Winfrey's continued influence in media is undeniable. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have also embarked on their own media ventures, signing deals with Netflix and Spotify.

Winfrey's Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) is now 95 percent owned by Discovery, following Winfrey's sale of shares. This strategic move exemplifies Winfrey's savvy business sense, as she exchanged her shares for Discovery stock, significantly increasing the value of her investment.

"Oprah Winfrey is a visionary who has consistently adapted to the changing media landscape," said Koehn. "She has a unique ability to connect with audiences on a personal level, which is why she remains one of the most influential figures in media today."

Winfrey's interview with Harry and Meghan Markle was a watershed moment in media history, showcasing her unparalleled ability to captivate audiences and generate global headlines. Her continued success serves as a testament to her media savvy and her enduring relevance in the ever-evolving world of entertainment.
