Cuomo Conflict: CNN Host Recuses Himself from Brother's Harassment Coverage

NEW YORK (AP) – CNN host Chris Cuomo stated on Monday that he cannot cover stories about his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, due to the sexual harassment accusations against him.

"When my brother became governor, I tried to be there for him and my family in every way I could," Chris Cuomo said at the start of his prime time show. "Now, I have a responsibility to this audience and to my colleagues as a journalist."

CNN's commitment to covering the story was affirmed by Cuomo, who emphasized that the network would continue to do so.

During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cuomo brothers appeared together on CNN, raising ethical concerns. CNN had a rule prohibiting Chris Cuomo from covering stories about his brother, but it was temporarily suspended during the pandemic.

Andrew Cuomo has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, prompting demands for an independent investigation.

"It's a clear conflict of interest," said Steven Thrasher, a journalism professor at Northwestern University. "Chris Cuomo cannot be both a journalist and an advocate for his brother."

Scott Stroud, ethics director at the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin, agreed. "CNN's decision to allow the Cuomo brothers to interact on air violated journalistic ethics," he said.

The allegations of misconduct against Andrew Cuomo are part of a larger pattern of accusations of bullying and questionable policies during the pandemic.

"This is not just about sexual harassment," said Jacqueline Jones, a professor at Morgan State University's School of Global Journalism and Communication. "It's about a culture of abuse and intimidation that has been created by Governor Cuomo."

Fox News Channel meteorologist Janice Dean, who has been critical of Gov. Cuomo's nursing home policies, dismissed Chris Cuomo's statement as insufficient. "He needs to recuse himself from all coverage of his brother," she said.

CNN continues to cover the story of Gov. Cuomo's allegations on other parts of the network.

The situation highlights the blurring lines between news, punditry, and entertainment in broadcast and cable news programming.

"The public needs to be able to trust that journalists are acting in their best interests," said Thrasher. "When that trust is broken, it undermines the credibility of the entire profession."

Chris Cuomo's decision to recuse himself from covering his brother's story is a step in the right direction, but it does not address the larger issue of the blurring of lines between news and entertainment in cable news.

"The public needs to be able to distinguish between fact and opinion," said Stroud. "When news organizations allow pundits to masquerade as journalists, it makes it difficult for people to make informed decisions about the issues that affect their lives."

The Cuomo brothers' situation is a reminder that journalists have a responsibility to maintain their independence and objectivity. When they fail to do so, it erodes the public's trust in the media.
