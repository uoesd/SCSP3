Defendants Take the Stand in High-Profile Trials, Challenging Traditional Reluctance

CHICAGO (AP) – In a departure from the traditional reluctance to testify, defendants in high-profile trials are increasingly choosing to take the stand, challenging the long-held wisdom that it is a risky move.

Recent cases involving Kim Potter, the former Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Daunte Wright, and Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who killed two people during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, have highlighted this trend. Both defendants testified in their own defense, with Potter being convicted of manslaughter and Rittenhouse acquitted of all charges.

"There's been a shift in the way that defendants are approaching their cases," said Alan Tuerkheimer, a Chicago-based jury consultant. "Social media has played a role in this, as defendants are more aware of the public's perception of their case and feel the need to speak out."

Tuerkheimer believes that social media has also influenced jurors' expectations, making them more receptive to hearing directly from the defendant. "Jurors are used to seeing people speak out on social media, so they may be more inclined to believe a defendant who takes the stand and tells their story," he said.

However, former federal prosecutor Phil Turner remains skeptical about a significant shift in lawyers' attitudes towards defendants testifying. "I don't think there's been a fundamental change in the way that lawyers approach this issue," he said. "It's still a very risky proposition, and most lawyers will only recommend it if they believe the defendant has a strong case."

In recent years, several high-profile defendants have taken the stand, including Jussie Smollett, Travis McMichael, Elizabeth Holmes, and Potter herself. While some, like Rittenhouse, have been acquitted, others, like Smollett, have been convicted.

Studies on defendant testimony are rare, but one study found that 77% of testifying defendants were convicted compared to 72% who did not testify. However, the study also found that defendants with no or minimal criminal records were more likely to testify, potentially due to less risk of exposing a criminal history.

Testifying offers defendants a chance to convey their state of mind, especially crucial in self-defense claims. However, it also comes with the risk of cross-examination, where prosecutors can exploit inconsistencies or admissions.

"Prosecutors are looking for any opportunity to discredit the defendant," said Turner. "They will try to catch them in a lie or get them to admit something that can be used against them."

Not testifying can also be risky, as jurors may infer guilt from the defendant's silence. However, it can also be a strategic move, especially if the prosecution's case is weak.

Jussie Smollett's decision to testify in his trial for allegedly faking a hate crime was considered a disaster by observers. Smollett's testimony was full of inconsistencies and contradictions, which prosecutors used to their advantage.

"Smollett's case is a cautionary tale about the risks of defending oneself in court," said Tuerkheimer. "It's a gamble, and it doesn't always pay off."

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to testify is a complex one that depends on the specific circumstances of the case. However, the recent trend of defendants taking the stand suggests that the traditional reluctance to testify is waning. As social media continues to shape public opinion and jurors' expectations, defendants may increasingly feel the need to speak out in their own defense.
