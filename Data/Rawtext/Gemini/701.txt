MacArthur High School Student Arrested After Brandishing Gun in Locker Room

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) – A MacArthur High School student was arrested on Thursday morning after brandishing a loaded gun at another student during an argument in the gym locker room.

According to Aldine ISD, the incident occurred around 8:30 a.m. The student with the gun was immediately apprehended by school police without any shots being fired. The school was placed on secure status as a precaution, and extra Aldine ISD police officers were dispatched to the campus.

"The safety of our students and staff is our top priority," said Aldine ISD in a statement. "We will take appropriate disciplinary action in accordance with the district's student code of conduct."

The Aldine ISD Police Department is currently conducting an investigation into the incident. No further details have been released at this time.

This incident comes on the heels of a deadly school shooting in Michigan earlier this week, where 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley killed four students and injured seven others. Crumbley has been charged as an adult, while his parents face charges of involuntary manslaughter for their alleged negligence.

On the same day as the Michigan shooting, another student at Cinco Ranch High School was found with a gun on campus, as reported by Principal James Cross. The student was immediately removed from class, and the school was placed on lockdown.

These incidents have heightened concerns over school safety and gun control. Many are calling for stricter gun laws and increased mental health support for students.

"We need to do more to protect our children," said one parent. "We can't afford to have any more tragedies like this."

The Aldine ISD Police Department is asking anyone with information about the incident at MacArthur High School to contact them at (281) 985-6800.
