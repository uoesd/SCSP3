Colonial Pipeline Resumes Operations After Cyberattack, Fuel Shortages to Persist

CLEMMONS, N.C. (AP) – The Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, resumed operations on Wednesday after a six-day shutdown caused by a cyberattack, bringing relief to motorists and businesses across the Southeast.

The shutdown, which began on Friday, led to widespread gas shortages, panic-buying, and long lines at gas stations across the region. According to AAA, over half of the gas stations in North Carolina and about half in Georgia and Virginia ran out of fuel.

"It's been a nightmare," said Jeanette McGee, a spokeswoman for the AAA auto club. "People have been driving all over the place, trying to find gas."

The cyberattack did not allow hackers to control pipeline operations, but it forced Colonial Pipeline to shut down the system to contain the damage. The company said it will take several days for fuel deliveries to normalize.

"We're working around the clock to get the pipeline back to full capacity," said Colonial Pipeline spokesman Steve Baker. "We appreciate the patience of our customers and the public."

The restart of the pipeline is expected to address the transportation issue affecting fuel supply to gas stations. However, experts warn that it will take some time for the situation to stabilize.

"It's going to take a few days for the supply chain to catch up," said Ryan McNutt, CEO of the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America. "We're asking motorists to be patient and not to panic-buy."

The fuel disruption occurred as Americans are becoming more mobile, especially with pandemic restrictions easing. The increased demand for gasoline, coupled with the pipeline shutdown, has led to a spike in prices.

"The national average price for a gallon of gasoline surpassed $3 for the first time since 2016," said Jeff Lenard, a spokesman for the National Association of Convenience Stores. "We're urging consumers to shop around for the best prices."

The fuel shortage has also had a ripple effect on other industries. Construction worker and Uber Eats driver Jamar Gatison said he has been struggling to find gas for his vehicles.

"I've been driving all over the place, trying to find gas," Gatison said. "It's been really frustrating."

Ron Brown, operator of Ron's Appalachian Trail Shuttles, said he has had to cancel trips due to the fuel shortage.

"I've had to turn away customers because I don't have enough gas to get them to their destinations," Brown said.

Mary Goldburg, a T-shirt and promotional products deliverer, said she has been forced to pay higher prices for gas.

"I've had to pay as much as $4 a gallon," Goldburg said. "It's really cutting into my profits."

Amid the fuel shortage, there have been reports of violence and price gouging. In North Carolina, a man was arrested for allegedly assaulting a gas station employee over a dispute about fuel prices.

Several U.S. agencies have relaxed rules to expedite fuel transport via trucks, trains, and ships, despite a national trucker shortage. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has granted a temporary waiver of hours-of-service regulations for truck drivers transporting fuel.

"We're doing everything we can to get fuel to where it's needed," said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. "We're asking the public to be patient and to avoid panic-buying."

Experts say the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack is a reminder of the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber threats.

"This attack shows that we need to be better prepared for cyberattacks on our energy infrastructure," said David Kennedy, a cybersecurity expert at TrustedSec. "We need to invest in cybersecurity and develop contingency plans to deal with these types of events."
