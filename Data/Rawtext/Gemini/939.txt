Impeachment Proceedings Against Trump Advance Amid Capitol Siege Fallout

WASHINGTON (AP) – Democrats in Congress are swiftly moving forward with impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, accusing him of inciting the deadly Capitol siege last week. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasized the need for immediate action against an "unhinged" president, while Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski and others have criticized Trump, with Murkowski calling for his resignation.

"We must act now to prevent further violence and protect our democracy," Pelosi said in a statement. "The president's actions have been a clear and present danger to our country."

The draft impeachment articles, released by the House Judiciary Committee on Monday, accuse Trump of abuse of power related to the Capitol siege. The articles allege that Trump "incited an insurrection" by encouraging his supporters to march on the Capitol and "fight like hell" to overturn the results of the election.

"The president's conduct was a clear and present danger to our democratic institutions," said Democratic Representative Adam Schiff of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. "He must be held accountable."

The House is expected to vote on the impeachment articles as early as Wednesday. If Trump is impeached, he will become the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice.

Trump has promised a smooth transfer of power but will not attend Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday, a rare presidential snub. In a statement, Trump said he would "not be attending the Inauguration on January 20th."

Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have also considered invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, though this seems unlikely following the resignation of several Cabinet members, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.

"The president is unhinged and unfit to hold office," Pelosi said. "We must do everything in our power to prevent him from doing further damage to our country."

Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has been one of the most outspoken critics of Trump within her party. She called for Trump's resignation on Sunday, saying that he "has committed an impeachable offense."

"The president's actions have been a betrayal of his oath of office and a betrayal of our country," Murkowski said. "He must be held accountable."

Other Republicans have also criticized Trump, but few have gone as far as Murkowski in calling for his resignation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that he will not bring an impeachment trial to the Senate before Biden takes office.

"The president's actions were reckless and dangerous," said Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. "He must be held accountable for his role in inciting this violence."

The impeachment proceedings come as the country grapples with the aftermath of the Capitol siege. Five people died in the attack, including a Capitol Police officer. The FBI is investigating the attack as a domestic terrorism incident.

"The president's actions have put our democracy in jeopardy," said General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "We must do everything in our power to prevent further violence and protect our country."

The White House has criticized the impeachment efforts as divisive.

"This impeachment is a dangerous attack on our democracy," said White House spokesman Judd Deere. "The president has done nothing wrong, and he will not be intimidated by this partisan attack."

Twitter has permanently suspended Trump's account, citing "risk of further incitement of violence." The company said that Trump's tweets "violated the Twitter Rules on glorifying violence."

The impeachment proceedings against Trump are likely to be highly contentious. Republicans are divided on whether to support impeachment, and some have argued that it would be too divisive. Democrats, however, believe that it is necessary to hold Trump accountable for his actions.

"The president has committed a grave offense against our country," Pelosi said. "We must act now to prevent further violence and protect our democracy."
