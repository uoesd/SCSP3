Tiger Woods Suffers Serious Injuries in Rollover Crash

Los Angeles, CA - Golf legend Tiger Woods was involved in a serious rollover car crash on Tuesday, February 23, sustaining significant orthopaedic injuries to his right lower extremity.

According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Woods' SUV collided with a median, crossed into oncoming traffic, and rolled over several times. Sheriff Alex Villaneuva stated that the vehicle was traveling at a greater speed than normal.

Woods was extricated from his vehicle using tools rather than the 'jaws of life', according to Sheriff's deputy Carlos Gonzalez. He was then transported to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he underwent a long surgical procedure.

Dr. Anish Mahajan, chief medical officer and interim CEO of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, said Woods suffered "significant orthopaedic injuries to his right lower extremity." The injuries were treated with a rod in the tibia and stabilization of foot and ankle with screws and pins.

"Mr. Woods was in good spirits and spoke to his family," Dr. Mahajan said. "We anticipate a long recovery and rehabilitation process."

Fire chief Daryl Osby said Woods was "conscious and breathing" when firefighters arrived at the scene.

Woods has undergone five back surgeries since 2014 and had hoped to return to golf in 2021. The extent of his injuries and the impact they will have on his career are still unknown.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is investigating the cause of the crash. No charges have been filed at this time.

Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, released a statement saying, "Tiger and his family want to thank the wonderful people at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and the Fire Department for their immediate and expert care. They also want to thank the many people who have sent well wishes and support."

Woods' crash has sent shockwaves through the golf world and beyond. Many have expressed their concern and support for the 15-time major champion.

"Tiger is a true champion and a great friend," said Rory McIlroy. "My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family during this difficult time."

"Tiger is a fighter," said Phil Mickelson. "He has overcome so much in his life and I know he will come back from this."

The golf world and beyond will be watching closely as Woods recovers from his injuries and begins the long road to rehabilitation.
