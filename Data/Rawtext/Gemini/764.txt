Fatal Shooting on 'Rust' Film Set Raises Questions About On-Set Gun Safety

Santa Fe, New Mexico - A tragic incident on the set of the Western film "Rust" has left one person dead and another injured, sparking concerns about on-set gun safety protocols and working conditions.

On Thursday, October 21, 2021, actor Alec Baldwin discharged a prop gun during a rehearsal, fatally striking cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. According to witnesses, the incident occurred after a camera crew walked off the set to protest safety conditions, including concerns over gun safety.

Assistant Director's Fatal Mistake

Assistant director Dave Halls handed Baldwin the gun, mistakenly indicating it was safe by declaring it a "cold gun," a term used to indicate that the weapon is unloaded. However, the gun contained a live round, which was fired when Baldwin pulled the trigger.

Ongoing Safety Disputes

Disputes over safety, accommodations, and production conditions had been ongoing since the start of filming. Script supervisor Mamie Mitchell stated that the crew had raised concerns about gun safety, including the use of real guns instead of prop guns.

"There were safety issues that were not addressed," Mitchell said. "It's super frustrating to have an accident like this happen."

Previous Safety Incidents

Previous accidental discharges of firearms on set had also raised concerns among crew members. Director Joel Souza, who was wounded in the shooting, had previously expressed concerns about the safety of the firearms being used.

"There were several instances where the guns were not handled properly," Souza said. "We had a meeting about it, and they said they would take care of it."

Tragic Rehearsal

The shooting occurred during a rehearsal, with one live round killing Hutchins and wounding Souza. Hutchins was airlifted to the University of New Mexico Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Souza was taken to Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center, where he is in stable condition.

Workplace Safety Investigation

New Mexico workplace safety investigators are reviewing the incident and gun safety protocols. The Santa Fe-area District Attorney, Mary Carmack-Altwies, has stated that the investigation is ongoing and that no charges have been filed at this time.

"We are investigating the facts and evidence surrounding this incident," Carmack-Altwies said. "We will follow the facts wherever they lead."

Armorer's Concerns

The film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, had recently assumed her role and expressed initial nervousness about her readiness. Gutierrez had previously worked as a prop assistant on other films but had limited experience as an armorer.

"I was nervous about the lack of training and experience that I had," Gutierrez said. "I didn't feel like I was fully prepared for the job."

Production Halted

Production on "Rust" was halted following the incident, with the film industry expressing grief and calling for better safety measures. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) Local 480, which represents crew members, has called for a thorough investigation and improved safety protocols.

"This tragedy is a reminder of the importance of safety on set," said Liz Pecos, president of IATSE Local 480. "We need to make sure that every crew member has a safe working environment."

On-Set Gun Safety Protocols

The incident has reignited discussions around on-set gun safety protocols, with comparisons drawn to past on-set shootings. Industry experts have called for stricter regulations and better training for those handling firearms on set.

"We need to have clear and concise safety protocols in place," said Matthew Hutchins, Halyna Hutchins' husband. "We need to make sure that everyone on set is aware of these protocols and that they are followed."

Conclusion

The fatal shooting on the set of "Rust" has raised serious questions about on-set gun safety protocols and working conditions. As the investigation continues, the film industry is grappling with the need for improved safety measures to prevent such tragedies from happening again.
