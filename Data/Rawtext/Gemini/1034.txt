Farmers' Almanac Predicts Winter Storm for Texas, 'Frosty Flip-Flop' for Nation

For over two centuries, the Farmers' Almanac has been a trusted guide for weather predictions, farming, and gardening. Ahead of its 2022 publication, the Almanac has released its winter storm predictions, warning Texans of potential cold and snowy conditions.

"We're predicting a winter storm for Texas in late January," said Sandi Duncan, Managing Editor of the Farmers' Almanac. "It's not expected to be as severe as last year, but it's still something Texans should be prepared for."

In February 2021, the Almanac accurately predicted the Arctic outbreak that brought freezing temperatures and widespread power outages to Texas and Oklahoma. Duncan advises Texans to heed the warnings and take precautions for the upcoming winter storm.

"Last year's storm was a wake-up call for many Texans," Duncan said. "It's important to be prepared for winter weather, especially if you live in an area that's prone to extreme cold."

The Almanac predicts a "frosty flip-flop winter" for the entire country, with patterns of extreme cold and precipitation followed by milder temperatures. Texas is expected to experience a colder-than-normal winter with regular precipitation.

"We're expecting a lot of ups and downs this winter," Duncan said. "There will be periods of extreme cold, but there will also be periods of milder weather."

The Almanac's predictions are based on a 200-year-old formula that has been refined over time. The formula is known only to one anonymous employee, known as the "Prognosticator."

While the Farmers' Almanac has a history of accurate predictions, Duncan emphasizes the inherent uncertainty of weather forecasting.

"Weather forecasting is not an exact science," Duncan said. "Our predictions are based on historical data and our formula, but there's always the possibility of surprises."

Despite the uncertainty, the Farmers' Almanac remains a popular resource for those planning vacations and weddings. The Almanac offers weather predictions to aid in planning, helping people avoid potential weather-related disruptions.

"We're here to help people plan their lives," Duncan said. "Our predictions can help people make informed decisions about when to travel, when to plant their gardens, and how to prepare for winter weather."
