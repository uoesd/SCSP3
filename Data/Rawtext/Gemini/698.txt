Tragedy in Oxford: Four Students Killed in High School Shooting

Oxford, Michigan - A horrific shooting at Oxford High School on Tuesday has left four students dead and seven others injured, sending shockwaves through the community and the nation.

The suspect, 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, has been charged with 24 crimes, including terrorism causing death, in connection with the attack.

According to investigators, digital evidence suggests that Crumbley planned the attack, including a video and journal detailing his intent. A social media post showed the gun used in the attack, purchased four days before the incident.

Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald insists that charging Crumbley as an adult is essential for justice. "This is not a child who made a mistake," she said. "This is a cold, calculated murderer."

McDonald highlighted the trauma experienced by surviving students as a reason for serious charges. "These students will never be the same," she said. "They witnessed unspeakable horror."

The shooting began when Crumbley emerged from a bathroom with a gun and began firing in the hallway. Senior Mitchell Williams described the event as "horrific," underlining the confusion and fear during the shooting.

"It was chaos," Williams said. "We didn't know what was happening or who was shooting."

Austin Witt, a senior at Oxford High, remembers victim Tate Myre as the "heart and soul" of their community. "He was always there for everyone," Witt said. "He was the kind of person who would always make you smile."

The community is mourning the loss and grappling with the impact of the tragedy. Schools in the area have been closed, and counseling services are being provided to students and staff.

"This is a devastating loss for our community," said Oxford Community Schools Superintendent Tim Throne. "Our hearts are broken for the families of the victims and for all those affected by this tragedy."

The investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and authorities are working to determine the motive behind the attack. The community is coming together to support the victims and their families during this difficult time.
