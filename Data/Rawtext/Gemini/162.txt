Donald Rumsfeld, Former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Dies at 88

Washington, D.C. - Donald Rumsfeld, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense who oversaw the military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, passed away on Wednesday, June 29, 2023, at the age of 88.

Rumsfeld's death was confirmed by his family, who stated that he had been battling multiple myeloma for several years.

"It is with deep sadness that we share the news of the passing of Donald Rumsfeld, an American statesman and a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather," the family said in a statement. "At 88, he was surrounded by his loving family and passed away peacefully."

Rumsfeld's career was marked by his service in the George W. Bush administration, where he played a pivotal role in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He served as the U.S. Secretary of Defense twice, first under President Gerald Ford from 1975 to 1977 and then under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2006.

During his second tenure as Secretary of Defense, Rumsfeld was responsible for managing the military conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was a staunch advocate for the invasion of Iraq in 2003, arguing that it was necessary to remove Saddam Hussein from power and prevent him from developing weapons of mass destruction.

However, the war in Iraq proved to be a controversial and costly endeavor, and Rumsfeld faced criticism for the handling of the conflict, including the search for weapons of mass destruction and reports of detainee abuses.

After leaving politics, Rumsfeld focused on various projects, including writing a memoir, participating in a documentary, and launching a mobile game. He remained a controversial figure, but he maintained that removing Saddam Hussein from power was justified, despite later admissions of faulty intelligence.

President George W. Bush remembered Rumsfeld for his service and dedication following the attacks on September 11, 2001.

"Don Rumsfeld was a man of indomitable will and unyielding determination," Bush said in a statement. "He dedicated his life to public service, and he never shied away from tough decisions. He was a true patriot, and I am grateful for his friendship."

Documentarian Errol Morris, who spent 33 hours interviewing Rumsfeld for a documentary, described him as somewhat "clueless."

"He was a very intelligent man, but he was also very clueless," Morris said. "He didn't seem to understand the consequences of his actions."

The Rumsfeld family highlighted his love for his wife, family, friends, and his dedication to public service in their statement announcing his death.

"He was a man of integrity and honor, and he will be deeply missed," the family said.
