'Finding Freedom' Epilogue: Royal Family Addresses Racism Allegations, Challenges Title Narrative

The updated epilogue of the controversial biography "Finding Freedom" has shed new light on the allegations of racism within the Royal Family made by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The book, which was originally published in 2020, now includes a revised chapter that addresses the couple's claims.

According to the epilogue, the Royal Family has challenged the narrative that Harry and Meghan did not want their son, Archie, to have a prince title. The book claims that the couple actually desired the option for Archie to have the title if they chose, but were denied by the palace.

Meghan has described her infamous Oprah interview as "cathartic" and "liberating." A friend of the Duchess alleges that the Royal Family has shown little accountability for the allegations made during the interview. The book also criticizes the family's handling of racism allegations compared to their response to bullying claims against Meghan.

The epilogue reveals that Harry and Meghan faced financial struggles before their departure from royal duties. The couple reportedly had to rely on financial assistance from Prince Charles until they were able to secure their own income. Harry was also "deeply saddened" by not being allowed to have a wreath laid in his name during Remembrance Sunday.

Despite the ongoing tensions, the book suggests that there is hope for healing through dialogue. Harry has maintained communication with his brother William, while being on "light speaking terms" with his father, Prince Charles. Feelings within the Royal Family remain "raw" post-Oprah interview, but the book emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the Sussexes' experiences for progress.
