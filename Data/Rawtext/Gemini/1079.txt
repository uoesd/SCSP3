Missing Florida Woman's Boyfriend Returns Home Without Her, Refuses to Cooperate with Investigation

North Port, Florida - A 22-year-old Florida woman, Gabby Petito, has been reported missing after embarking on a cross-country trip with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie. Laundrie has since returned to his family's home in North Port, but he is not cooperating with the investigation into Petito's disappearance.

"We are actively investigating the disappearance of Gabrielle Petito," said Josh Taylor, a spokesperson for the North Port Police Department. "We are working with multiple agencies, including the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office, the FBI, and the Suffolk County Police Department in New York, where Gabby is from."

Petito and Laundrie left New York in July for a cross-country trip in a white Ford Transit van. They documented their travels on social media, with the last post from Gabby appearing on August 25.

Gabby's last known contact with her family was on August 25, during a Facetime call with her mother, Nicole Schmidt. Schmidt said her daughter seemed "happy and fine" during the call.

"She was excited about the trip," Schmidt said. "She was loving life."

However, on September 1, Laundrie returned to his family's home in North Port without Petito. The van was also located at the residence.

"We have spoken to Brian Laundrie," Taylor said. "He is not cooperating with the investigation at this time."

Steven P. Bertolino, P.C., a legal representative for Laundrie, released a statement on behalf of the family:

"This is understandably an extremely difficult time for both the Petito family and the Laundrie family. On behalf of the Laundrie family, it is our hope that the search for Miss Petito is successful and that Miss Petito is reunited with her family. The Laundrie family is remaining in the background at this juncture and will have no further comment."

Petito's family is urging Laundrie to provide information on Gabby's last known location and why he returned alone.

"We just want to know where Gabby is," Schmidt said. "We just want her to come home."

Investigators have searched the van and found no obvious signs of foul play. However, the investigation is ongoing.

"We are following up on every lead," Taylor said. "We are committed to finding Gabby and bringing her home safely."

The North Port Police Department has set up a tip line for anyone with information on Petito's disappearance. The number is (941) 429-7382.
