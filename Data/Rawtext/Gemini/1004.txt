MyPillow USA Account Banned by Twitter for Violating Evasion Policy

Twitter has permanently suspended the MyPillow USA account for violating its ban evasion policy, a week after the personal account of CEO Mike Lindell was banned.

Lindell, a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, has repeatedly made unfounded claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged. Twitter cited these claims as the reason for suspending Lindell's personal account.

Cached tweets show that Lindell used the MyPillow account to circumvent his personal suspension. The tweets from the MyPillow account echoed Lindell's claims about election fraud and accused Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey of being involved in the alleged rigging.

Twitter's ban evasion policy prohibits suspended users from operating other accounts to get around the ban. The company has taken a strict stance against ban evasion, particularly in the wake of the January 6th Capitol storming.

Lindell expressed disbelief over the suspension, stating that it was an attempt to destroy him. "They're trying to destroy me," Lindell said in a video posted on FrankSpeech.com, a social media platform popular among conservatives.

The suspension of the MyPillow account comes as several major retailers, including Kohl's, Bed Bath & Beyond, and J.C. Penney, have ceased selling MyPillow products due to a sales slowdown. The company has also faced legal challenges, with Dominion Voting Systems considering litigation against Lindell for his claims about their machines and election fraud.

Twitter has banned over 70,000 accounts for misinformation after the Capitol storming, including Trump's account. The company has stated that it will continue to take action against accounts that violate its policies, including those that spread false or misleading information about elections.

Background on Mike Lindell and MyPillow

Conclusion

Twitter has taken a strong stance against ban evasion, and the suspension of MyPillow's account sends a clear message that the company will not tolerate users who attempt to circumvent its policies.
