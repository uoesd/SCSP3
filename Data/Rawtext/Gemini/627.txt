Ketanji Brown Jackson Confirmed to D.C. Circuit, Seen as Potential Supreme Court Nominee

WASHINGTON, June 14 – The U.S. Senate on Tuesday confirmed federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, a move that positions her as a potential nominee to the Supreme Court.

The vote was 53-44, with all opposition coming from Republicans. Three Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitt Romney of Utah – voted with Democrats.

President Joe Biden nominated Jackson to the D.C. Circuit, a common precursor to Supreme Court appointment. She replaces Attorney General Merrick Garland, who was appointed to the Supreme Court by Biden in 2021.

Jackson, 50, was previously appointed to her district court position by former President Barack Obama in 2013. She is a graduate of Harvard Law School and once clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer.

During her confirmation hearing, Jackson refuted the idea that race plays a role in her judicial decisions. She said, "I am committed to upholding the Constitution and the rule of law, and I will do so without fear or favor."

Democrats currently have control of the Senate, which is split 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris available for tie-breaking votes. Liberal activists have urged Breyer, the Supreme Court's oldest liberal justice, to retire while Democrats hold the Senate.

Jackson and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger are viewed as front-runners for a Supreme Court nomination if Breyer retires.

Jackson's confirmation is a historic moment, as she is the first Black woman to serve on the D.C. Circuit. If she is nominated to the Supreme Court, she would be the first Black woman to serve on the nation's highest court.

Her confirmation is also a victory for Biden, who has made diversity a priority in his judicial appointments. Biden has appointed more women and people of color to the federal judiciary than any other president in history.

Jackson's confirmation is a reminder of the importance of the federal judiciary. The courts play a vital role in protecting our rights and ensuring that the government follows the law.
