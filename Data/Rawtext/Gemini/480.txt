Handcuffed Ukrainian Couple Breaks Up After 123 Days

KYIV (Reuters) – A Ukrainian couple who handcuffed themselves together for 123 days as a last-ditch effort to save their relationship have finally called it quits.

Viktoria Pustovitova, a 29-year-old beautician, and Alexandr Kudlay, a 33-year-old car salesman, began their unusual experiment on Valentine's Day. They hoped that spending every waking moment together would reignite the spark in their intermittently failing relationship.

The couple documented their journey on social media, gaining a significant following. They shared videos and photos of themselves doing everything together, from brushing their teeth to sleeping.

However, the constant proximity proved to be too much for Pustovitova. "It was very difficult emotionally," she said. "I missed having my own personal space. I felt neglected despite being so close to him."

Kudlay, too, realized that the experiment had not worked as intended. "We learned that we are not well-matched as a couple," he said. "We have different values and goals."

The couple decided to auction the handcuffs and donate part of the proceeds to charity. Their separation was made official in a public event attended by Ukrainian TV news channels and a record book representative.

No other couple is known to have remained handcuffed together for as long a period. Their final Instagram post depicted them standing apart, signaling the end of their unique journey together.

"It was an interesting experience," Pustovitova said. "But I'm glad it's over. I've learned a lot about myself and what I want in a relationship."

Kudlay echoed her sentiments. "I wish Viktoria all the best," he said. "I hope she finds happiness."

The couple's breakup serves as a reminder that even the most extreme measures cannot always save a failing relationship. Sometimes, it is better to accept that it is time to move on.
