Harry and Meghan Honor MLK Day with Lunch for Mission Continues Volunteers

On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle honored the legacy of the civil rights icon by providing lunch for volunteers of The Mission Continues. The couple expressed their gratitude and recognition of Dr. King's impact in a heartfelt message.

"Today, we honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a man who dedicated his life to fighting for equality, justice, and freedom," Harry and Meghan wrote. "His legacy continues to inspire us all to work towards a better future."

The couple's support for The Mission Continues is not new. In November, they joined the organization in distributing food to families in need. This time, lunch for the volunteers was organized by Homegirl Catering, a part of Homeboy Industries.

Harry and Meghan have a long-standing relationship with Homeboy Industries, having visited the organization in 2020 to help prepare food for the #FeedHOPE program amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Father Greg Boyle, the founder of Homeboy Industries, praised the couple for their hands-on help and kinship with the workers.

"Harry and Meghan are not just celebrities who show up for a photo op," Boyle said. "They are people who genuinely care about the work we do and the people we serve."

The Mission Continues expressed its appreciation for the support from Harry, Meghan, and their Archewell Foundation on Instagram. "Thank you to Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and Archewell Foundation for providing lunch for our volunteers on Martin Luther King Jr. Day," the organization wrote. "Your support means so much to us and to the communities we serve."

The food support took place over the holiday weekend, marking the couple's ongoing commitment to community service. Harry has consistently participated in charity works, including a notable visit to The Mission Continues' base in Compton.

In their message, Harry and Meghan signed their names with their Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles, a testament to their continued involvement in royal duties despite stepping back from their senior roles.

"We are honored to continue Dr. King's legacy of service and to work alongside The Mission Continues and Homeboy Industries to create a more just and equitable world," they concluded.
