CNN Anchor Chris Cuomo Silent on Brother's Misdemeanor Sex Crime Charge

CNN anchor Chris Cuomo has remained silent on his brother Andrew Cuomo's recent misdemeanor sex crime charge, despite the former New York Governor's high-profile status and the seriousness of the allegations.

Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in August following a report by Attorney General Letitia James detailing sexual harassment allegations from 11 women, was charged with a misdemeanor based on an incident from December 2020. The charge involves forcible touching, defined as touching intimate parts for the purpose of abuse or sexual gratification.

"The charge against Mr. Cuomo is based on a thorough investigation by the Albany County Sheriff's Office," said a spokesperson for the New York State Court. "We believe the evidence will show that Mr. Cuomo committed the crime charged."

Chris Cuomo, who was reporting from Vatican City at the time of the charge, has not mentioned the incident on his show. Instead, he has focused on other news, such as Capitol Hill's infighting and the Alec Baldwin shooting incident.

A spokesman for Andrew Cuomo criticized the charge as politically motivated, especially targeting New York Attorney General Letitia James. "This is a politically motivated charge that is part of a larger effort to destroy Andrew Cuomo," said the spokesman. "We are confident that Andrew will be exonerated."

Chris Cuomo has previously addressed his brother's scandal, stating his inability to be objective and his efforts to support his brother. "I have a brother who is facing serious allegations," Chris Cuomo said. "I love my brother, but I cannot be objective about this situation."

CNN has policies that prevent Chris Cuomo from reporting on his brother, which Chris mentioned will remain in effect. "I will not be covering my brother's situation on CNN," Chris Cuomo said. "I will continue to do my job as a journalist and report on the news."

Chris Cuomo has faced criticism for receiving COVID testing from his brother's administration and assisting in his brother's defense strategy. He has also been accused of sexual harassment by TV producer Shelley Ross, relating to an incident in 2005.

"Chris Cuomo sexually harassed me," Ross said. "He put his hand on my butt and made inappropriate comments."

Chris Cuomo has denied the allegations. "I never sexually harassed Shelley Ross," Chris Cuomo said. "I have always treated her with respect."

The allegations against Chris Cuomo and his brother have raised questions about the ethics of journalists covering their family members. Some critics argue that Chris Cuomo should not be reporting on his brother's situation, while others defend his right to do so.

"Chris Cuomo has a right to report on his brother's situation," said media ethicist Ken Paulson. "However, he must be careful to avoid any conflicts of interest."

The situation involving Chris Cuomo and his brother is a complex one, with no easy answers. It raises important questions about the ethics of journalism and the role of family in the workplace.
