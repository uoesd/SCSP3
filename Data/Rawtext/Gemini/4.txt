Biden Inaugurated as 46th President, Calls for Unity and Renewal

WASHINGTON (AP) – Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday, delivering an inaugural address that emphasized the triumph of democracy and called for unity in a deeply divided nation.

"Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy," Biden said in his speech on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. "The will of the people has been heard, and the will of the people has prevailed."

Biden's inauguration took place with heightened security and no crowds due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the recent siege of the Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump. Over 200,000 American flags were planted on the National Mall to represent those who couldn't attend the inauguration in person.

In his speech, Biden indirectly rebuked Trump, who skipped the inauguration and became the first president in over a century to decline to attend the swearing-in of his successor. Biden focused on democracy, unity, and the challenges America faces, including the COVID-19 pandemic, economic strain, and racial injustice.

"We have learned again that democracy is precious," Biden said. "Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed."

Biden also called for unity, saying, "We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes."

On his first day in office, Biden signed a series of executive actions, including rejoining the Paris Climate Accords and instituting a mask mandate on federal property. He also sent an immigration bill to Congress that would provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

Former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama attended the inauguration, highlighting bipartisan support for Biden.

Biden enters office with a plan for an ambitious first 100 days, focusing on combating the pandemic and providing economic relief. He has pledged to distribute 100 million COVID-19 vaccines in his first 100 days and to provide $1.9 trillion in economic stimulus.

The inauguration ceremony included performances by Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, and Garth Brooks, with a focus on national unity and healing.

The absence of crowds and the presence of a large security force marked this as an unusual inauguration. But Biden's message of unity and renewal resonated with many Americans who are eager to move forward from the divisions of the past four years.

In his inaugural address, Biden quoted St. Augustine, saying, "A people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both." He added, "My fellow Americans, we have a chance to write a new chapter in our great American story. Let's begin that journey together."

Biden also spoke about the need to address the economic challenges facing the nation. He said, "We need to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. We need to create jobs that pay good wages and provide good benefits. We need to make sure that every American has a fair shot at success."
