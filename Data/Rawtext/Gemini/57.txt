Interior Department to Face Scrutiny Over Jan. 6 Riot Response

Washington, D.C. - The Interior Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) will launch an investigation into the department's role before and during the January 6 Capitol riot, coordinating with parallel probes by the inspectors general of the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Justice.

The violence on January 6, which resulted in at least five deaths, has raised concerns about security for the upcoming presidential inauguration. The Interior Department includes the National Park Service and U.S. Park Police, both of which have law enforcement responsibilities.

Representatives from the Park Police and National Park Service have not commented on the investigation. However, Kenneth Spencer, chairman of the US Park Police Fraternal Order of Police, criticized the Park Police's preparation for potential unrest.

"We were not prepared for this," Spencer said. "We had outdated equipment, heavy turnover, and difficulty retaining officers."

Speaker Nancy Pelosi has asked retired Army lieutenant general Russell Honoré to lead a review of Capitol security infrastructure. Congressional committees will also conduct oversight related to the attacks and security posture.

"We must get to the bottom of what happened on January 6th and ensure that it never happens again," Pelosi said.

There is interest in Congress for a 9/11-type commission to assess the events surrounding January 6. Such a commission would have the authority to subpoena witnesses and documents, and would likely produce a comprehensive report on the security failures that led to the riot.

The OIG investigation is expected to focus on the Interior Department's coordination with other agencies, its intelligence gathering, and its response to the riot. The investigation will also examine the department's policies and procedures for crowd control and security.

The results of the OIG investigation are expected to be released in the coming months. The findings could lead to changes in the Interior Department's security posture and its coordination with other agencies.
