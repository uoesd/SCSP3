Insurers Brace for $1 Billion Hit from Hurricane Ida Offshore Rig Damage

Sept 3 (Reuters) – Insurers are bracing for a potential $1 billion hit from physical damage to offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico caused by Hurricane Ida, according to industry sources.

The estimate, which excludes losses from production disruption, may be revised as the full extent of the damage becomes clearer. Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana on Sunday as a Category 4 storm, causing significant impact on refinery operations and disrupting the U.S. crude supply chain.

Utility disruptions in the aftermath of the storm could lead to prolonged claims reporting and payouts, sources said.

"We expect a significant number of claims from the offshore energy sector," said William Liebler, U.S. Chief Claims Officer at Marsh. "The damage to offshore rigs and platforms could be substantial."

Karen Clark & Co estimated total insured losses from Hurricane Ida in the U.S. and the Caribbean at $18 billion. CoreLogic estimated $6 billion to $9 billion in insured flood losses and $8 billion to $12 billion in wind losses in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.

Total losses could approach $30 billion after flash flooding killed at least 44 people in four Northeastern states. Significant water damage is expected in the Northeast, with the bulk of claims anticipated in the following days.

AIR Worldwide estimated $17 billion-$25 billion in insured losses from Hurricane Ida, with the majority of the losses expected in Louisiana.

"The impact of Hurricane Ida is still unfolding, and we expect to see a significant number of claims in the coming weeks and months," Liebler said. "We are working closely with our clients to help them recover from this devastating storm."
