Former Western Gunfight Actor Advocates for Enhanced Movie Set Safety After Prop Gun Injury

Robert Bradley, a former western gunfight actor who sustained a severe injury from a prop gun in 2013, is now an armorer for movies and a staunch advocate for enhanced safety measures on film sets.

Bradley's injury occurred during a staged show at Maggie Valley amusement park in North Carolina. He was shot in the leg with a slug from a shotgun, which lodged dangerously close to his femoral artery, rendering it too risky to remove.

The incident left a profound impact on Bradley, who now emphasizes the paramount importance of prohibiting live ammunition on movie sets. He currently works as an armorer on the set of "Silent Night in Algona" in Iowa, ensuring the safe handling and use of firearms.

Bradley's perspective on movie set safety has been shaped by the recent shooting incident on the set of "Rust," where actor Alec Baldwin discharged a prop gun that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza.

The "Rust" investigation is currently focusing on the actions of a rookie armorer and the assistant director who handed Baldwin the gun, assuring him it was not loaded. Bradley believes that the person responsible for this fatal error should face charges.

"It's a basic rule of gun safety that you never point a gun at anyone, loaded or not," Bradley said. "That rule should be strictly enforced on movie sets."

Bradley is closely monitoring potential safety changes on movie sets following the "Rust" incident. He believes that the industry needs to re-evaluate its practices and implement stricter protocols to prevent similar tragedies from occurring.

"We need to make sure that every person on set is properly trained and aware of the risks involved in handling firearms," Bradley said. "We can't afford to have any more accidents like this."

Bradley's advocacy for movie set safety is driven by his personal experience and his deep understanding of the potential dangers involved in working with firearms. He is committed to ensuring that all actors, crew members, and audiences are protected from harm.

"The safety of everyone on set should be the top priority," Bradley said. "We need to create a culture where safety is paramount and where accidents like the one on 'Rust' are unthinkable."

Bradley's voice adds to the growing chorus of industry professionals calling for enhanced safety measures on movie sets. His experience and expertise provide valuable insights into the challenges and solutions involved in creating a safer working environment for all.
