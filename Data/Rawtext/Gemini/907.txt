Brady Sets Sights on Overhand Lombardi Toss in Future Boat Parade

Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady has expressed his desire to improve upon his previous underhand toss of the Lombardi Trophy during a championship boat parade.

"I'm going to try to do an overhand toss next time," Brady said on the "Let's Go!" podcast hosted by Jim Gray. "I'm going to try to get a little more authority on it."

Brady's previous underhand toss, which landed in the hands of teammate Cameron Brate, went viral internationally. However, the quarterback is aiming for a more impressive display in the future.

"I think I can do better," Brady said. "I think I can get it out there a little further."

Brady's New Year's resolution reflects his light-hearted approach to both his on-field frustrations and his championship celebrations. He humorously noted that the feasibility of an overhand toss depends on his consumption of avocado tequila.

"I'm going to have to make sure I'm not too hydrated," Brady joked. "I'm going to have to make sure I'm not too dehydrated either."

Brady also mentioned receiving a warning from the NFL for smashing a Microsoft Surface Pro tablet out of frustration during a game. The NFL warned Brady that another tablet-related incident would result in a fine.

"I got a warning from the league," Brady said. "They said, 'If you do it again, you're going to get fined.'"

The incident of throwing and smashing the tablet has since become a Twitter meme. Brady's comments suggest that he is taking the warning in stride and maintaining a sense of humor about his on-field frustrations.

"I'm just trying to do my job," Brady said. "I'm trying to win football games. Sometimes, things don't go your way. You've got to let it go."

Brady's light-hearted approach to both his on-field frustrations and his championship celebrations is a testament to his resilience and his ability to find joy in the game of football.
