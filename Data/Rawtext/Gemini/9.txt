Biden Inaugurated as 46th US President Amid Historic Ceremony

Washington, DC - Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday, becoming the oldest person to assume the office in American history.

Biden took the oath of office on the steps of the US Capitol, using a family heirloom Bible that has been in his family for over a century. In his inaugural address, he pledged to "preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."

The ceremony was scaled back due to the COVID-19 pandemic and security concerns following the January 6 Capitol siege. The National Mall was filled with nearly 200,000 flags and 56 pillars of light to represent US states and territories, instead of the usual crowds.

Donald Trump broke with tradition by not attending Biden's inauguration, nor meeting with him before he left office. Top Republicans and former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton attended the ceremony, while Jimmy Carter abstained due to COVID-19 concerns.

Kamala Harris made history as the first Black, first woman, and first Asian American vice president. She was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, using two Bibles including one owned by Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Supreme Court Justice.

The inauguration took place during a tumultuous time of political divide, economic turmoil, and a devastating pandemic. Biden has pledged to unite the country and address these challenges, including the COVID-19 crisis, racial injustice, and climate change.

Thousands of National Guard troops were deployed to Washington, DC to provide security following the Capitol siege. The FBI had warned of potential violence at the inauguration, but the event proceeded peacefully.

The inauguration marked a historic moment in American history, as the country welcomed its first female and minority vice president and a president who has pledged to restore unity and heal the nation's divisions.
