National Guard Deployed to Washington D.C. for Inauguration Security Amid Inconsistent Pre-Riot Intelligence

WASHINGTON – Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy has revealed that pre-riot intelligence regarding the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was inconsistent, with crowd size estimates varying significantly.

"The intelligence was inconsistent," McCarthy said. "We had a range of estimates from 2,000 to 80,000 people."

This inconsistency made it difficult for authorities to determine the scale of the threat and prepare an appropriate response. As a result, the National Guard has been deployed to Washington D.C. for a minimum of 30 days to support post-riot security and the upcoming presidential inauguration.

Approximately 6,200 National Guard personnel will be deployed to assist with traffic control and law enforcement, ensuring the safety of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20. This deployment follows the mobilization of approximately 1,100 National Guard troops during the Capitol riot to assist local law enforcement.

Former presidents and officials have condemned the violent events and the disruption of the electoral process on January 6. President Donald Trump, who has not conceded defeat, rallied supporters before the riot but has not condemned their actions.

Biden's inauguration plans have been altered due to COVID-19, with a focus on virtual participation to prevent the spread of the virus. Biden has condemned the riot, describing it as an assault on democracy and calling for an end to the violence.

"This was not dissent," Biden said. "It was disorder. It was chaos. It was, in fact, a siege."
