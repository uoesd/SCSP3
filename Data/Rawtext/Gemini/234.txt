Damm Halts Production at Main Brewery After Cyber Attack

MADRID, Nov 12 – Spain's second-largest beer maker, Damm, has halted production at its main brewery outside Barcelona due to a cyber attack.

The attack occurred on Tuesday night and completely paralyzed the brewery in El Prat de Llobregat for several hours. The brewery, which produces 7 million hectolitres of beer a year, was able to partially resume production with IT intervention.

"The attack affected our production systems, but we were able to partially resume production thanks to the intervention of our IT team," said Olga Vidal, Damm's head of communications.

Vidal did not disclose if a ransom was demanded or paid to the hackers. The company's notification to the police about the attack is unconfirmed.

Despite the halt in production, Damm has fulfilled all deliveries using existing stocks. The company produces several beer brands, including the iconic Estrella Damm lager.

Recent high-profile cyber attacks have led to increased scrutiny of security policies by governments and companies worldwide. A European Union report highlighted the rise in cyber-criminal activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Autonomous University of Barcelona and Spain's employment agency were also victims of ransomware attacks recently.

"Cyber attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent," said Vidal. "Companies need to invest in robust security measures to protect their operations."

The cyber attack on Damm serves as a reminder of the growing threat posed by cybercriminals. Companies and governments must prioritize cybersecurity to mitigate the risks and protect their critical infrastructure.
