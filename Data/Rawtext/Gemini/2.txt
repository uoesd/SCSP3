Biden's Inauguration: Fact-Checking Crowd Size, Security, and Misinformation

The inauguration of President Joe Biden on January 20, 2021, was a historic event marked by unprecedented limitations due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and recent security threats.

Crowd Size and COVID-19 Precautions

Unlike previous inaugurations, which typically draw massive crowds to the National Mall, Biden's ceremony was scaled back to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Attendance was strictly limited, with attendees required to wear masks and maintain social distancing. The National Mall was closed to the public, and the parade route was significantly shortened.

Trump's Absence

In a break from tradition, former President Donald Trump did not attend Biden's inauguration. This marked the first time in over 150 years that an outgoing president had skipped his successor's inauguration.

Heightened Security

Washington D.C. was under heightened security following the January 6th pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol. Thousands of National Guard troops were deployed to the city, and security checkpoints were established throughout the downtown area.

Misinformation and False Claims

In the lead-up to the inauguration, there was a surge of misinformation and false claims circulating online. One of the most prevalent claims was that flags were added to the National Mall to make the inauguration look less empty.

Flags as Public Art

The flags on the National Mall were not intended to fill space. They were part of a public art exhibition called "The Field of Flags," which represented the Americans who were unable to attend the inauguration due to COVID-19 restrictions. Each flag represented an individual who had lost a loved one to the pandemic or who had been unable to travel to Washington D.C.

Biden's COVID-19 Precautions

Biden's inauguration maintained strict coronavirus precautions, continuing practices that had been in place throughout his presidential campaign. Attendees were required to wear masks, undergo temperature checks, and maintain social distancing. The ceremony was also held outdoors to minimize the risk of transmission.

Absence of Large Crowds

The absence of large crowds at Biden's inauguration marked a significant change from traditional inauguration ceremonies. However, it was a necessary measure to protect public health and ensure the safety of attendees.

Fact-Checking the Flag Claim

The claim that flags were used to fill space at Biden's inauguration was rated as "missing context" by fact-checking organizations. While it is true that the flags were added to the National Mall, they were part of a public art exhibition and not intended to deceive. The pandemic and security measures necessitated the scaling back of the inauguration, and the flags served as a symbolic representation of those who could not attend.

Conclusion

Biden's inauguration was a historic event that was shaped by the unprecedented challenges of the coronavirus pandemic and recent security threats. The limitations on crowd size, the absence of former President Trump, and the heightened security measures were all necessary steps to ensure the safety of attendees and the peaceful transfer of power. The misinformation surrounding the inauguration, including the false claim about the flags, underscores the importance of relying on credible sources for information.
