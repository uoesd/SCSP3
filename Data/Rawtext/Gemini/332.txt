Suez Canal Unblocked: MV Ever Given Partially Refloated

Cairo, Egypt - The massive container ship MV Ever Given, which blocked the Suez Canal for nearly a week, has been partially refloated and moved alongside the bank, according to the GAC Group.

The 193km-long Suez Canal is a crucial waterway for global trade, with about 12% of the world's trade passing through it, including oil and liquefied natural gas.

The Ever Given, leased by Evergreen Marine Corp., ran aground on Tuesday, March 23, blocking traffic in both directions. The incident was reportedly caused by poor visibility due to a dust storm and strong winds.

"The ship has been partially moved alongside the bank," said Ahmed Mekawy, Deputy Manager of the Suez Canal for the GAC Group. "Efforts to free the ship accelerated, and some traffic is expected to resume today."

Evergreen Marine Corp. has refused to pay for the salvage operation if the ship remains stuck. The company may seek compensation depending on the investigation's findings on the incident's cause.

The Ever Given is one of the largest container ships in the world, with a capacity of 20,000 containers. Evergreen leased the vessel to add cargo capacity to its East Asia to Europe operations.

The blockage of the Suez Canal has caused a major disruption to global trade, with dozens of ships left gridlocked, attempting to transit between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.

The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) has been working around the clock to free the ship, using tugboats and dredgers to remove sand and mud from around the vessel's hull.

The SCA has also been working with salvage companies to develop a plan to refloat the ship. The plan involves using a combination of tugboats and dredging to free the ship.

The refloating of the Ever Given is a major relief for the global shipping industry. The blockage of the Suez Canal has caused significant delays and disruptions to global trade.

The SCA has said that it will investigate the incident to determine the cause of the grounding. The investigation will likely focus on the weather conditions at the time of the incident and the ship's navigation systems.

The refloating of the Ever Given is a testament to the skill and dedication of the salvage crews involved in the operation. The SCA and the salvage companies worked tirelessly to free the ship and reopen the Suez Canal to traffic.
