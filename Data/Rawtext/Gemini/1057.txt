Houstonian Found Dead in Wyoming After Month-Long Search

The body of Robert 'Bob' Lowrey, a 46-year-old Houston resident, was discovered at the base of Teton Pass in Wyoming, nearly a month after he was last heard from.

Lowrey's disappearance gained significant attention due to its similarities to the widely publicized case of Gabby Petito. Public tips, influenced by the Petito case coverage, led authorities to Lowrey's last known location.

"We are grateful for the public's assistance in providing information that helped us locate Mr. Lowrey," said Teton County Search and Rescue in an official statement.

Search teams, including dog units, scoured the rugged terrain for weeks, covering over 75 miles of hiking and 22,500 feet of elevation. Lowrey's belongings were found during the search, providing crucial clues to his whereabouts.

The cause of Lowrey's death remains unclear, and an investigation is ongoing.

Lowrey's family expressed their gratitude to the media and the public for their support during this difficult time. "We appreciate the privacy and space to grieve," they said in a statement.

A GoFundMe page has been set up to support Lowrey's children's education. The family has expressed their appreciation for any level of contribution.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Lowrey's family and friends during this challenging time," said Teton County Search and Rescue. "We extend our deepest condolences for their loss."

The search for Lowrey involved a massive effort from multiple agencies, including the Teton County Sheriff's Office, Teton County Search and Rescue, the National Park Service, and volunteers.

"We are grateful to all who assisted in this search operation," said Teton County Search and Rescue. "Their dedication and tireless efforts were instrumental in locating Mr. Lowrey."

Lowrey's disappearance and subsequent discovery have highlighted the importance of public awareness and the power of community involvement in missing person cases. The widespread coverage of the Petito case has raised awareness about the issue and encouraged people to report suspicious activity.
