Hurricane Ida's Tragic Toll: First Confirmed Fatality as Storm Ravages Louisiana

Gonzales, Louisiana – Hurricane Ida's relentless fury has claimed its first confirmed victim in Dennis Duplessis, a Gonzales resident who succumbed to a fatal injury sustained during the storm.

As the Category 3 hurricane roared through Gonzales on Sunday, Duplessis attempted to step out of a truck when a massive oak tree branch crashed down, severing an artery in his leg. Despite valiant efforts to save him, Duplessis uttered his final words to his wife before succumbing to his injuries before medical help could arrive.

"He said, 'I love you, baby. I'll see you later,'" recalled his daughter, Chasity Fatherree, through tears.

Duplessis' death marks a somber milestone in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, which has left a trail of destruction and claimed dozens of lives across Louisiana. As the storm continues to unleash its wrath, communities are grappling with the loss of loved ones and the daunting task of rebuilding.

In the wake of the tragedy, volunteers from nearby churches rushed to the Duplessis residence, working tirelessly to clear the fallen tree from their front yard. The outpouring of support from the community has provided a glimmer of solace amidst the devastation.

"It's heartbreaking to lose someone so suddenly, but it's comforting to see how people come together in times like these," said Caleb Marcantel, Duplessis' nephew.

As Hurricane Ida moved inland, it maintained its formidable strength, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. Historic sites, including the Whitney Plantation in Edgard, have suffered significant damage. The plantation, a poignant museum dedicated to preserving the experiences of enslaved Africans, has seen its structures, including a church built by freed slaves and a century-old barn, severely compromised.

"It's devastating to see these historic buildings damaged," said Joy Banner, the Whitney Plantation's communications director and a descendant of enslaved Africans. "They are tangible reminders of the resilience and suffering of our ancestors."

In a testament to the community's spirit of resilience, a second large tree near the Duplessis residence was safely removed by a company free of charge, alleviating the family's worry.

"We're so grateful for the help we've received," said Crystal Marcantel, Caleb's sister-in-law and a nurse. "It's been a difficult time, but the support of our community has made it a little easier."
