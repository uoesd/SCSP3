Royals Dine at Melba's Harlem, Showcasing Support for Black-Owned Businesses and Community

In a heartwarming display of support for Black-owned businesses and the Harlem community, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, paid a visit to Melba's Harlem restaurant on Friday, following Meghan's book reading at PS 123.

Restaurateur Melba Wilson, the visionary behind Melba's Harlem, couldn't contain her delight at the royal couple's visit. "They were extremely gracious and down-to-earth," she gushed. "They made me feel like I had known them for years."

Wilson received a call about the royal visit just an hour before their arrival, with instructions not to close the restaurant for a private visit. Instead, Harry and Meghan opted to mingle with other customers, engaging with staff and patrons with genuine warmth.

"They sampled various Southern staples and contemporary dishes from our menu," Wilson shared. "They were very complimentary and seemed to enjoy the food."

The couple's approachability and genuine care left a lasting positive impression on Wilson. "They were so easy to talk to and genuinely interested in our story," she said. "It was a surreal and unforgettable experience."

Beyond their personal interactions, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a significant gesture of support by donating $25,000 to Melba's COVID-19 Employee Relief Fund via their Archewell Foundation.

"This donation is a lifeline for our employees and others facing food insecurity during this challenging time," Wilson emphasized. "It shows that they care not just about our business but about the well-being of our community."

Wilson believes the royal visit is a powerful symbol of support for Black-owned businesses and the Harlem community. "It sends a message that small businesses and communities of color matter," she said. "It's a reminder that we are all connected and that we can make a difference together."

For Wilson, giving back to her community is a deeply fulfilling endeavor. "I'm so grateful for the opportunity to serve our community and provide a space where people can come together," she said. "The royal couple's visit and support have been an incredible inspiration."

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's visit to Melba's Harlem is a testament to their commitment to supporting diverse communities and small businesses. Their actions have not only made a tangible difference in the lives of Melba's employees but have also sent a powerful message of hope and unity.
