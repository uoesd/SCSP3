Laundrie Caught Reading 'Annihilation' Novel About Missing Women

Internet sleuths have uncovered a chilling detail in the case of Gabby Petito's disappearance: her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, was seen reading Jeff VanderMeer's "Annihilation," a novel about missing women, in a video on the couple's YouTube channel.

The video, uploaded to the "Nomadik Statik" channel on August 19, shows Laundrie sitting in a chair and reading the book. The novel tells the story of four women who enter a mysterious area known as "Area X," where three of them disappear and one remains behind.

TikTok user Alyssa Rose called the video "disturbing" and suggested it should be investigated by the police. "It's like he was foreshadowing what was going to happen," she said.

However, some TikTok users believe the connection between the book and Petito's case is far-fetched. "It's just a coincidence," one user commented. "He could have been reading it for any number of reasons."

The discovery of the video comes as the FBI has likely found Petito's body in a Wyoming national park. Teton County Coroner Dr. Brent Blue confirmed the discovery of a body at Bridger-Teton National Forest. "The cause of death is still under investigation," Dr. Blue said.

The discovery of the body was deemed "heartbreaking" by Laundrie family's attorney. "The Laundrie family is still mourning the loss of their daughter, Cassie, and are now faced with another unimaginable tragedy," the attorney said.

Petito went missing last month during a trip with Laundrie, who returned home without her and then disappeared. Laundrie is currently the subject of a nationwide manhunt.

The video of Laundrie reading "Annihilation" has raised questions about his possible involvement in Petito's disappearance. The novel's themes of female disappearance and the dangers of exploring unknown territories have resonated with many who are following the case.

A 2018 movie based on the novel starred Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The film received critical acclaim for its atmospheric visuals and its exploration of the themes of loss and grief.

The discovery of Petito's body and the video of Laundrie reading "Annihilation" have added a new layer of intrigue to this already tragic case. As the investigation continues, it remains to be seen whether the novel will play any role in unraveling the mystery of Gabby Petito's disappearance.
