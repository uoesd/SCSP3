FDA Authorizes Additional COVID-19 Vaccine Dose for Immunocompromised Individuals

Washington, D.C. – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today amended the emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to allow for an additional dose for certain immunocompromised individuals.

"Today's action is an important step in ensuring that immunocompromised individuals have the best possible protection against COVID-19," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. "We are committed to continuing to work with our partners to ensure that all Americans have access to safe and effective vaccines."

Immunocompromised individuals have a reduced ability to fight infections, making them more susceptible to COVID-19. The third vaccine dose may increase protection for these individuals, but physical precautions are still recommended.

The FDA advises immunocompromised individuals to discuss monoclonal antibody treatment options for COVID-19 with their healthcare providers. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system's ability to fight off harmful pathogens.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is authorized for individuals 12 years of age and older, and the Moderna vaccine is authorized for individuals 18 years of age and older. Both vaccines require two initial shots. The third dose is approved to be given at least 28 days after the two-dose regimen to eligible individuals.

The EUA amendments were issued to Pfizer Inc. and ModernaTX Inc.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will meet on August 12-13, 2021, to discuss further recommendations for immunocompromised individuals.

"The FDA will continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines and will provide updates as needed," said Woodcock. "We encourage all Americans to get vaccinated and to take steps to protect themselves and others from COVID-19."
