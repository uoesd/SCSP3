Cuomo's Thanksgiving Tirade: Wreaths, Woke Folks, and a Plunging Prime Time

Thanksgiving, a time for family, gratitude, and reflection, took an unexpected turn this year as former CNN host Chris Cuomo aired grievances about "cancel culture" and dismissed the historical significance of the holiday.

Wreaths and Rants

On Thanksgiving Day, Cuomo was spotted loading Christmas wreaths into his Tesla in Amagansett, New York, alongside his wife, Cristina. The couple had been picking out decorations for their holiday festivities.

Later that evening, Cuomo took to his SiriusXM radio show, "Let's Get After It," to express his frustration with "woke folks" who he claimed were ruining Thanksgiving.

"Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday," Cuomo declared. "It's a day to be with family, to eat good food, and to be thankful for what we have. But now, the woke folks are trying to ruin it for everyone."

Dismissing History

Cuomo's rant targeted those who criticized the historical context of Thanksgiving, arguing that it should be a day of celebration rather than dwelling on the past.

"I don't care about the pilgrims or the indigenous peoples," Cuomo said. "I care about my family and my friends. I care about being thankful for what I have."

Brotherly Contrast

Cuomo's Thanksgiving outburst stood in stark contrast to the message shared by his brother, Andrew Cuomo, the disgraced former New York Governor. Andrew Cuomo resigned in August after allegations of sexual harassment were substantiated in a report by the New York Attorney General.

On Thanksgiving Day, Andrew Cuomo posted a message on Twitter expressing gratitude for his family and friends. He also acknowledged the challenges faced by many during the pandemic and encouraged unity.

Ratings Woes

Chris Cuomo's primetime CNN show has hit an all-time low in ratings this month, according to Nielsen Media Research. Cuomo's show drew 684,000 total average viewers last week, a significant drop from its debut in June 2018.

Despite the decline, "Cuomo Prime Time" remains CNN's highest-rated show as of August. However, Cuomo's popularity has waned following his brother's resignation amid sexual misconduct allegations.

Waning Popularity

Cuomo's Thanksgiving rant has further eroded his public image. Critics have accused him of being out of touch with the concerns of many Americans and of using his platform to promote a divisive agenda.

The former CNN host has faced criticism for his handling of the sexual harassment allegations against his brother. He has been accused of using his influence to protect Andrew Cuomo and of downplaying the seriousness of the allegations.

Conclusion

Chris Cuomo's Thanksgiving tirade has exposed a growing disconnect between the former CNN host and the public. His dismissal of the historical significance of the holiday and his attacks on "woke folks" have alienated many viewers.

As Cuomo's ratings continue to decline, it remains to be seen whether he can regain the trust of his audience and salvage his once-promising career.
