Harris' Team Turmoil: Senior Aides Depart, Raising Questions About Stability

CNN – Vice President Kamala Harris has lost two senior aides in recent weeks, raising questions about the stability of her team and her ability to navigate the challenges of her historic role.

Ashley Etienne, Harris' communications director, and Symone Sanders, her senior adviser and chief spokesperson, both announced their departures in early December. The White House has described the exits as long-planned and not indicative of any internal issues.

"These are two individuals who have served the vice president with distinction, and we wish them well in their future endeavors," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.

However, some observers have expressed concern that the departures of two such senior aides could signal deeper problems within Harris' team.

"It's hard to lose two senior aides at the same time and not have it raise questions about what's going on," said Mark Z. Barabak, a political reporter for the Los Angeles Times.

Harris has faced intense scrutiny since taking office, becoming the target of both political opponents and some within her own party. Critics have argued that she is being held to an unfair standard due to her historic role as the first woman and first person of color to serve as vice president.

"She's the first woman, the first Black woman, the first South Asian woman to hold this office," said Barabak. "And so there's a lot of pressure on her to succeed."

Reports have emerged suggesting dysfunction and a lack of focus within Harris' staff, as well as tensions with the White House. The New York Times reported that Harris has felt constrained and sidelined, impacting her political maneuverability.

"She's not able to do the things that she wants to do," said Barabak. "She's not able to have the kind of impact that she wants to have."

Past reports have also indicated issues with low morale and distrust among Harris' staff. During her time as California attorney general, several settlements were made in the California Department of Justice for harassment allegations, claims that Harris has said she was unaware of.

The vice-presidential role has been described as inherently diminishing, contributing to challenges in maintaining public and political stature.

"It's a difficult job," said Barabak. "It's a job that's often seen as a stepping stone to the presidency, but it's also a job that can be very frustrating."

Harris' struggle with staff retention is not a new issue. During her time as California attorney general, she also faced high staff turnover.

"She's had a lot of turnover in her staff," said Barabak. "And that's something that she's going to have to address if she wants to be successful in this role."

The departures of Etienne and Sanders have left a void in Harris' inner circle, and it remains to be seen how she will fill those roles and address the challenges facing her team.
