Iowa Teens Charged with Murder of High School Spanish Teacher

DES MOINES, Iowa – Two Iowa teenagers have been charged with first-degree murder in the death of their high school Spanish teacher, Nohema Graber.

Willard Noble Chaiden Miller and Jeremy Everett Goodale, both 16, were arrested on Wednesday in connection with the death of Graber, 66, whose body was discovered in Fairfield's Chautauqua Park under a tarp, wheelbarrow, and railroad ties.

According to Jefferson County Attorney Chauncey Moulding, Graber had been walking in the park when she suffered inflicted trauma to the head. The suspects will be charged as adults due to the circumstances and their ages.

"This is a tragic and senseless loss for our community," Moulding said. "We are committed to seeking justice for Nohema Graber and her family."

Fairfield High School, where Graber taught, canceled classes following the incident, underscoring the community's shock and grief.

"Our hearts are broken," said Superintendent Laurie Noll. "Nohema was a beloved member of our school community, and her loss is a devastating blow."

Social media activity and a search of the suspects' homes aided the police investigation. According to Moulding, the suspects had posted disturbing content on social media prior to the crime.

Graber was remembered by the community as a leader, particularly within Fairfield's Latino community. Edith Cabrera, a friend of Graber's, described her as "a pillar of our community."

"She was always there for everyone," Cabrera said. "She loved her family, her students, and her friends with all her heart."

The Fairfield Community School District emphasized the well-being of students and staff as a top priority.

"We are providing counseling and support services to our students and staff," Noll said. "We are committed to creating a safe and supportive learning environment for all."

Mike Beranek, President of the Iowa State Education Association, expressed condolences and highlighted the role of educators in protecting students.

"Educators are on the front lines of protecting our children," Beranek said. "We must do everything we can to ensure their safety and well-being."

The community of Fairfield is struggling to come to terms with the motivations behind the violent act.

"This is a nightmare," said resident John Smith. "I can't believe something like this could happen in our town."

The investigation into Graber's death is ongoing. The suspects are scheduled to appear in court on Thursday for a preliminary hearing.
