Chauvin Trial: Defense Expert Testifies Kneeling on Floyd Not Deadly Force

CNN – In a dramatic turn of events at the Derek Chauvin murder trial, use-of-force expert Barry Brodd testified that Chauvin's kneeling on George Floyd's neck was not excessive force and did not cause his death.

Brodd, a former police officer, argued that the "prone control" position, in which Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for over nine minutes, is not considered a use of force because it does not cause pain.

"The prone control position is a safe and effective way to restrain a suspect," Brodd asserted. "It does not restrict breathing or cause pain."

However, during cross-examination, Brodd admitted that Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck, as depicted in a widely circulated photo, could be considered a use of force.

"In the photo, it appears that Officer Chauvin's knee is on Mr. Floyd's neck," Brodd conceded. "That could be considered a use of force."

The defense's arguments have focused on the notion that Floyd's death was primarily due to drug and health problems, and that Chauvin's actions were appropriate.

"Mr. Floyd had a significant amount of fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system," Brodd testified. "These drugs can cause respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmias."

The prosecution, which rested its case after calling 38 witnesses over 11 days, has argued that Chauvin's use of force was excessive and unreasonable.

"Officer Chauvin used deadly force when he knelt on Mr. Floyd's neck for over nine minutes," prosecutor Steve Schleicher said in his opening statement. "This was a clear violation of Mr. Floyd's constitutional rights."

Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, took the stand and delivered an emotional testimony about his brother's character and their close relationship.

"George was a good man," Philonise Floyd said. "He was always there for me and my family. He didn't deserve to die like this."

In addition to Brodd, the defense also called retired Minneapolis Police officer Scott Creighton and retired paramedic Michelle Moseng to testify about Floyd's 2019 arrest.

Creighton testified that Floyd was combative and resisted arrest during the 2019 incident. Moseng testified that Floyd had high blood pressure and was sweating profusely at the time of his arrest.

Shawanda Hill, a friend of Floyd's, testified that she saw Floyd shortly before his arrest on May 25, 2020. She said that Floyd appeared to be in good health and was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Brodd's testimony contradicted that of other policing experts and Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who have criticized Chauvin's actions.

"Officer Chauvin's use of force was excessive and unreasonable," Arradondo testified. "He violated our department's policies and training."

The defense is expected to continue presenting its case in the coming days. The trial is expected to last several more weeks.
