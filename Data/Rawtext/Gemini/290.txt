Pfizer Data Suggests Third Dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Significantly Boosts Antibody Levels Against Delta Variant

New York, NY - Pfizer has released early data indicating that a third dose of its COVID-19 vaccine significantly increases antibody levels against the Delta variant compared to just two doses. The data, presented during the company's earnings call, showed that antibody levels against the Delta variant increased fivefold in people aged 18 to 55 and 11-fold in people aged 65 to 85 after a third dose.

"These data provide further evidence of the potential benefits of a third dose of our vaccine in boosting antibody levels against the Delta variant," said Dr. Mikael Dolsten, who leads worldwide research, development, and medical for Pfizer. "We believe that a third dose may be necessary to maintain high levels of protection against this variant."

The study involved tests on 23 people and the data have not been peer-reviewed or published. However, Pfizer plans to submit the data to the FDA for emergency use authorization of a third dose as early as next month.

The FDA and CDC have previously stated that Americans do not currently need a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. However, Pfizer's data may prompt a reconsideration of that stance.

"We are continuing to monitor the data on the Delta variant and will make a decision on whether or not to recommend a third dose based on the science," said Dr. Vivek Murthy, the US Surgeon General. "At this moment, we do not believe that people need a booster shot."

There are still questions about the correlation between antibody levels and real-world immunity, as well as the role of other parts of the immune system. However, Pfizer's data suggests that a third dose of its vaccine could provide a significant boost in protection against the Delta variant.

The debate over booster shots is likely to continue, with some experts arguing that they are necessary to maintain high levels of protection against the Delta variant, while others caution that they may not be necessary and could divert resources from other countries that are still struggling to vaccinate their populations.
