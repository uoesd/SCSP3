Black Friday Gun Sales Surge: Nearly 700,000 Firearms Bought Amidst Oxford High School Shooting

Black Friday, traditionally known for its retail frenzy, has taken a somber turn in recent years, becoming a day of heightened gun sales. This year, the trend continued unabated, with nearly 700,000 firearms bought or attempted to be bought during the sales period, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

On Black Friday alone, the FBI processed a record-breaking 187,585 background checks for gun purchases, the highest number ever recorded for the day. This surge in gun sales has raised concerns, particularly in light of the recent mass shooting at Oxford High School in Michigan, where the pistol used in the attack was purchased on Black Friday by the suspect's father.

The Oxford High School shooting has reignited debates over gun safety and laws in Michigan. The state ranks 20th by the Giffords Law Center for states with the strictest gun laws, but some argue that more needs to be done to prevent tragedies like the one that occurred in Oxford.

Michigan's Democratic Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has referred to gun violence as a "public health crisis." She has called for stricter gun control measures, including universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons.

"We cannot afford to wait any longer to take action on gun violence," Whitmer said. "We need to do everything we can to keep our communities safe."

However, not everyone agrees with Whitmer's approach. Meshawn Maddock, co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party, expressed support for armed teachers as a way to deter school shootings.

"We need to give our teachers the tools they need to protect our children," Maddock said. "That means allowing them to carry firearms in schools."

The Oxford High School shooting is considered the sixth mass shooting in 2021, contrasting with two in 2020. The increase in mass shootings has led to renewed calls for stricter gun control, but support for such measures has diminished in recent years.

According to a Gallup poll, only 52% of Americans now favor stricter gun control, down from 64% in 2017. This decline in support suggests that finding a consensus on gun safety will be a challenging task for policymakers.

The surge in Black Friday gun sales and the Oxford High School shooting have highlighted the complex and divisive nature of the gun debate in the United States. As the nation grapples with the aftermath of this tragedy, it remains to be seen whether the calls for stricter gun control will gain traction or if the status quo will prevail.
