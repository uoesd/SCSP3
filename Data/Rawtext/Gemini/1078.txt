Human Remains Found in Wyoming Match Missing Gabby Petito's Description

Jackson, Wyoming - Human remains discovered in Teton County, Wyoming, on Sunday, September 19, 2021, match the description of missing 22-year-old Gabby Petito, the FBI has confirmed.

"Full forensic identification is pending to confirm the identity of the remains," stated Charles Jones, FBI Denver's supervisory senior resident agent. "The cause of death has not been determined."

The remains were located in the Spread Creek Dispersed Camping Area within the Bridger-Teton National Forest, where search efforts had been concentrated in recent days.

Petito was reported missing on September 11 after a cross-country road trip with her fiancé, Brian Laundrie. Laundrie returned to their home in North Port, Florida, on September 1 without Petito.

Laundrie is not currently wanted for a crime, but his sudden disappearance has prompted extensive search efforts. On Monday, September 20, authorities in Florida announced they were searching for Laundrie in the Carlton Reserve, a 25,000-acre wilderness area.

"We are utilizing drones, bloodhounds, and all available resources to locate Mr. Laundrie," said North Port police spokesperson Josh Taylor. "We urge anyone with information about his whereabouts to contact law enforcement."

The Laundrie family attorney, Steven Bertolino, released a statement expressing condolences to the Petito family and stating that the Laundries are "remaining patient and will cooperate with the investigation."

Richard Stafford, the Petito family attorney, thanked law enforcement for their efforts and expressed hope that the discovery of the remains would bring closure to the family.

"The Petito family is grateful for the hard work and dedication of law enforcement in finding Gabby," Stafford said. "We hope that this discovery will help bring closure to this tragic situation."

The search for Laundrie is ongoing, and authorities are asking for the public's assistance in locating him. Anyone with information is urged to contact the FBI or their local law enforcement agency.
