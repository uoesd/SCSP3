Padilla Makes History as First Latino U.S. Senator from California

Former Los Angeles City Councilman Alex Padilla has been appointed by Governor Gavin Newsom to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Padilla, who resigned as California secretary of state to assume his new role, will be the first Latino to represent California in the Senate.

"I am honored and humbled to be appointed to the United States Senate," said Padilla. "I will work tirelessly to represent the people of California and fight for their values."

Harris formally resigned her Senate seat on Monday, ahead of her inauguration with President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday.

Padilla has a long history of public service, having served on the Los Angeles City Council from 1999 to 2006 and in the California state Senate from 2006 to 2015. Before his political career, he earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and worked for Hughes Aircraft.

With the inauguration of Biden and Harris approaching, security has been increased at the U.S. Capitol and state capitals due to threats of violence.

"We are seeing an unprecedented level of threats against our government," said Charles Marino, CEO of Sentinel Security Solutions. "We are taking every precaution to ensure the safety of our elected officials and the public."

Governor Newsom has nominated Shirley Weber, a Democratic state senator, to succeed Padilla as secretary of state. If confirmed by the state Senate, Weber would become the first Black woman to hold that position.

Padilla's deputy, James Schwab, will serve as acting secretary of state until Weber's confirmation.

"I am confident that Alex Padilla will be a strong voice for California in the U.S. Senate," said Newsom. "He has a proven track record of public service and is committed to fighting for the people of our state."
