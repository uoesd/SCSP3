Impeachment Alone Does Not Strip Trump of Benefits or Bar Him from 2024 Run

Washington – A viral tweet has spread misinformation about the consequences of a second impeachment of former President Donald Trump, claiming that it would prevent him from running for office in 2024 and strip him of several benefits. However, legal experts say these claims are inaccurate.

Impeachment and Post-Presidency Benefits

Impeachment, the process of formally accusing a president of wrongdoing, does not automatically lead to the loss of post-presidency benefits. The Former Presidents Act only revokes a president's pension if they are impeached and then removed from office by the Senate.

"Impeachment alone does not affect a president's post-presidency benefits," said Ross Garber, an impeachment and political investigations lawyer and professor at Tulane Law School. "The Former Presidents Act is very clear on this point."

Travel Allowance and Secret Service Protection

The viral tweet also suggests that impeachment would result in the loss of a $1 million travel allowance and lifetime Secret Service protection. However, these claims are also false.

Former presidents are not given a $1 million travel allowance. Instead, they receive a travel budget of up to $1 million per year for official travel expenses. This budget is not affected by impeachment.

As for Secret Service protection, it is uncertain whether a president removed from office would lose it. There are conflicting laws on this issue.

"The law is not entirely clear on whether a president removed from office would lose lifetime Secret Service protection," said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law. "There are arguments to be made on both sides."

Disqualification from Future Office

To disqualify Trump from future office, the Senate would need to have a separate vote after a conviction. This process is not bypassed by impeachment alone.

"Impeachment does not automatically disqualify a president from holding future office," said Josh Blackman, a law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. "The Senate would need to have a separate vote to do that."

Legal Uncertainty

Legal experts are also unsure if the presidency falls under an "Office of honor, Trust or Profit" that one can be disqualified from holding after impeachment and conviction.

"The Supreme Court has never ruled on whether the presidency is an 'Office of honor, Trust or Profit,'" said Garber. "This is a legal question that has yet to be resolved."

Viral Tweet's Inaccuracy

The person who posted the viral tweet, a former Trump campaign official, admitted that the information might be incorrect.

"I'm not sure if the information is accurate," the person said. "I was surprised by how viral the tweet became."

Conclusion

The viral tweet about the consequences of a second impeachment of Donald Trump is inaccurate. Impeachment alone does not affect a president's post-presidency benefits or their ability to run for office again. To disqualify Trump from future office, the Senate would need to have a separate vote after a conviction.
