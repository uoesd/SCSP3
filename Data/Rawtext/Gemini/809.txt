Third Stimulus Checks: Up to $1,400 Per Person, Expanded Eligibility in $1.9 Trillion Covid Relief Package

In a significant step towards economic recovery, the recently passed $1.9 trillion Covid relief package includes a third round of stimulus payments, providing much-needed financial assistance to millions of Americans. These payments, which could reach up to $1,400 per person, including dependents, are designed to bolster household finances and stimulate consumer spending.

Expanded Eligibility for Adult Dependents

A notable change in this round of stimulus payments is the expansion of eligibility to include adult dependents over the age of 17. Previously, only dependents under the age of 17 were eligible for payments. This change recognizes the financial burden that many families with adult dependents have faced during the pandemic.

Income Limits and Phase-Out

To ensure that the stimulus payments are targeted to those who need them most, income limits have been established. Individuals with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $80,000 or less, heads of households with an AGI of $120,000 or less, and married couples filing jointly with an AGI of $160,000 or less are eligible for the full $1,400 payment.

However, the payments phase out faster than in previous rounds. For individuals, the phase-out begins at $75,000 and is completely phased out at $80,000. For heads of households, the phase-out begins at $112,500 and is completely phased out at $120,000. For married couples filing jointly, the phase-out begins at $150,000 and is completely phased out at $160,000.

Eligibility Based on Tax Returns

Eligibility for the stimulus payments will be based on the most recent tax return filed. For those who have not yet filed their 2020 tax returns, the IRS will use their 2019 tax returns to determine eligibility.

Payment Timeline and Distribution

The stimulus payments are expected to start arriving shortly after President Joe Biden signs the bill into law. The IRS has indicated that payments will be made via direct deposit, paper checks, and EIP (Economic Impact Payment) cards.

Undocumented Immigrants Remain Ineligible

It is important to note that undocumented immigrants without Social Security numbers remain ineligible for the stimulus payments. This exclusion has drawn criticism from advocates who argue that undocumented immigrants have also been severely impacted by the pandemic and should be eligible for financial assistance.

Recovery Rebate Credit for Missed Payments

Individuals who did not receive previous stimulus payments and believe they are eligible can claim the amount as a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 tax returns. The IRS has provided guidance on how to claim the credit on the IRS website.

Impact on American Households

The third round of stimulus payments is expected to have a significant impact on American households. According to the IRS, about 90% of American households will be eligible for the payments. The payments are intended to provide immediate financial relief, stimulate consumer spending, and support the economic recovery.

Economic Stimulus and Recovery

The $1.9 trillion Covid relief package, including the third round of stimulus payments, is a comprehensive effort to address the economic fallout of the pandemic. The payments are expected to provide a much-needed boost to household finances, support businesses, and accelerate the economic recovery.

Additional Provisions in the Relief Package

In addition to the stimulus payments, the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package includes a range of other provisions aimed at providing economic relief and supporting the recovery. These provisions include:

  • Extended unemployment benefits
  • Funding for vaccine distribution and testing
  • Aid to state and local governments
  • Support for small businesses
  • Tax breaks for families and individuals

The passage of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package is a significant step towards economic recovery. The stimulus payments, along with the other provisions in the package, are designed to provide immediate financial assistance, support businesses, and accelerate the economic recovery.
