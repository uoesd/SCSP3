Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer to Step Down, Andrew Bosworth to Take Helm

Facebook's Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Mike Schroepfer, has announced his plans to step down in 2022. Schroepfer, who has been with the company since 2013, will be replaced by Andrew Bosworth, the current leader of Facebook's augmented and virtual reality division.

"After 13 years at Meta, I've decided to step down as CTO next year," Schroepfer said in a statement. "It's been an incredible journey, and I'm so grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such an amazing team."

Bosworth, who joined Facebook in 2006, will take over as CTO on March 28, 2022. He is widely regarded as a visionary leader in the field of augmented and virtual reality, and his appointment signals Facebook's strategic push into these emerging technologies.

"I'm excited to take on this new role and help build the future of Facebook," Bosworth said. "I believe that augmented and virtual reality have the potential to change the way we live, work, and connect with each other."

Schroepfer's departure is part of a recent wave of executive departures from Facebook. In recent months, the company has lost its Chief Revenue Officer, David Fischer, and its VR leader, Hugo Barra.

Some observers have expressed concern about the impact of these departures on Facebook's leadership. Samidh Chakrabarti, a former director of product management at Facebook, said that Schroepfer's departure is "a big loss for the company."

"Mike was one of the few people at Facebook who had a deep understanding of both technology and business," Chakrabarti said. "He was also a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion."

Despite these concerns, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has expressed confidence in Bosworth's ability to lead the company into the future.

"Andrew is a brilliant leader with a deep understanding of our technology and our mission," Zuckerberg said. "I'm confident that he will help us build the future of Facebook and make the metaverse a reality."

The metaverse is a concept that Zuckerberg has been talking about for several years. He envisions a digital space where people can interact with each other and with digital objects in a realistic way. Bosworth's work on augmented and virtual reality is seen as foundational to Facebook's efforts to build the metaverse.

"The metaverse is the next chapter of the internet," Bosworth said. "It's a place where we can connect with each other and with the world around us in a more immersive and meaningful way."

Facebook's transition into a "metaverse company" is a major strategic shift for the company. It remains to be seen whether the company can successfully execute on this vision. However, the appointment of Bosworth as CTO is a clear signal that Facebook is serious about its metaverse ambitions.
