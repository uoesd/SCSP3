Over 2.8 Million Demand $2,000 Monthly Stimulus Payments

A Change.org petition calling for $2,000 monthly stimulus payments to Americans has garnered over 2.8 million signatures, inching closer to becoming one of the most signed petitions on the platform.

"We need immediate and recurring payments to help us survive this pandemic," said Stephanie Bonin, the petition's creator. "People are struggling to pay rent, put food on the table, and keep their families safe."

The petition aims to reach 3 million signatures, a milestone that would make it one of the top signed on Change.org. Five additional petitions on the platform are also gaining attention, advocating for monthly stimulus checks.

Despite the growing public support, the current economic outlook makes a fourth stimulus check from the White House or Congress unlikely. The Biden administration and Congress have not passed any direct legislation for such a measure.

Rumors circulating online about a $7,000 fourth stimulus check being distributed this week are false. The U.S. government has issued three rounds of stimulus payments since the start of the pandemic, with varying amounts.

The first stimulus payment, in March 2020, provided up to $1,200 per individual. Subsequent payments were $600 in December 2020 and up to $1,400 in March 2021.

"While the economy is improving, many people are still struggling," said Bonin. "Monthly stimulus payments would provide a much-needed lifeline for those who are still facing financial hardship."

The petition's supporters argue that recurring payments would help stimulate the economy and provide financial stability for families. However, opponents contend that such a measure would be too costly and could lead to inflation.

As the petition continues to gain momentum, it remains to be seen whether it will sway policymakers to consider monthly stimulus payments. In the meantime, the need for financial assistance for those impacted by the pandemic remains pressing.
