Tiger Woods' Recovery: Justin Thomas Shares Insights on Golf Legend's Return

Justin Thomas, a close friend and fellow golfer of Tiger Woods, has provided an update on Woods' recovery from a severe car accident that left him with significant orthopedic injuries to his right leg.

In an interview on the No Laying Up podcast, Thomas revealed that Woods is in good spirits and has been actively involved in his children's activities. "He's doing well," Thomas said. "He's in a good place. He's got his kids back in school, and he's able to be a dad, which is the most important thing to him."

Woods' recovery has been remarkable, considering the extent of his injuries. After surviving the February accident, he underwent multiple surgeries and has been undergoing extensive physical therapy. "He's made an incredible recovery," a source told PEOPLE. "He's been working really hard, and it's showing."

While Woods' return to the PGA Tour remains uncertain, Thomas believes he will only come back if he can play at a high level. "I don't think he's going to come back unless he can play well," Thomas said. "He's not going to come back just to come back."

Woods' priority, according to Thomas, is being a father to his children, Charlie and Sam. "He's just trying to be a dad right now," Thomas said. "That's his main focus."

A source close to Woods confirmed that being a dad has been a driving force in his recovery. "It's helped him stay focused," the source said. "He wants to be there for his kids, and he knows that he needs to be healthy to do that."

Woods has been making steady progress in his physical therapy, and insiders say he feels strong and healthy. "He's optimistic about returning to the tour," an insider said. "He's got a timeframe in his mind, but he's not sharing it with anyone."

The details of Woods' February car accident were recounted in the article, including his injuries and the aftermath. The accident occurred on February 23rd, when Woods' SUV rolled over several times. He suffered multiple fractures to his right leg and ankle, requiring immediate surgery.

Woods' recovery has been a testament to his determination and resilience. He has faced numerous challenges throughout his career, but he has always managed to overcome them. His return to the PGA Tour would be a remarkable comeback story, and it would be a fitting tribute to his legacy as one of the greatest golfers of all time.
