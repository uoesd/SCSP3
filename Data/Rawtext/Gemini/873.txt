Tiger Woods Hospitalized with Severe Leg Injuries After Los Angeles Car Accident

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) – Tiger Woods was hospitalized with severe leg injuries Tuesday after his car crashed in Los Angeles, authorities said.

The 45-year-old golf legend was conscious and able to communicate after the single-vehicle accident, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva.

"He was able to speak to the firefighters and paramedics on scene," Villanueva said. "He was lucid, no evidence of any impairment whatsoever."

Woods was driving an SUV when it rolled over several times on a steep road in the upscale Rancho Palos Verdes neighborhood around 7 a.m. PT, according to authorities.

"The vehicle sustained major damage," said Daryl Osby, the Los Angeles County Fire Chief. "The front end was totally crushed."

Woods was extricated from the wreckage using the "jaws of life" and taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he underwent a "long surgical procedure" on his lower right leg and ankle, according to Anish Mahajan, the hospital's Chief Medical Officer and interim CEO.

"Comminuted open fractures affecting both the upper and lower portions of the tibia and fibula bones were stabilized by inserting a rod into the tibia," Mahajan said. "Additional injuries to the bones of the foot and ankle were stabilized with screws and pins."

Mahajan said Woods suffered "significant orthopedic injuries" but no life-threatening injuries. He is expected to make a full recovery, but the extent of his injuries and the impact on his golf career remain unclear.

"It's very early to speculate about his future," Mahajan said. "We're just happy that he's alive."

Villanueva said the crash site is known for frequent accidents, suggesting speed might have been a factor.

"This is a downhill slope with a slight curve," Villanueva said. "It's not uncommon for people to lose control."

Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, said in a statement that Woods was "awake, responsive, and recovering in his hospital room."

"Tiger wants to thank the wonderful people who helped him so expertly at the scene and hospital," Steinberg said. "On behalf of Tiger and his family, we want to express our sincere gratitude to everyone for the overwhelming support and messages we have received."

Jay Monahan, the Commissioner of the PGA Tour, said in a statement that the tour was "deeply concerned" about Woods' well-being.

"Tiger is an icon in our sport and his presence has had a profound impact on the game of golf," Monahan said. "We send our thoughts, prayers, and support to Tiger and his family during this difficult time."

Woods is widely considered one of the greatest golfers of all time. He has won 15 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus' 18. He has also won 82 PGA Tour events, tied for the most all-time.

Woods' dominance on the golf course has helped transform the game, broadening its appeal and inspiring a new generation of players.

"Tiger has meant so much to the game of golf," said Alex Rodriguez, the former MLB star. "He's a true champion and an inspiration to us all."

This is not Woods' first encounter with an auto-related incident. In 2009, he crashed his SUV into a fire hydrant and a tree near his home in Florida. He was cited for careless driving and later pleaded guilty to reckless driving.

Woods has also had a history of back injuries, which have required multiple surgeries. In 2017, he underwent spinal fusion surgery, which kept him out of competition for over a year.

Despite his injuries, Woods has remained one of the most popular and recognizable athletes in the world. He is a global ambassador for several major brands and has his own line of golf equipment and apparel.

Woods' accident has sent shockwaves through the sports world and beyond. His fans and supporters are hoping for a speedy recovery and a return to the golf course.
