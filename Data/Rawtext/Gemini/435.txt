Harry and Meghan Sever Ties with Royal Family, Relinquish Titles

LONDON (AP) – Buckingham Palace announced Friday that Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will not return to royal duties, finalizing their separation from the family.

The decision comes after a year-long review of their roles, which began when the couple stepped away from senior royal duties in March 2020.

"Following conversations with The Duke, The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service," the palace said in a statement.

Harry will relinquish his honorary military titles, including Captain General of the Royal Marines, Honorary Air Commandant of RAF Honington, and Commodore-in-Chief, Small Ships and Diving, Royal Naval Command.

Meghan will lose her patronages, including with Britain's National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.

The couple will retain their Duke and Duchess titles but will no longer use "royal highness" or receive public funds for royal duties.

"This confirmation is a testament to the fact that having stepped back from royal duties, it is not possible to pick and choose which elements of the job one will continue to perform," said Angela Levin, a biographer of Prince Harry.

The decision was made after discussions between Queen Elizabeth II and Harry, who agreed that it was impossible for him to continue with public service responsibilities while living outside the United Kingdom.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have expressed their desire to live a life of service," the palace said. "They remain committed to their duty and service to the United Kingdom and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organizations they have represented regardless of official role."

The couple moved to North America in March 2020, citing media intrusions and racist attitudes in the British press.

In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021, Meghan revealed that she had suicidal thoughts while pregnant with her son, Archie, and that a senior royal had expressed concerns about the color of his skin.

The couple's departure from royal duties has been a source of controversy, with some commentators criticizing them for abandoning their responsibilities. However, others have expressed support for their decision to prioritize their own well-being and happiness.

Despite their decision to step back from royal duties, Harry and Meghan remain much-loved members of the family.

"The Queen, The Prince of Wales, and The Duchess of Cornwall remain committed to supporting them," the palace said.
