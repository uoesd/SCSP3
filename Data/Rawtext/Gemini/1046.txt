Deadly East Austin Fire Amid Winter Storm Raises Safety Concerns

A tragic fire in East Austin has claimed the lives of two individuals and injured others, potentially marking the first fatalities in the Austin area attributed to the ongoing winter storm. The incident underscores the urgent need for caution amid warnings against unsafe heating methods during power outages.

"This is a heartbreaking loss for our community," said Stephen Truesdell, Division Chief of the Austin Fire Department. "Our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the victims."

The fire broke out in a home on East 12th Street early Tuesday morning. Austin firefighters were alerted to the blaze by a passerby and arrived to find five people still inside the residence. Two individuals were pronounced dead at the scene, while the remaining three were transported to a local hospital with injuries.

The house, which sustained extensive damage, was without power at the time of the fire. Investigators believe an indoor warming fire may have ignited the blaze.

"We urge residents to avoid using unsafe heating methods, such as charcoal barbecues or gas grills indoors," Truesdell emphasized. "These methods pose a significant risk of fires and carbon monoxide poisoning."

The winter storm has brought unprecedented challenges to the Austin area, leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without power and facing frigid temperatures. Emergency services have responded to numerous calls related to the severe weather, including hypothermia and carbon monoxide exposure.

"We have seen a significant increase in emergency calls since the onset of the winter weather," said Darren Noak, Captain of Austin-Travis County EMS. "Our crews are working tirelessly to respond to every call, but we need the public's help in staying safe."

Rumors of deaths directly attributed to the cold weather have circulated, but EMS and fire officials have clarified that the determination of cause of death falls to medical examiners.

"It's important to remember that the cold weather itself can be deadly," Noak said. "We urge residents to take precautions to stay warm and avoid exposure to the elements."

Nationwide, the extreme weather has claimed the lives of more than two dozen people, including incidents involving carbon monoxide poisoning and hypothermia.

In Austin, nearly 183,000 Austin Energy customers remained without power as of Tuesday morning. Local leaders have opened additional cold weather shelters to provide refuge for vulnerable residents.

"We are working around the clock to restore power to our customers," said Austin Energy General Manager Jackie Sargent. "In the meantime, we encourage residents to stay informed and take necessary precautions to stay safe."

The Austin Fire Department and Austin-Travis County EMS continue to respond to emergency calls related to the winter storm. Residents are urged to report any unsafe heating practices or other hazards to the appropriate authorities.

Safety Tips for Staying Warm During Power Outages:

  • Use only approved heating devices, such as space heaters or fireplaces.
  • Never use charcoal barbecues or gas grills indoors.
  • Keep heating devices away from flammable materials.
  • Ventilate your home to prevent carbon monoxide buildup.
  • Check on elderly or vulnerable neighbors to ensure their safety.
  • If you lose power, seek shelter in a warm place, such as a community center or cold weather shelter.
