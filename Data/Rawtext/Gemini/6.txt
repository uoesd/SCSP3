Trump Breaks Tradition, Snubs Biden's Inauguration

WASHINGTON (AP) – President Donald Trump has announced that he will not attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, breaking a long-standing tradition of peaceful transition and signaling an act of defiance.

Biden responded to Trump's decision by calling him an "embarrassment" and saying it's a "good thing" he won't be there.

Historically, outgoing and incoming presidents attend the inauguration together, symbolizing a smooth transition of power. Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, except for the ailing Jimmy Carter, have all confirmed their attendance at Biden's inauguration.

Trump's announcement came amidst discussions of his second impeachment and after he was banned from Twitter. He has continued to falsely claim that he won the election and has alleged widespread voter fraud, despite multiple recounts and court rulings affirming Biden's victory.

Vice President Mike Pence's attendance is still uncertain, though Biden has welcomed him. A spokesperson for Pence, Devin O'Malley, said that the vice president "will make a decision about his attendance in the coming days."

Historian Douglas Brinkley said Trump's absence portrays him as a "sore loser" and undermines democracy. "This is a president who is not willing to accept the results of an election that he lost fair and square," Brinkley said. "It's a very dangerous precedent."

Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) defended Trump's decision, saying that he "doesn't want to legitimize a fraudulent election." However, many Republicans have criticized Trump's actions, including former President George W. Bush, who said that "the peaceful transition of power is a hallmark of our democracy."

White House spokesperson Judd Deere said that Trump "has every right to contest the election results and to exhaust all legal and constitutional options." However, he added that the president "respects the sanctity of the American electoral process and will ensure a smooth transition of power."

Discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment or impeachment are ongoing amidst concerns about Trump's actions in his final days. The 25th Amendment allows for the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to remove the president from office if they deem him unfit. Impeachment would require a majority vote in the House of Representatives and a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate.

Trump's decision to snub Biden's inauguration is a significant break from tradition and raises concerns about the future of American democracy. It remains to be seen how Trump's actions will impact the transition of power and the country's political landscape.
