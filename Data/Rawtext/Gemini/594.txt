Vice President Harris Addresses Commission on the Status of Women, Underscoring Democracy's Dependence on Gender Equality

Distinguished members of the Commission on the Status of Women, esteemed guests,

Today, as we gather to commemorate the 75th anniversary of this esteemed commission, I stand before you humbled by the profound legacy you have forged in advancing the rights and opportunities of women around the world. Since its inception in 1947, the commission has served as a beacon of hope, a catalyst for progress, and an unwavering advocate for gender equality.

As we reflect on the commission's remarkable journey, we are reminded of the indissoluble bond between democracy and gender equality. Democracy, in its truest form, is a system of government that ensures every citizen has an equal voice, an equal opportunity to participate in shaping their future, and an equal stake in the fruits of their society. Gender equality is not merely a desirable goal; it is a fundamental pillar upon which a just and equitable democracy must rest.

However, as we gather here today, we are confronted with a sobering reality. The past 15 years have witnessed a troubling decline in global freedom, with the past year marking the worst for global democracy and freedom in over a decade. This erosion of democratic values poses a grave threat to the progress we have made in advancing gender equality.

In the face of these challenges, it is more imperative than ever that we stand united in defense of democracy. Democracy is not a static concept; it is a living, breathing entity that requires our constant vigilance and unwavering commitment. We must work tirelessly to strengthen democratic institutions, promote the rule of law, and ensure that every citizen has the opportunity to participate fully in their society.

The United States is committed to playing a leading role in this global effort. We are strengthening our engagement with the United Nations and have rejoined the Human Rights Council. We believe that by working together with our international partners, we can create a more just and equitable world for all.

The status of democracy is fundamentally linked to the empowerment of women. When women are empowered, they are more likely to participate in the political process, to hold leadership positions, and to contribute to their communities. Their participation strengthens democracy and makes it more responsive to the needs of all citizens.

In the United States, we have made significant progress in advancing the status of women. We have seen a historic increase in the number of women running for and winning elected office. We have more women serving in Congress than ever before. And we have seen women break barriers in leadership roles across all sectors of society.

However, we know that there is still much work to be done. COVID-19 has posed significant threats to women's economic security, physical security, and health worldwide. Women have been disproportionately affected by job losses, increased caregiving responsibilities, and heightened risks of violence.

The United States is committed to addressing these challenges. We have re-engaged with the World Health Organization and are revitalizing our partnerships with other countries to empower women and girls globally. We are also working to ensure that women have equal access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.

As we look to the future, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to upholding democratic values and improving the status of women. We must work together to create a world where every woman has the opportunity to reach her full potential and to live a life of dignity and equality.

In the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, "Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home – so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yet they are the world of the individual person; the neighborhood he lives in; the school or college he attends; the factory, farm, or office where he works. Such are the places where every man, woman, and child seeks equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without discrimination. Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere. Without concerted citizen action to uphold them close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world."

Let us all recommit ourselves to the principles of democracy and gender equality. Let us work together to create a world where every woman and girl has the opportunity to live a life of dignity, equality, and freedom.
