WHO Designates New COVID-19 Variant as Variant of Concern, Omicron

Geneva, 26 November 2021 - The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced that the Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) has designated the B.1.1.529 variant of SARS-CoV-2, first reported to WHO from South Africa on 24 November 2021, as a Variant of Concern (VOC) and assigned it the Greek letter Omicron.

Background

The B.1.1.529 variant was first identified in South Africa and has since been detected in several other countries. The variant has a large number of mutations, including some that are concerning because they may affect the behavior of the virus.

Assessment by TAG-VE

TAG-VE convened on 26 November 2021 to assess the B.1.1.529 variant. The group reviewed the available evidence, including data on the variant's transmissibility, severity, and immune escape potential.

Designation as a Variant of Concern

Based on the evidence, TAG-VE advised that the B.1.1.529 variant should be designated as a VOC. This designation is based on the variant's increased transmissibility, potential for immune escape, and the risk of severe disease.

WHO's Response

WHO has communicated the designation of Omicron as a VOC to all member states and will continue to update them on new findings. WHO is also working with partners to enhance surveillance, sequencing, and reporting of cases associated with VOC infection.

Public Health Measures

Individuals are reminded to continue adhering to public health measures, including:

  • Wearing a mask
  • Maintaining physical distance
  • Washing hands frequently
  • Getting vaccinated

Definitions

  • Variant of Interest (VOI): A variant with genetic changes that are predicted or known to affect virus characteristics such as transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, or diagnostic or therapeutic escape.
  • Variant of Concern (VOC): A variant that has been associated with an increase in transmissibility, severity, or immune escape.

Additional Information

WHO will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide updates as new information becomes available. For more information, please visit the WHO website: www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019
