Suez Canal Backlog Cleared, but Disruptions to Linger for Months

After a week-long ordeal, the Suez Canal has finally been cleared of the backlog of ships stranded due to the grounding of the Ever Given container vessel.

As of Friday, 61 ships remained in the canal, waiting to transit, but the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) expects them to clear by Saturday, ending the massive traffic jam.

"We expect 85 ships to pass through the canal on Saturday," said SCA Chairman Osama Rabie. "The backlog has been cleared ahead of schedule."

The reopening of the canal is a major relief for global trade, but the ripple effects of the blockage are expected to linger for months.

"The disruptions caused by the Ever Given will take months to resolve," said Maersk, the world's largest shipping company. "The backlog of ships will need to be cleared, and the global supply chain will need to adjust to the new reality."

The Ever Given was stuck in the canal for about 152 hours, causing an estimated $60 billion in total costs. The blockage disrupted global trade, with hundreds of ships stranded and cargo deliveries delayed.

The SCA is currently investigating the causes of the blockage, and Rabie said the results will be announced next week.

"The investigation is going well and will take two more days," said Rabie. "Then we will announce the results."

The reopening of the Suez Canal is a positive step, but it does not mark an immediate end to the disruptions caused by the Ever Given. The global supply chain will take time to recover, and the full impact of the blockage may not be known for months.
