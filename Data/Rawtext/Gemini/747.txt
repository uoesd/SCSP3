Assistant Director Ordered to Testify in Halyna Hutchins' Death

SANTA FE, N.M. – A New Mexico judge has ordered assistant director Dave Halls to be interviewed by state workplace safety regulators regarding the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the film "Rust."

Halls handed Alec Baldwin the prop gun that resulted in Hutchins' death on October 21 at the Bonanza Creek Ranch film set near Santa Fe. The Occupational Health and Safety Bureau of the state Environment Department issued the subpoena after Halls declined two previous requests for an interview, citing the ongoing criminal investigation.

"We need to understand what happened and why," said Rebecca Roose, deputy cabinet secretary of the Environment Department. "Mr. Halls' testimony is crucial to our investigation."

District Judge Bryan Biedscheid granted the subpoena request on Friday. Halls' attorney, Lisa Torracco, did not respond to requests for comment but reported to cooperate with the investigation.

"We will comply with the subpoena and continue to cooperate with the investigation," Torracco said.

Roose emphasized the importance of Halls' testimony in determining the cause of the accident. "We need to know what happened before, during, and after the incident," she said. "Mr. Halls' testimony will help us piece together the events that led to this tragedy."

Baldwin has claimed he was unaware the gun contained a live round, emphasizing the need to identify who loaded the weapon. "We need to know who put that live round in that gun," Baldwin said. "We need to know why it was there."

The investigation into Hutchins' death is ongoing. The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office is conducting a criminal investigation, while the Occupational Health and Safety Bureau is investigating workplace safety violations. The results of both investigations are expected to be released in the coming months.
