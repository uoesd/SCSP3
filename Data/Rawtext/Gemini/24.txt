Facebook Tightens Security Measures Ahead of Biden's Inauguration

In response to heightened security concerns surrounding President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, Facebook has implemented a series of measures to prevent potential violence or disruptions.

The social media giant has banned the creation of new events near the White House, U.S. Capitol, and state capitols until after the inauguration on January 20th. Additionally, Facebook will review and remove any inauguration-related events that violate its policies, including those that promote violence or spread misinformation.

To further enhance security, Facebook is blocking U.S.-based events created by accounts outside of the United States. The company is also closely monitoring for signs of violence or threats in Washington, D.C., and across all states.

These measures come amidst warnings from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that domestic extremists pose a significant threat to the inauguration. DHS has issued warnings about potential violence against federal buildings, law enforcement, and public officials.

Facebook's actions follow similar steps taken by other social media platforms in the wake of the Capitol attack on January 6th. Twitter has suspended thousands of accounts associated with QAnon and other extremist groups, while Amazon has removed products that promote violence or conspiracy theories.

Airbnb has also taken precautions by canceling all Washington D.C. reservations for inauguration week due to security concerns. The company stated that it is working with law enforcement to prevent any potential threats.

These measures underscore the heightened security concerns surrounding the upcoming inauguration. Social media platforms and other companies are taking proactive steps to prevent the spread of misinformation and potential violence, while law enforcement agencies are working to ensure a peaceful transition of power.
