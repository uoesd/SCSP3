Millions of Seniors Receive Third Stimulus Checks

Millions of seniors who did not file a 2019 or 2020 tax return have begun receiving their third stimulus checks. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began processing payments for about 30 million seniors after receiving data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) in late March.

Payments are generally being made in the same way recipients receive their regular Social Security benefits, mostly electronically. Seniors receiving Social Security retirement benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefits who did not file a 2019 or 2020 return are included.

Veterans receiving benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs and who did not file a recent tax return will also get payments soon.

Most beneficiaries do not need to take any action to receive their stimulus payment. However, some beneficiaries may need to file a 2020 tax return to claim additional funds for a spouse or dependents.

Every eligible American is set to receive a $1,400 base amount, with $2,800 for married couples and an extra $1,400 for each dependent. Third stimulus checks will be phased out for individuals with higher adjusted gross incomes.

The IRS reminds taxpayers that the deadline for filing a 2020 tax return has been extended to May 17, 2021. Filing a tax return is the best way to ensure you receive the full amount of your stimulus payment.

Conclusion

The third round of stimulus payments is providing much-needed financial relief to millions of Americans, including seniors. If you are a senior who did not file a 2019 or 2020 tax return, you should have received your payment by now. If you have not received your payment, you can check the status on the IRS website or call the IRS at 1-800-919-9835.
