McIlroy: Woods' Well-Being Paramount, Golf Secondary

BRADENTON, Fla. – Rory McIlroy emphasized that after Tiger Woods' severe car crash, golf should not be the current focus.

"The most important thing is that he's okay," McIlroy said. "Golf is secondary."

Woods was involved in a serious car accident on Tuesday, resulting in multiple injuries and surgeries. McIlroy criticized the idea of paying tribute to Woods during the tournament, stating he should be honored every day instead.

"I think we should honor him every day, not just this week," McIlroy said. "He's done so much for the game of golf, and he's meant so much to so many people."

He acknowledged that Woods' presence on the PGA Tour has been monumental and his absence will be noticeable.

"He's the greatest player of all time," McIlroy said. "He's been the face of the game for so long. It's going to be strange not seeing him out there."

Despite the possibility of not seeing Woods play again, McIlroy believes Woods will continue to impact the game in other ways.

"He's still going to be involved in the game," McIlroy said. "He's still going to be a mentor to young players. He's still going to be a force in the game."

McIlroy, a four-time major champion, has not won a tournament since the fall of 2019. After missing his last five cuts, McIlroy is focused on improving his game by playing with more freedom.

"I've been overpreparing technically and underpreparing practically," McIlroy said. "I'm going to try to play with more freedom this week."

He shared his experiences with overpreparing technically but underpreparing practically for the Genesis Invitational.

"I spent too much time on the range and not enough time on the course," McIlroy said. "I need to get back to playing the game."

McIlroy is looking to learn from his mistakes, focusing less on the technicalities and more on playing the game.

"I'm going to try to play with more freedom this week," McIlroy said. "I'm going to try to hit the ball and see where it goes."

McIlroy is confident that he can return to his winning ways.

"I know I can play better," McIlroy said. "I just need to get out of my own way."

McIlroy is scheduled to tee off at 1:05 p.m. ET on Thursday in the first round of the WGC-Workday Championship.
