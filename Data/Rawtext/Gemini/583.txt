America's Longest War Ends: Last U.S. Troops Depart Afghanistan

Aug 30 (Reuters) – The last U.S. troops left Afghanistan on Monday, ending America's longest war, two decades after the September 11 attacks that prompted the invasion.

"I'm here to announce the completion of our withdrawal from Afghanistan and the end of the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan," U.S. General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said at a Pentagon news conference.

The withdrawal marks a significant milestone in U.S. history, as the war in Afghanistan has been the longest and most expensive in American history. It has also been one of the deadliest, with over 2,400 U.S. service members killed and over 20,000 wounded.

The war began on October 7, 2001, when the United States launched airstrikes against the Taliban and al Qaeda in response to the September 11 attacks. The initial focus of the war was on capturing or killing Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and dismantling the terrorist group's network in Afghanistan.

In December 2001, U.S. forces launched a major offensive in Tora Bora, Afghanistan, where bin Laden was believed to be hiding. However, bin Laden escaped to Pakistan, and the U.S. focus shifted to stabilizing Afghanistan and preventing the Taliban from regaining power.

In May 2003, the United States declared major combat operations over in Afghanistan and began to draw down its forces. However, the Taliban quickly began to regroup, and by 2006, they were launching regular attacks against U.S. and Afghan forces.

In February 2009, President Obama increased the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to over 100,000 in an attempt to quell the Taliban insurgency. However, the Taliban continued to gain ground, and by 2011, they controlled large swaths of the country.

In May 2011, U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden in a raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The killing of bin Laden was a major blow to al Qaeda, but the Taliban continued to pose a significant threat to Afghanistan.

In May 2014, President Obama announced that the United States would begin to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and focus on training the Afghan military. The withdrawal was completed by the end of 2016, but the Taliban quickly regained control of much of the country.

In February 2020, the Trump administration signed an agreement with the Taliban that called for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by May 2021. The agreement also called for the Taliban to negotiate a peace settlement with the Afghan government.

However, the peace talks stalled, and the Taliban continued to launch attacks against Afghan forces. In August 2021, the Taliban launched a major offensive that quickly overran the Afghan government and seized control of the country.

The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan has been chaotic and deadly. On August 26, 2021, an ISIS suicide bomb attack at the Kabul airport killed scores of people, including 13 U.S. troops. The attack highlighted the challenges of evacuating U.S. citizens and Afghan allies from the country.

The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan marks the end of an era. The war has been a costly and bloody affair, and it has left a lasting legacy of pain and suffering. The future of Afghanistan is uncertain, but the United States will continue to play a role in the country, providing humanitarian assistance and supporting the Afghan people.
