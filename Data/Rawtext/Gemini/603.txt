Vice President Harris Indulges in Sweet Treat at Brown Sugar Bakery

Chicago, IL - Vice President Kamala Harris made a delectable stop at Brown Sugar Bakery on her recent journey from California to Washington, D.C. The Vice President's sweet tooth led her to indulge in a slice of her beloved German chocolate cake, a testament to the bakery's renowned southern-style desserts.

Brown Sugar Bakery, founded in 2004 by Stephanie Hart, has garnered widespread acclaim for its delectable offerings. The bakery's caramel cake, in particular, has achieved legendary status, with Hart crediting an elderly lady in Arkansas for the treasured recipe.

"I learned the caramel cake recipe from an elderly lady in Arkansas. She was a dear friend of mine, and she taught me how to make it," Hart said. "It's a very special recipe, and I'm so grateful that she shared it with me."

Hart's entrepreneurial spirit propelled her to expand Brown Sugar Bakery's reach by acquiring the Cupid Candies factory with the aid of a $500,000 state grant. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, including temporary closures, the bakery has persevered with unwavering community support.

"The community has been so supportive of us, especially during the pandemic," Hart said. "We had to close for a while, but our customers were so patient and understanding. They kept ordering cakes and cupcakes online, and they even donated money to help us stay afloat."

The bakery's resilience was further bolstered by a generous $10,000 grant from the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which was featured on 'Good Morning America'. The grant provided a much-needed lifeline during a difficult time.

"The grant from LISC was a godsend," Hart said. "It helped us pay our rent and keep our employees on the payroll. We're so grateful for their support."

Brown Sugar Bakery's loyal customers have demonstrated their unwavering dedication by enduring long lines outside the bakery, even in inclement weather. The bakery's popularity has extended beyond Chicago, with nationwide shipping fulfilling orders across the country.

"Our customers are the best," Hart said. "They're so passionate about our cakes and cupcakes. They'll wait in line for hours, even in the cold, just to get their hands on our treats."

Vice President Harris's visit to Brown Sugar Bakery was hailed as a "sweet call" by local residents. Her choice of the bakery for dessert underscores the establishment's reputation as a culinary gem in Chicago.

"We were so honored to have the Vice President visit our bakery," Hart said. "It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team. We're so grateful for her support."

Brown Sugar Bakery's success story serves as an inspiration to aspiring entrepreneurs and a testament to the power of community support. The bakery's delectable treats have not only satisfied countless sweet cravings but have also fostered a sense of unity and resilience within the Chicago community.
