Biden Inauguration Security Heightened Amid Ongoing Threats

Washington, DC – In the wake of the deadly Capitol Hill riot, Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has requested increased security measures for President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.

"The events of January 6th have shown that we need a different approach to security," Bowser wrote in a letter to the US Department of Homeland Security. "We must take into account the heightened threat of violence and the need for a comprehensive security plan."

The January 6th violence left five people dead, including a police officer, after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election.

Bowser's letter outlines several specific requests, including daily intelligence and threat briefings from the FBI, the cancellation of all public gathering permits during January 11-24, and the coordination of federal force deployment among the Homeland Security, Defense, Justice departments, Congress, and the Supreme Court.

"We need to ensure that the inauguration is safe and secure for all participants," Bowser said. "We cannot afford to have a repeat of the violence that we saw on January 6th."

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer echoed Bowser's concerns, emphasizing the ongoing high threat from violent extremist groups as Biden's inauguration approaches.

"The threat of violence is real and it is ongoing," Schumer said. "We must take every possible step to protect the inauguration and ensure a peaceful transition of power."

The US Department of Justice has charged two more alleged rioters in connection with the Capitol Hill violence, bringing the total number of arrests to over 100. Investigations into the riot are ongoing, with police and fire departments in various states investigating members who may have participated.

US Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy informed US Representative Jason Crow that 25 domestic terrorism cases have been opened in relation to the riot.

"The FBI is working around the clock to identify and apprehend those responsible for the violence on January 6th," Crow said. "We will not tolerate domestic terrorism in our country."

President Trump has announced that he will not attend Biden's inauguration, which will be a scaled-down event due to COVID-19, similar to the Democratic National Convention.
