Tiger Woods Seriously Injured in Los Angeles Car Crash

LOS ANGELES (AP) – Tiger Woods was seriously injured in a single-car accident in suburban Los Angeles early Tuesday morning, according to his manager, Mark Steinberg.

The crash occurred around 7:12 a.m. PST in the Rolling Hills Estates area, when Woods' SUV struck a curb, a tree, and then rolled over, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

Woods, who was the sole occupant of the vehicle, had to be extricated from the wreckage by firefighters using the "jaws of life" tool. He was then transported to a local hospital, where he underwent surgery for multiple leg injuries.

"Tiger Woods was in a single-car accident this morning in California," Steinberg said in a statement. "He has been taken to the hospital and is undergoing surgery for multiple leg injuries."

Christopher Thomas, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department, said Woods was "conscious and breathing" when he was removed from the vehicle.

"The vehicle sustained major damage," Thomas said. "It rolled over several times and came to a rest on its side."

The cause of the accident is still under investigation, but authorities said there was no evidence of impairment.

A second minor crash occurred near the scene when a vehicle that had stopped to help was struck by another car. No one was injured in that crash.

Woods was in Los Angeles for the Genesis Invitational, a PGA Tour event he hosts at Riviera Country Club. He was also scheduled to participate in a TV shoot with GOLFTV on Tuesday.

The accident is the latest in a series of physical setbacks for Woods, who has undergone numerous surgeries on his back and knee in recent years.

This is also the third time Woods has been involved in a car investigation. In 2009, he crashed his SUV into a fire hydrant and a tree outside his Florida home. In 2017, he was arrested for driving under the influence after police found him asleep at the wheel of his car.

Woods' accident has sent shockwaves through the sports world, with athletes and celebrities expressing concern and hopes for his quick recovery.

"Praying for my friend @TigerWoods as we all anxiously await more news," tweeted former President Barack Obama.

"Thoughts and prayers to @TigerWoods and his family," tweeted basketball star LeBron James. "Hoping for a full and speedy recovery."

Woods is one of the most successful golfers in history, with 15 major championships and 82 PGA Tour victories. He is also one of the most recognizable athletes in the world.

The accident is a major setback for Woods, both personally and professionally. It is unclear how long he will be out of action, but it is likely to impact his plans for the upcoming golf season.
