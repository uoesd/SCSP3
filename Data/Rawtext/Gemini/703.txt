Student Arrested for Plotting School Shooting at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University

Daytona Beach, FL - In a chilling turn of events, Florida police have arrested a 19-year-old student, John Hagins, for allegedly planning a school shooting at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The arrest was made after two students reported his concerning Snapchat messages to authorities, potentially thwarting a mass tragedy.

"This is a very serious matter, and we are grateful to the students who came forward with this information," said Daytona Beach Police Chief Jakari Young. "Their actions may have saved countless lives."

Hagins faces charges of terrorism, written threats to injure or kill, and attempted first-degree homicide. He is being held without bond at Volusia County Jail.

According to the police report, Hagins' Snapchat messages referenced the 1999 Columbine High School shooting and expressed his intent to carry out a similar attack. He had sold his car to purchase a folding rifle and ammunition, and posted about being "finished with his school shopping" on Snapchat.

Hagins planned to go to a shooting range for practice and targeted the last day of the semester for maximum impact. Police found a backpack with ammunition and the rifle in Hagins' apartment on campus upon arrest.

"We are deeply concerned about this incident and are taking it very seriously," said Barry Butler, President of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. "We commend the students and police for their swift action and are committed to providing a safe and secure environment for our students."

Chief Young emphasized the importance of reporting such threats to prevent violence. "If you see something, say something," he urged. "We need the community's help to keep our schools and neighborhoods safe."

The students who reported Hagins' messages are being hailed as heroes for their courage and quick thinking. Their actions may have prevented a horrific tragedy and saved countless lives.

Hagins' arrest serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vigilance and reporting suspicious behavior. By working together, communities can prevent violence and ensure the safety of their schools and neighborhoods.
