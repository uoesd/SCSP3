Trump's Indecent Attack on Colin Powell

Former President Donald Trump's response to the death of Colin Powell, the distinguished former Secretary of State, was a masterclass in indecency. While world leaders and even Trump's fellow Republicans praised Powell's legacy, Trump chose to focus on petty grievances and insults.

Powell, who died of COVID-19 on October 18, was a decorated military officer, a four-star general, and the first African American to serve as Secretary of State. He was also a vocal critic of Trump, calling him "a national disgrace" and "a danger to our democracy."

In his statement on Powell's death, Trump could not resist taking a swipe at his former critic, calling him a "RINO" (Republican in name only) and highlighting his mistakes. This tasteless and disrespectful behavior was a stark contrast to the praise Powell received from other leaders.

President Biden called Powell "a great American" and "a man of honor and dignity." Former President George W. Bush said Powell was "a great public servant" and "a man of integrity and honor." Even former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a Trump loyalist, praised Powell as "a great American."

Trump's history of attacking Republican leaders is well-documented. He has belittled war heroes like John McCain and attacked former President George H.W. Bush. His attacks on Powell are simply the latest example of his inability to tolerate dissent or criticism.

Powell was an intellectual, a patriot, and a human being far superior to Trump. He served his country with distinction and honor, while Trump has spent his life dodging the draft, failing at business, and grifting his supporters.

Powell regretted his role in the Iraq invasion, which he later called a "mistake." Trump, on the other hand, refuses to take responsibility for any failures, including his administration's disastrous COVID-19 response.

Powell served the nation with grace and dignity, even when he disagreed with its leaders. Trump, on the other hand, is a petty, vindictive, and self-serving individual who has no respect for the office he once held or the people he claims to represent.

Trump's continuous falsehoods about a "rigged" election and his attacks on the media are further evidence of his unfitness for office. He is a dangerous demagogue who has no regard for truth or decency.

Colin Powell was a true American hero. Donald Trump is nothing but a cheap imitation.
