Google, Facebook Threaten to Limit Services in Australia Over News Payment Code

Sydney, Australia - Google and Facebook have threatened to limit their services in Australia if the government proceeds with a digital news code that would require the tech giants to pay news media for content.

The code, proposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), is designed to support the struggling news media industry by requiring digital platforms to negotiate payments for content that appears on their platforms.

Google's Australian managing director, Mel Silva, described the code as "untenable" and a potential "dangerous precedent."

"We are deeply concerned about the impact of this code on our business and the Australian digital economy," Silva said. "We believe it is a dangerous precedent that could lead to other countries adopting similar measures."

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison insisted that Australia makes its own rules and will not respond to threats.

"Australia makes our own rules for things that happen in Australia," Morrison said. "We don't respond to threats."

Reset Australia, a non-profit organization that advocates for responsible technology use, criticized Google for behaving like a "bully" towards the nation.

"Google is behaving like a bully towards Australia," said Chris Cooper, executive director of Reset Australia. "They are threatening to take away their services if they don't get what they want."

Facebook's head of public policy in Australia, Josh Machin, claimed that limiting news content would not significantly affect the platform since news makes up less than 5% of what users see.

"News is a very small part of what people see on Facebook," Machin said. "If we were to limit news content, it would not have a significant impact on our platform."

The ACCC chair, Rod Sims, emphasized that the code promotes fairness in negotiations between digital platforms and news media.

"The code is designed to ensure that news media businesses are fairly compensated for the content they create," Sims said. "It is not about giving news media businesses a handout."

Labor's shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, expressed concern over the code's potential impact on the digital economy.

"We need to be very careful about the unintended consequences of this code," Rowland said. "We don't want to end up harming the digital economy in Australia."

A poll conducted by the University of Canberra found that a majority of Australians support prioritizing journalism in social media feeds and transparency about algorithm influences.

The poll found that 72% of Australians believe that social media platforms should prioritize journalism in their feeds, while 69% believe that platforms should be more transparent about how their algorithms work.

Impact on Australian Users

The potential withdrawal of Google and Facebook services would have a significant impact on Australian users.

Google is the most popular search engine in Australia, with 19 million users. Facebook is the most popular social media platform in Australia, with 17 million users.

If Google and Facebook were to limit their services in Australia, it would make it more difficult for Australians to access information and connect with others online.

Industry Reaction

The Australian news media industry has welcomed the proposed digital news code.

"The code is a vital step towards ensuring that news media businesses are fairly compensated for the content they create," said Dan Stinton, managing director of Guardian Australia. "It is essential for the future of journalism in Australia."

The tech industry has expressed concern about the code.

"The code is a blunt instrument that will harm the digital economy in Australia," said a spokesperson for the Australian Information Industry Association. "It will stifle innovation and make it more difficult for Australian businesses to compete globally."

Government Response

The Australian government has said that it is committed to implementing the digital news code.

"The code is a fair and reasonable way to ensure that news media businesses are fairly compensated for the content they create," said Communications Minister Paul Fletcher. "We are confident that the code will be implemented in a way that supports the digital economy in Australia."

Next Steps

The digital news code is currently being considered by the Australian parliament. The parliament is expected to vote on the code in the coming weeks.

If the code is passed, Google and Facebook will have to decide whether to limit their services in Australia.
