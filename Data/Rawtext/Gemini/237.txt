Biden Not to Blame for Gas, Lumber Price Hikes, Fact Check Shows

WASHINGTON (AP) – House Republican leaders are falsely blaming President Joe Biden for the recent rise in gasoline and lumber costs, according to a fact check by The Associated Press.

The recent increase in gas prices is primarily attributed to the cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, which disrupted fuel supplies along the East Coast. The pipeline has since resumed operations, but some states are still experiencing gas shortages.

"The recent spike in gas prices is a direct result of President Biden's policies," House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a statement. "His war on American energy has led to higher costs for families and businesses."

However, experts say that Biden's policies are not responsible for the gas price increases.

"The rise in gas prices is due to a number of factors, including the Colonial Pipeline shutdown and the global economic recovery," said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy. "Biden's policies have not had a significant impact on gas prices."

Republicans have also claimed that Biden's cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline is responsible for the current gasoline prices. However, this claim is misleading. The Keystone XL pipeline carries crude oil, not gasoline.

"The Keystone XL pipeline would not have any impact on gasoline prices," DeHaan said. "Gasoline is made from crude oil that is already being produced in the United States."

Gas prices are higher because of a rapid bounce-back in demand and lingering problems from the Colonial Pipeline shutdown, not Biden's policies.

"Gas prices are rising because demand is increasing as the economy recovers from the pandemic," DeHaan said. "The Colonial Pipeline shutdown exacerbated the problem, but it is not the only factor."

Comparison to last year's gas prices is also misleading. Prices plummeted in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, not because of Trump administration policies.

"Gas prices were unusually low in 2020 because of the pandemic," DeHaan said. "It is not fair to compare current prices to those prices."

Despite the pipeline being back in operation, some states are still experiencing gas shortages.

"Some states are still experiencing gas shortages because the Colonial Pipeline shutdown caused a disruption in the supply chain," DeHaan said. "It will take some time for the supply chain to fully recover."

Lumber prices have also surged in recent months, but this is not due to Biden's policies.

"Lumber prices have increased because of increased demand and a sharp economic rebound," said Liz Cheney, a Republican representative from Wyoming. "Biden's policies have not had a significant impact on lumber prices."

Republicans have accused Biden's policies of being responsible for a 400% increase in lumber prices. However, this claim is unfounded.

"Lumber prices have increased by about 100% in the past year, not 400%," said Ronna McDaniel, head of the Republican National Committee. "Biden's policies have not caused this increase."

Rising prices in commodities like lumber are partly due to strong consumer demand for goods, a positive sign for the economy.

"The increase in lumber prices is a sign that the economy is recovering," said Cheney. "It is not a sign of Biden's failure."

In conclusion, the recent rise in gasoline and lumber costs is not due to Biden's policies. The gas price increases are primarily attributed to the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack and the global economic recovery. Lumber prices have surged due to increased demand and a sharp economic rebound.
