Panic-Buying Drains Gas Stations as Colonial Pipeline Shutdown Disrupts Fuel Supply

CLEMMONS, N.C. (AP) – Motorists across the Southeast faced long lines and empty gas pumps on Tuesday as panic-buying surged following a cyberattack that shut down the Colonial Pipeline, a major artery delivering 45% of the East Coast's fuel.

The Colonial Pipeline, which transports gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel from Texas to New Jersey, was forced to halt operations on Friday after a ransomware attack. The shutdown has raised concerns about potential fuel shortages, prompting a rush to gas stations in affected areas.

"We're seeing a lot of panic-buying," said Jeanette McGee, a spokeswoman for the AAA auto club. "People are filling up their tanks and extra gas cans, which is creating long lines and shortages."

Jamar Gatison, a construction worker and Uber Eats driver, said he waited in line for over an hour to fill up his truck. "I need gas for work and to make deliveries," he said. "This is really frustrating."

In North Carolina, 28% of gas stations were out of fuel as of Tuesday morning, according to GasBuddy. In some areas, such as Raleigh-Durham, the number was much higher, with 72% of stations reporting no gas.

"This is a serious situation," said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. "I have declared a state of emergency to ease fuel transportation into the state."

The national average price for a gallon of gasoline rose above $3 for the first time since 2016, according to AAA. The AAA predicts that over 37 million Americans will travel during the Memorial Day weekend, which could lead to a significant increase in fuel demand.

"We are working with the federal government and other states to coordinate efforts to prevent fuel shortages," said Cooper. "We are also allowing certain states to transport overweight loads of fuel."

The U.S. government is also taking steps to address the situation. The Department of Homeland Security is prepared to review Jones Act waiver requests to allow foreign-flagged vessels to transport fuel to affected areas.

"We are monitoring the situation closely and are taking all necessary steps to prevent fuel shortages," said White House press secretary Jen Psaki.

Despite the concerns, energy analysts and government officials have emphasized that there is no gasoline shortage. The issue is a distribution problem caused by the pipeline shutdown.

"We have plenty of gasoline in the United States," said Mair Martinez, a landscaper. "The problem is getting it to the gas stations."

Johnathan King, an employee of a towing company, said he has been working long hours to help stranded motorists. "We're seeing a lot of people running out of gas," he said. "It's a mess."

The Colonial Pipeline has not yet provided a timeline for when it expects to resume operations. The company is working with law enforcement and cybersecurity experts to investigate the attack and restore service as quickly as possible.

In the meantime, motorists are advised to conserve fuel and avoid unnecessary travel. They should also be prepared for higher gas prices and potential shortages.
