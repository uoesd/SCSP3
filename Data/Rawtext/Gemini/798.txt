False Claim: Fourth Stimulus Payment of $2,000 by Memorial Day

A social media claim alleging a fourth stimulus payment of $2,000 per person by Memorial Day weekend is false. Congress has not approved any such payment as part of COVID-19 relief.

Three Rounds of Stimulus Payments Authorized

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress has authorized three rounds of direct stimulus payments:

  • First Round (March 2020): Up to $1,200 per person
  • Second Round (December 2020): Up to $600 per person
  • Third Round (March 2021): Up to $1,400 per person

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is still distributing the third round of payments.

Misinformation Regarding Stimulus Payments and Child Tax Credit

Misinformation has been circulating regarding a fourth round of stimulus payments and incorrect child tax credit amounts. The child tax credit for 2021 will provide $250 to $300 per child between July and December, not $300 to $500 as claimed.

Congressional Support for Recurring Payments

Over 50 House members and 21 senators have expressed support for recurring stimulus payments. However, no action has been taken on this proposal.

White House Response

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki stated, "The discussion about a fourth round of payments is up to Congress."

Third-Round Stimulus Payments Update

As of May 14, 2021, the IRS has sent 164 million payments totaling $386 billion in the third-round stimulus.

Conclusion

The claim of a fourth $2,000 stimulus payment by Memorial Day is false. Congress has only approved three rounds of stimulus payments. The IRS is still distributing the third round of payments, and the child tax credit for 2021 will provide $250 to $300 per child between July and December.
