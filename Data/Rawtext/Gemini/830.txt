Tiger Woods Suffers Serious Injuries in Car Accident Hours After Golfing with Dwyane Wade

Retired NBA champion Dwyane Wade was among the celebrities who spent time with Tiger Woods on the golf course just hours before the legendary golfer's serious car accident.

On Tuesday, Wade, actor David Spade, and other celebrities joined Woods for a Golf Digest and GOLFTV content shoot at Rolling Hills Country Club in Los Angeles County. Wade shared a video on Instagram teasing his lesson with Woods, captioning it, "I'm ready to take my golf game to the next level with the GOAT."

Tragically, hours later, Woods was involved in a single-car accident near Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes. The accident caused major damage to Woods' vehicle, and he was rushed to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.

"It's a tough day," Wade said in a statement. "Tiger is one of the greatest athletes of all time, and he's inspired so many people, including myself. I'm praying for a speedy recovery."

Woods underwent emergency surgery for significant orthopedic injuries, according to a statement from his team.

"Mr. Woods suffered significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity that were treated during emergency surgery by orthopedic trauma specialists at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center," the statement read. "Comminuted open fractures affecting both the upper and lower portions of the tibia and fibula bones were stabilized by inserting a rod into the tibia. Additional injuries to the bones of the foot and ankle were stabilized with screws and pins. Trauma to the muscle and soft-tissue of the leg required extensive surgical repair."

Dr. Anish Mahajan, Chief Medical Officer at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, said Woods was "awake, responsive, and recovering in his hospital room."

"Mr. Woods' injuries are serious and require significant care, but his outlook is positive," Mahajan said. "We are committed to providing the best possible care and will continue to monitor his condition and provide updates as they become available."

Woods' accident has sent shockwaves through the sports world and beyond. Wade, who is a three-time NBA champion, expressed his admiration for Woods and his impact on the Black community.

"Tiger has been a pioneer for the game of golf," Wade said. "He's inspired so many people in the Black community to take up the game. He's a role model and an inspiration, and we're all praying for his recovery."

Woods' team has asked for privacy during this time and has thanked the public for their support.
