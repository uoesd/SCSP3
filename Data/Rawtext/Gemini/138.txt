Chris Wallace Departs Fox News for CNN's Streaming Service

Veteran journalist Chris Wallace has announced his departure from Fox News after 18 years, marking a significant shift in the media landscape.

"After 18 years, this is my final broadcast for Fox News," Wallace said during his last episode of "Fox News Sunday." "I want to try something new, to go beyond politics to all the things I'm interested in."

Wallace's exit coincides with the expiration of his contract, as reported by Variety. He will join CNN's upcoming streaming service, where he will host a new interview show.

"I'm thrilled to join CNN+," Wallace said in a statement released by CNN. "I look forward to exploring the world of streaming and the incredible flexibility it provides for telling stories and conducting interviews."

Fox News expressed its gratitude for Wallace's contributions. "We are extremely proud of Chris Wallace's accomplishments over his 18 years with Fox News," the network said in a statement. "Fox News Sunday will continue with a rotation of anchors until a permanent host is named."

Wallace's departure has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised his decision to seek new opportunities, while others have expressed concerns about the potential impact on Fox News' credibility.

Bret Baier, Wallace's colleague at Fox News, tweeted: "Chris Wallace is a legend in the industry. His legacy at Fox News is one of integrity, fairness, and hard-hitting journalism. We wish him all the best in his new endeavors."

However, Tucker Carlson and other Fox personalities have remained silent on Wallace's exit. Wallace had previously expressed dissatisfaction with Fox's airing of Carlson's series "Patriot Purge," which included conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.

Wallace's departure is part of a series of recent high-profile media changes. Brian Williams left NBC earlier this year, and CNN fired Chris Cuomo in December.

Wallace is known for his tough interviewing style and has moderated two presidential debates in 2016 and 2020. Despite criticism, he has defended his impartiality, arguing that CNN and MSNBC also have opinion-based programming that pushes a liberal agenda.

"I'm not a liberal," Wallace said in a 2020 interview with The New York Times. "I'm not a conservative. I'm a journalist. I try to be fair and objective."

Wallace's departure from Fox News marks the end of an era for the network. It remains to be seen how his absence will affect the network's ratings and reputation.
