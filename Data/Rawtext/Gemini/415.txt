Chauvin to Face Solo Trial in George Floyd's Death

Minneapolis, Minnesota - Derek Chauvin, the former police officer charged with murder in the death of George Floyd, will be tried alone due to COVID-19 physical distancing requirements, a judge ruled on Friday.

The trial for the three other officers charged with aiding and abetting in Floyd's death will start on August 23.

Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill said the physical limitations of the courtroom prevent a joint trial for all four defendants starting March 8.

"The court finds that the physical limitations of the courtroom, combined with the need to maintain social distancing, make it impractical to conduct a fair and impartial joint trial for all four defendants," Cahill wrote in his order.

Jury selection for Chauvin's trial is scheduled for March 8 to 26, with opening statements no earlier than March 29.

The other officers - Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng, and Tou Thao - will remain joined for their trial in the summer.

Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, declined to comment on the ruling.

The court's decision comes as COVID-19 continues to pose a public health emergency, influencing the court's ability to conduct trials safely.

Chauvin was charged with second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes during an arrest.

Chauvin posted $1 million bail and was allowed to live in a neighboring state for safety concerns.

All four officers involved in the incident have been fired.

The separate trials for Chauvin and the other officers are expected to draw intense public interest and scrutiny. The outcome of the trials could have a significant impact on the national conversation about race and policing.

Background on the Case

George Floyd's death sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform across the United States and around the world.

Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, but the charges were later upgraded to second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter.

The three other officers were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.

The charges against the officers stem from their alleged roles in Floyd's death. Chauvin is accused of kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, while Lane, Kueng, and Thao are accused of failing to intervene.

The trials are expected to be closely watched by the public and could have a significant impact on the national conversation about race and policing.
