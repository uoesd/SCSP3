Washington Post Staff Escapes Kabul Amidst Deteriorating Security

KABUL – Two days after the Taliban seized control of Kabul, Washington Post staff were offered a chance to escape on a chartered plane to Qatar. The journey to the airport, however, proved to be the most perilous part of their evacuation.

Security around Kabul's airport was rapidly deteriorating, with Taliban checkpoints springing up throughout the city. Washington Post reporter Aziz Tassal and his daughter had already experienced the brutality of the Taliban firsthand, having been beaten by fighters while trying to flee.

"They hit me with their rifle butts and kicked me," Tassal recounted. "They were saying, 'You're a spy, you're a spy.'"

The Biden administration was escalating evacuation plans, but could not guarantee safe passage to the airport. British troops assisted the Post group in bypassing a Taliban checkpoint, but the journey was far from over.

"We had to rent armored cars for our safety," said Tassal. "We saw desperate families and damaged vehicles along the way."

Upon reaching the military base, there were initial fears that no charter planes would land that day. However, an American military officer arranged for the group to leave on a U.S. military flight to Qatar.

The flight was packed with mostly Afghans, with seats removed to accommodate more people.

"It was a very emotional moment," said Tassal. "We were all relieved to be leaving, but we also knew that we were leaving behind a country in chaos."

The Perilous Journey to the Airport

The journey to the airport was a harrowing experience for the Post staff. Taliban checkpoints were scattered throughout the city, and the group faced dangerous conditions and threats along the way.

"We had to drive through a lot of Taliban checkpoints," said Tassal. "They were stopping cars and searching them. We were worried that they would find our passports and visas."

The group also encountered desperate families and damaged vehicles on the road.

"We saw people trying to flee on foot, with their children and belongings," said Tassal. "We also saw cars that had been damaged by gunfire."

The Evacuation Process

The Biden administration was escalating evacuation plans, but could not ensure safe passage to the airport. British troops assisted the Post group in bypassing a Taliban checkpoint, but the journey was still dangerous.

"The Biden administration was doing everything they could to evacuate people," said Tassal. "But the situation on the ground was very chaotic."

The Flight to Qatar

Upon reaching the military base, there were initial fears that no charter planes would land that day. However, an American military officer arranged for the group to leave on a U.S. military flight to Qatar.

The flight was packed with mostly Afghans, with seats removed to accommodate more people.

"It was a very emotional moment," said Tassal. "We were all relieved to be leaving, but we also knew that we were leaving behind a country in chaos."

The Aftermath

The Post staff arrived safely in Qatar, but they are still concerned about the fate of their colleagues and the people of Afghanistan.

"We are grateful to be safe," said Tassal. "But we are also thinking about our colleagues who are still in Afghanistan. We are also thinking about the people of Afghanistan, who are facing a very uncertain future."
