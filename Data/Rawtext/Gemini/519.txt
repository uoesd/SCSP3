Tugboat Crew Bravely Weathers Hurricane Ida's Fury at Port Fourchon

Port Fourchon, LA - As Hurricane Ida unleashed its wrath upon the Louisiana coast, a courageous tugboat crew aboard the Brittany Lynn found themselves trapped at Port Fourchon, facing the full force of the Category 4 storm.

Relief Captain Shannon Dryden and his team had been unable to evacuate before Ida's arrival, leaving them stranded at the mercy of the tempest. As the hurricane roared ashore with 150-mph winds and a devastating storm surge, the crew endured harrowing conditions that tested their limits.

"It was like being in a washing machine," Dryden recounted. "The visibility was zero, and the winds were so strong they were ripping the paint off the boat."

Amidst the chaos, a moment of terror struck when their barge was struck by loose boats, breaking it free. With the storm raging around them, the crew fought desperately to secure the barge again.

"We were all holding on for dear life," Dryden said. "We knew if we lost the barge, we would be in serious trouble."

As the eye of the storm passed, the crew managed to regain control of the barge. However, their ordeal was far from over. The back side of the hurricane brought additional challenges, including more high winds and heavy rain.

"It was like we were in a boxing match with a heavyweight," Dryden said. "Every time we thought we had it under control, it would come back and hit us again."

Approximately 40 boats with around 300 people were at Port Fourchon during the landfall. Miraculously, no major injuries were reported, according to Chett Chiasson, executive director of the Greater Lafourche Port Commission.

"We are incredibly grateful that everyone made it through this storm safely," Chiasson said. "The tugboat crew on the Brittany Lynn deserves special recognition for their bravery and resilience."

Dryden, who has been a captain for over 20 years, admitted that he would never choose to ride out a storm on a boat again.

"It was the most terrifying experience of my life," he said. "I'm just glad we all made it out alive."

The tugboat crew's harrowing tale serves as a reminder of the immense power of nature and the extraordinary courage of those who face it head-on. Their story is a testament to the human spirit's ability to overcome adversity and emerge stronger on the other side.
