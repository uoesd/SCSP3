Newsom Unveils $100 Billion California Comeback Plan, Including $600 Stimulus Checks

In a bold move to address the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a $100 billion California Comeback Plan that includes expanding the Golden State Stimulus to provide $600 checks to Californians earning up to $75,000.

"We are proposing the largest state tax rebate in American history," Newsom declared during a press conference on Wednesday. "This is a direct stimulus to help people who are struggling right now."

The proposal, which leverages $26 billion in federal relief funds, also includes $5.2 billion for rent relief, $2 billion for utility bill assistance, and $1 billion in college grants.

Golden State Stimulus Expansion

The expanded Golden State Stimulus would provide $11.9 billion for $600 payments to an estimated 15 million Californians. This represents a significant increase from the initial stimulus, which provided $600 checks to low-income residents earning less than $30,000.

"This is a critical investment in our state's economic recovery," said Senator Nancy Skinner (D-Oakland), lead Democrat on the Senate budget committee. "It will put money directly into the pockets of Californians who need it most."

Rent Relief and Utility Assistance

The plan also includes $5.2 billion for rent relief, which will be distributed through local agencies to help tenants pay down back rent and prevent evictions. An additional $2 billion will be allocated to assist millions of Californians in catching up on utility bills.

"This is a lifeline for renters and utility customers who have been struggling during the pandemic," said Phil Ting (D-San Francisco), Assembly counterpart to Skinner. "It will help keep people in their homes and ensure they have access to essential services."

Economic Disparity and Political Criticism

Newsom emphasized that the plan aims to address the economic disparity caused by the pandemic, which has disproportionately impacted low-wage workers and people of color.

"We know that the pandemic has not impacted everyone equally," Newsom said. "This plan is designed to help those who have been hit the hardest."

However, Republican challengers have criticized the plan as politically motivated, given the impending recall election.

"This is nothing more than a desperate attempt to buy votes," said John Cox, a Republican gubernatorial candidate. "Newsom is trying to distract voters from his failures by throwing money at them."

Kevin Faulconer, former San Diego mayor and another Republican gubernatorial candidate, echoed Cox's sentiments.

"This is a reckless spending spree that will only lead to higher taxes and more debt," Faulconer said.

Support for Undocumented Immigrants

Advocates for undocumented immigrants have pushed for greater relief in the plan, as this population has been largely excluded from federal relief.

"Undocumented immigrants are essential workers who have been on the front lines of this pandemic," said Anna Hasselblad, public policy director for United Ways of California. "They deserve to be included in this stimulus package."

Eviction Moratorium Expiration

The state's eviction moratorium is set to expire on June 30, making the rent relief proposal particularly urgent.

"We need to act now to prevent a wave of evictions," Skinner said. "This plan will provide much-needed relief to tenants and help keep people in their homes."

Tax Filers and Eligibility

Under Newsom's plan, 78% of California tax filers would receive a stimulus payment. The payments would be phased out for individuals earning more than $75,000 and couples earning more than $150,000.

Conclusion

Newsom's $100 billion California Comeback Plan is a bold and ambitious attempt to address the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan includes a wide range of measures to provide direct relief to Californians, including stimulus checks, rent assistance, utility bill assistance, and college grants. While the plan has drawn criticism from Republicans, it has received support from Democrats and advocates for low-income residents and people of color. The plan is expected to be debated in the state legislature in the coming weeks.
