Chauvin Found Guilty in Floyd Murder, Faces Decades in Prison

CNN – Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds, was found guilty on Tuesday of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter.

The jury, composed of five men and seven women, reached the verdict after deliberating for about 10 hours over two days. The racial composition of the jury was six White, four Black, and two multiracial jurors.

Two alternate jurors, both White women, were dismissed before deliberations began.

The jury selection process, which began on March 9 and concluded on March 23, was closely watched as both the prosecution and defense used peremptory challenges to shape the jury based on their views on policing and the Black Lives Matter movement.

Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter. Sentencing is scheduled for eight weeks from now, and Judge Peter Cahill will determine the sentence.

The trial, which lasted approximately three weeks, included testimony from 45 witnesses, including Floyd's family members, eyewitnesses, police officers, and medical experts.

The prosecution argued that Chauvin's use of excessive force was unreasonable and that he caused Floyd's death by depriving him of oxygen. The defense argued that Chauvin was acting within the scope of his duties and that Floyd's death was caused by underlying health conditions and drug use.

The verdict is a major victory for the prosecution and for Floyd's family, who have been seeking justice for his death since May 25, 2020. It is also a significant moment in the national conversation about race and policing in the United States.

Three other former officers involved in Floyd's arrest and death – Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng, and Tou Thao – are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. Their trial is scheduled to begin on August 23.

Background of the Case

George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, a White police officer, kneeled on his neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds during an arrest for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill.

Floyd's death sparked widespread protests and unrest across the United States and around the world, as people demanded justice for his killing and an end to police brutality against Black people.

Chauvin was fired from the Minneapolis Police Department the day after Floyd's death, and he was arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter.

The Trial

The trial began on March 8 with jury selection. The jury was selected from a pool of 325 potential jurors, and the final 12 jurors and two alternates were chosen after a lengthy process of questioning and challenges from both the prosecution and defense.

The prosecution called 38 witnesses to testify, including Floyd's family members, eyewitnesses, police officers, and medical experts. The defense called seven witnesses, including Chauvin himself.

The prosecution's case focused on the excessive force used by Chauvin and the fact that he continued to kneel on Floyd's neck even after Floyd became unresponsive. The defense argued that Chauvin was acting within the scope of his duties and that Floyd's death was caused by underlying health conditions and drug use.

The jury deliberated for about 10 hours over two days before reaching a verdict.

The Verdict

The jury found Chauvin guilty on all three charges: second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter.

Second-degree murder is defined as causing the death of another person with intent, but without premeditation. Third-degree murder is defined as causing the death of another person through negligence. Second-degree manslaughter is defined as causing the death of another person through recklessness or culpable negligence.

Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter. Sentencing is scheduled for eight weeks from now, and Judge Peter Cahill will determine the sentence.

Reaction to the Verdict

The verdict was met with mixed reactions. Some people praised the jury for holding Chauvin accountable for his actions, while others expressed disappointment that he was not convicted of first-degree murder.

Floyd's family members said they were relieved by the verdict but that it did not bring back their loved one.

"Today, a jury in Minneapolis did the right thing," said Ben Crump, an attorney for the Floyd family. "But George Floyd should be here with us today."

Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, said
