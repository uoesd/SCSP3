Dwayne Johnson's Production Company Bans Real Guns in Wake of Rust Tragedy

In a bold move to enhance safety on film sets, actor and producer Dwayne Johnson has announced that his production company, Seven Bucks Productions, will no longer use real guns in any future projects. This decision comes in response to the tragic shooting on the set of the Western film Rust, which resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

"We are not going to use real guns anymore," Johnson stated unequivocally. "It's not worth the risk."

The Rust incident, which occurred in October 2021, sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry. Actor Alec Baldwin, who was holding the prop gun that discharged, fatally shot Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza. The shooting is still under investigation.

Baldwin expressed his devastation over the incident, calling it a "tragic accident." "I'm heartbroken," he said. "I can't imagine what Halyna's family is going through."

Johnson echoed Baldwin's sentiments, expressing his sympathy for Hutchins' family and the Rust set members. "My heart goes out to Halyna's family and everyone on that set," he said.

Johnson's decision to ban real guns is a significant step towards improving safety on film sets. He emphasized that the cost of implementing this rule is irrelevant compared to the potential risks involved.

"I don't care how much it costs," Johnson said. "We're not going to use real guns. We're going to use rubber guns."

Johnson's commitment to safety has been echoed by other industry professionals. Eric Kripke, showrunner of Amazon's The Boys, also pledged to not use real guns in future productions.

"I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that we never have a real gun on any of our sets," Kripke said. "I encourage everyone else in the industry to do the same."

The use of rubber guns instead of real guns has been gaining traction in the industry as a safer alternative. Rubber guns can be made to look and feel like real guns, but they are incapable of firing live ammunition.

Johnson's decision and the growing support for rubber guns represent a positive step towards creating a safer work environment for cast and crew on film sets. As the investigation into the Rust shooting continues, the industry is taking proactive measures to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.
