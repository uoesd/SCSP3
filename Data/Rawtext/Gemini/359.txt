FTC Revives Antitrust Case Against Facebook, Accusing It of Monopoly

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed an amended complaint against Facebook, alleging that the social media giant is a monopoly that has violated federal antitrust laws. This follows a previous dismissal of the FTC's lawsuit by a federal judge for lack of sufficient evidence.

In the amended complaint, the FTC accuses Facebook of engaging in "anticompetitive conduct" through acquisitions like Instagram and WhatsApp and placing restrictions on app developers. The FTC claims that these actions have stifled competition and harmed consumers.

"The FTC alleges that Facebook has engaged in a course of anticompetitive conduct that has harmed consumers," said FTC Chair Lina Khan. "We are seeking to restore competition to the online marketplace and protect the interests of consumers."

Facebook has criticized the FTC's ongoing legal action, asserting that their operations remain competitive and lawful. The company has also sought the recusal of FTC Chair Lina Khan from the lawsuit due to her past criticism of the company, but the FTC has rejected this request.

"We believe the FTC's case is legally and factually flawed, and we will defend ourselves vigorously," said a Facebook spokesperson.

The lawsuit could lead to the breakup of Facebook, demanding separations like that of Instagram and WhatsApp to restore competition. The action is part of a broader government initiative targeting big tech's allegedly anticompetitive practices, including suits against Google and potential probes into Amazon.

Background of the Case

The FTC initially filed its lawsuit against Facebook in December 2020, alleging that the company had engaged in anticompetitive conduct by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp and by imposing restrictions on app developers. However, in June 2021, U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the FTC had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims.

"The FTC has failed to plead enough facts to plausibly establish that Facebook has monopoly power in the relevant market," Judge Boasberg wrote in his ruling. "The FTC's complaint is therefore legally insufficient and must be dismissed."

The FTC appealed Judge Boasberg's ruling, and in August 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the case back to the district court, allowing the FTC to file an amended complaint.

The Amended Complaint

In its amended complaint, the FTC claims to have addressed the issues raised by Judge Boasberg in his previous ruling. The FTC has included additional data and detailed statistics to support its claims that Facebook has monopoly power and has engaged in anticompetitive conduct.

"We have carefully reviewed the court's decision and believe that our amended complaint addresses the concerns raised by the court," said FTC Chair Lina Khan. "We are confident that our case is strong and that we will ultimately prevail."

Facebook's Response

Facebook has criticized the FTC's amended complaint, arguing that it is still legally and factually flawed. The company has also accused the FTC of engaging in a "fishing expedition" and of trying to "rewrite history" by claiming that Facebook has monopoly power.

"The FTC's amended complaint is just as flawed as its original complaint," said a Facebook spokesperson. "We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously against these baseless allegations."

Potential Outcomes of the Lawsuit

If the FTC is successful in its lawsuit, it could lead to the breakup of Facebook. The FTC could demand that Facebook separate Instagram and WhatsApp from its main platform in order to restore competition. The FTC could also impose other restrictions on Facebook's business practices.

The lawsuit is part of a broader government initiative targeting big tech's allegedly anticompetitive practices. The Biden administration has made it a priority to crack down on big tech companies, and the FTC has been at the forefront of this effort.

The outcome of the FTC's lawsuit against Facebook could have a significant impact on the future of the tech industry. If the FTC is successful, it could lead to the breakup of one of the world's largest and most powerful companies.
