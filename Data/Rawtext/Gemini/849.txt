Tiger Woods' Car Crash: Black Box Data Sought in Investigation

TORRANCE, Calif. – Tiger Woods was involved in a single-car crash on Feb. 23 and told deputies he did not remember driving, according to a search warrant affidavit filed by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

At the crash scene and later at the hospital, Woods repeated he could not recall how the collision occurred, Deputy Johann Schloegl wrote in the affidavit.

"Mr. Woods stated that he did not know how the collision occurred and did not remember driving," Schloegl wrote.

The affidavit was submitted to obtain a search warrant for the vehicle's black box, which could provide data to assist in determining how and why the collision occurred.

"The black box data may contain information regarding the speed of the vehicle, braking, steering input, and other relevant data that may assist in determining the cause of the collision," Schloegl wrote.

The ongoing investigation into the crash is not a criminal investigation, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva.

"This is a traffic collision investigation," Villanueva said at a news conference. "We are not investigating a crime."

Investigators obtained a search warrant for the vehicle's black box but did not seek a warrant for Woods' blood sample due to lack of evidence of impairment.

"There was no evidence of alcohol or drugs at the scene," Villanueva said. "There was no odor of alcohol on his breath. He did not appear to be under the influence of any drugs."

Car accident reconstruction experts suggested Woods had a "very delayed response" to the emergency, indicating he might not have been paying attention.

"He was traveling at a high rate of speed and he did not brake until he was almost into the trees," said Brian Wolf, a car accident reconstruction expert. "That's a very delayed response."

No evidence of braking was found at the scene, with the vehicle traveling about 400 feet after hitting a median.

Woods has a history of a 2017 arrest for drunk driving and was found asleep at the wheel in Florida.

"Mr. Woods has a history of driving under the influence," Schloegl wrote in the affidavit. "This information is relevant to the investigation of the collision."

Woods is currently in good spirits and recovering from a surgical procedure on his back.

"He's doing well," Villanueva said. "He's in good spirits. He's recovering from his surgery."

The investigation into the crash is ongoing.
