Biden's COVID-19 Strategy: A Resounding Success

Washington, D.C. - President Biden's comprehensive COVID-19 strategy has achieved remarkable success, leading to the administration of 300 million vaccine doses within 150 days. This unprecedented vaccination drive has significantly lowered COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, bringing the nation closer to overcoming the pandemic.

A Slow Start, a Swift Turnaround

When President Biden took office in January 2021, only 5% of adult Americans were vaccinated against COVID-19. The initial pace of vaccinations was slow, with limited vaccine supply and insufficient distribution channels.

Recognizing the urgent need to accelerate the vaccination effort, the Biden Administration swiftly implemented a multifaceted strategy that included securing vaccine supply, increasing vaccination sites, and mobilizing federal personnel.

Securing Vaccine Supply

The Administration worked tirelessly to secure a steady supply of vaccines, negotiating with manufacturers to increase production and delivery schedules. This proactive approach ensured that there were ample vaccines available to meet the growing demand.

Expanding Vaccination Sites

To make vaccines more accessible to Americans, the Administration established over 81,000 vaccination sites across the country. This vast network of sites ensured that most Americans could get vaccinated within 5 miles of their homes.

The federal pharmacy vaccination program was also expanded to include 42,000 local pharmacies, administering over 82 million shots. Additionally, 39 federally-run, high-volume vaccination sites were set up, particularly in vulnerable neighborhoods.

Mobilizing Federal Personnel

The Administration deployed federal personnel to support vaccination efforts, including the National Guard, FEMA, and the Public Health Service. These personnel assisted with site setup, vaccine administration, and logistics, ensuring smooth and efficient operations.

Community Health Centers: A Vital Role

Community health centers played a significant role in the vaccination effort, especially for the poverty-line population and racial/ethnic minorities. These centers hosted almost 11,000 pop-up clinics, bringing vaccines directly to underserved communities.

Equity at the Forefront

The Biden Administration emphasized equity in vaccine distribution, with a majority of federally-provided shots going to people of color. The Administration also supported over 20,000 community-based pop-up vaccination clinics, targeting areas with low vaccination rates.

Results that Speak Volumes

The success of the Biden Administration's COVID-19 strategy is evident in the dramatic decline in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. As of July 4, 2021, over 175 million Americans have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, with 65% of adult Americans having gotten at least one shot and 55% being fully vaccinated.

A Call to Action

While significant progress has been made, the Biden Administration urges all Americans to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Vaccination is the most effective way to protect oneself, loved ones, and the community from COVID-19.

The Administration continues to work diligently to ensure that every American has access to a COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of their location, background, or financial means. Together, we can defeat this pandemic and build a healthier future for all.
