Ever Given Remains Stuck in Suez Canal Dispute

The Ever Given, the 20,124 teu vessel that blocked the Suez Canal for six days in March, remains anchored in the canal's Great Bitter Lakes area, over two months after being refloated.

The ship and its 18,000 teu of cargo are under arrest due to a compensation dispute between the owners and the Suez Canal Authority (SCA). The SCA initially demanded $916 million in compensation, which has since been lowered to $550 million. However, the shipowner has offered only $150 million.

North European importers with cargo on the Ever Given are considering abandoning it due to the ongoing delays. "We are looking at the possibility of abandoning the cargo," said Mathu Jagannath, director of NAU Pte. "The delays are costing us a lot of money."

The SCA attributes the accident to the ship's "excessive speed," while the P&I Club, which insures the ship, blames the SCA's control over navigation.

Cargo owners are required to contribute to salvage costs due to the declaration of General Average, but cannot do so until the vessel is freed.

The Ever Given is worth $183 million, with its value increasing by $13 million since the grounding. It is unclear if Evergreen, the operator leasing the vessel, continues to pay daily hire while it is under arrest.

The shortage and high demand for containership capacity make it urgent for Evergreen to return the Ever Given to service. "The longer this dispute drags on, the more it will cost everyone involved," said Jagannath. "The SCA and the shipowner need to resolve this quickly to minimize the losses."
