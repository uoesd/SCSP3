Facebook Shuts Down Pro-Israel Page with 77 Million Followers

New York, NY - Facebook has removed the "Jerusalem Prayer Group" page, which had amassed a staggering 77 million followers, citing violations of its rules against spam and inauthentic behavior. The page's founder, Mike Evans, alleges that the shutdown was orchestrated by a "cyber terrorism" campaign orchestrated by radical Islamic groups.

"This is cyber terrorism based upon racism," Evans asserted. "This is a coordinated effort to shut down the voice of 77 million people who support Israel."

Evans, who is also the head of the Friends of Zion Association, claims that the campaign involved over a million comments, including anti-Semitic content such as photos of and quotes by Hitler. He was informed of the page's removal upon arriving in Israel to host a star-studded TV special.

"I was in Israel to host a TV special with 250 million viewers, and I get a message that my page has been taken down," Evans said. "I'm shocked and appalled."

Facebook had previously removed over 200 "fake accounts" for inauthentic behavior in May 2019. Evans claims he has not been able to contact Facebook representatives since the page was shut down and that he cannot post to his personal Facebook page.

"I've reached out to everyone I can think of," Evans said. "I've called Sen. Lindsey Graham, Sen. Ted Cruz, Jared Kushner, Mike Pompeo. I've called everyone I can think of."

A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the page's removal, stating, "We removed the 'Jerusalem Prayer Group' page for violating our policies against spam and inauthentic behavior."

The shutdown of the Jerusalem Prayer Group page has sparked outrage among its supporters, who accuse Facebook of bias against pro-Israel content. Evans has labeled the action as "a disgrace" and "a betrayal of the Jewish people."

"This is a dark day for freedom of speech," Evans said. "Facebook has become a tool of the radical left."

The controversy surrounding the Jerusalem Prayer Group page comes amid international concerns over the escalating violence in Gaza. President Biden has reportedly pressured Israel to reduce its military actions, citing the increasing civilian death toll.

"We are deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of civilians in Gaza," Biden said in a statement. "We call on all parties to exercise restraint and to protect civilians."

The Israeli government has defended its actions, claiming that it is targeting Hamas militants who have fired thousands of rockets into Israel. However, the international community has expressed growing concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

The shutdown of the Jerusalem Prayer Group page has added to the tensions surrounding the conflict in Gaza. Evans has vowed to continue fighting for the page's reinstatement, while Facebook has maintained that it will not tolerate violations of its policies.
