Senate Republicans Block Bill for Bipartisan Jan. 6 Commission

Washington, D.C. - In a setback for efforts to investigate the January 6th Capitol riot, Senate Republicans on Tuesday voted to block a bill that would have created a bipartisan commission to probe the attack. The vote effectively kills the measure, dealing a blow to President Joe Biden's push for a thorough and independent examination of the events that led to the insurrection.

Republican Opposition

Republican leaders argued that the commission would duplicate other investigations and should also examine violence during last summer's racial justice protests. They also expressed concerns about the potential for the commission to become politicized.

"This is not about getting to the truth," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). "This is about creating a political sideshow."

Biden's Disbelief

President Biden expressed disbelief that anyone would vote against the commission, emphasizing the severity of the Capitol assault.

"I can't believe there's a single member of the United States Senate who would vote against finding out everything that led to the January 6th attack on our democracy," Biden said.

Bipartisan Support

Despite Republican opposition, six Republican Senators voted in favor of advancing the bill: Mitt Romney (Utah), Ben Sasse (Nebraska), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Bill Cassidy (Louisiana), Rob Portman (Ohio), and Susan Collins (Maine). However, the measure failed to overcome the 60-vote filibuster threshold, effectively killing the bill.

Schumer's Criticism

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized the vote, suggesting politics prevailed over truth and possibly hinted at another vote on the bill in the future.

"Today, the Senate failed our country and failed our democracy," Schumer said. "Politics prevailed over truth, and accountability was sacrificed at the altar of partisan expediency."

McConnell's Dismissal

McConnell dismissed the commission as a "purely political exercise" and suggested focusing on the current administration's policies instead.

"The American people are not interested in relitigating the past," McConnell said. "They want us to focus on the future and on the challenges facing our country today."

Murkowski's Dissent

Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski criticized Republican leadership's opposition to the bill, emphasizing the need for accountability for the Jan. 6 events.

"We cannot sweep what happened on January 6th under the rug," Murkowski said. "The American people deserve to know what happened that day, and they deserve to know who is responsible."

McCarthy's and McConnell's Arguments

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and McConnell argued that the commission would interfere with other investigations and should examine other violent protests.

"We need to focus on the future, not the past," McCarthy said. "This commission is nothing more than a political stunt."

House Passage

The bill, which failed in the Senate, had passed in the Democratic-led House with support from 35 Republican members.

Pelosi's Hint

Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) hinted at the possibility of forming a separate panel to investigate the riot if a bipartisan commission could not be established.

"We will not let the truth be buried," Pelosi said. "We will not let the insurrectionists get away with their crimes."

Other Reactions

Democratic Senator Joe Manchin (W.Va.) expressed disappointment with the vote, saying it was "a sad day for our democracy."

"We have a responsibility to get to the bottom of what happened on January 6th," Manchin said.

No. 2 Senate Democrat Dick Durbin (Ill.) called the vote "a victory for the insurrectionists."

"The American people deserve to know the truth about what happened on January 6th," Durbin said.

Representative Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), Chair of the Oversight Committee, said the vote was "a betrayal of our democracy."

"The American people deserve answers about what happened on January 6th," Maloney said.

Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), House Intelligence Committee chair, said the vote was "a disgrace."

"The American people deserve to know the truth about what happened on January 6th," Schiff said.

Gladys Sicknick, mother of the late Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died after the riot, expressed her disappointment with the vote.

"I am heartbroken that the Senate has failed to stand up for the truth and for the memory of my son," Sicknick said.

Conclusion

The Senate's rejection of the bipartisan commission bill is a setback for efforts to investigate the January 6th Capitol riot. The vote highlights the deep partisan divide over the issue and raises questions about the future of accountability for the attack on the U.S. Capitol.
