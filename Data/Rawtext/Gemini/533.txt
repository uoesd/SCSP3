Kabul Airport Attack: Suicide Bombers, Gunmen Kill 60 Afghans, 13 U.S. Troops

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) – Two suicide bombers and gunmen attacked crowds at Kabul's airport on Thursday, killing at least 60 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops, in the deadliest day for American forces in Afghanistan in a decade.

The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the airport attack, which occurred amidst efforts to evacuate people following the Taliban's takeover and ahead of the U.S. withdrawal deadline of Aug. 31.

U.S. President Joe Biden vowed to retaliate against the perpetrators, saying, "We will hunt you down and make you pay."

"We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay," Biden said in a televised address from the White House.

General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, assured that evacuations would continue despite the attacks.

"We will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not allow them to stop us from completing our mission," McKenzie said.

The Taliban condemned the blasts and said they were not involved in the attack.

"The Islamic Emirate strongly condemns the bombing at Kabul airport, which targeted civilians and U.S. forces," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.

More than 140 Afghans were wounded in the blasts, according to Afghan health officials.

An Italian charity, Emergency, reported receiving at least 60 patients wounded in the airport attack.

"We are overwhelmed with wounded arriving from the airport attack," said Marco Puntin, manager in Afghanistan for Emergency. "Our staff is working around the clock to provide life-saving care."

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby and Gen. McKenzie acknowledged a security breach at the airport.

"We are still assessing the details of what happened, but it is clear that there was a security breach," Kirby said.

"We are working to determine how this happened and to prevent it from happening again," McKenzie said.

Several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, advised against going to the Kabul airport due to unspecified security threats.

The attacks occurred as the United States and its allies race to evacuate their citizens and Afghan allies before the Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline.

Acting U.S. ambassador to Kabul Ross Wilson said that the U.S. Embassy in Kabul is closed and that all American citizens should leave Afghanistan immediately.

"The security situation in Kabul is extremely dangerous, and we urge all U.S. citizens to leave Afghanistan immediately," Wilson said.

The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan on Aug. 15, after the U.S.-backed Afghan government collapsed. The Taliban's takeover has sparked chaos and fear in Afghanistan, and many people are desperate to leave the country.

The United States and its allies have evacuated more than 100,000 people from Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover. However, thousands of people remain stranded in Afghanistan, and it is unclear how many will be able to leave before the Aug. 31 deadline.

The airport attack is a major setback for the U.S. evacuation effort and raises serious questions about the security of the airport. It is unclear how the attacks will affect the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
