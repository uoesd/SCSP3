Royal Title Refusal: Harry and Meghan's Concerns Over 'Dumbarton' Title

Royal biographer Andrew Morton has shed light on the possible reasons behind Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision to decline a royal title for their son, Archie. According to Morton, the couple may have been apprehensive about the potential for bullying due to the word "dumb" in the title "Earl of Dumbarton."

"They were very concerned about the title 'Earl of Dumbarton' because of the potential for bullying," Morton explained. "It's a very unfortunate word, and they were worried about how it would affect Archie."

Morton emphasized that the concern was not about general bullying for being royal but specifically about mockery because of the title's name. "It's not just the usual bullying that comes with being a royal," he said. "This was a specific concern about the title itself."

However, there is some contention around whether Harry and Meghan had the choice in Archie's titled status. During an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Meghan offered a different version of events. She spoke about the Royal Family's reluctance to make Archie a prince, which differed from the protocol.

"They didn't want him to be a prince or a princess, which would be different from protocol," Meghan said. "And that he wasn't going to receive security."

Meghan's revelations highlight concerns about Archie's safety and the importance of his royal status in that context. The issue of denying Archie the prince title and the decision against the "Earl of Dumbarton" title may both be true, highlighting distinct concerns.

Morton views the refusal of the title as indicative of the Sussexes' sensitivity to their public image. "They are very aware of how they are perceived," he said. "They want to be seen as modern and progressive, and they don't want to be associated with anything that could be seen as negative."

The decision could also reflect a parental desire to protect Archie from potential bullying. Harry and Meghan's own experiences with public scrutiny and bullying could have influenced their protective stance. "They know what it's like to be bullied," Morton said. "They want to do everything they can to protect Archie from that."
