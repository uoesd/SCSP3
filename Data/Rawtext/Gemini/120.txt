Unvaccinated Husband's Battle with COVID-19 Highlights Delta Variant's Severity

CNN – Alicia Ball's husband, William, has been battling COVID-19 in a Mississippi hospital for over 22 days, a harrowing ordeal that has intensified concerns about the Delta variant's impact on unvaccinated individuals.

Alicia, who was vaccinated, recovered from COVID-19 in just 10 days, showcasing the vaccine's effectiveness. "I had a fever, body aches, and a cough," she said. "But I was able to recover at home."

The couple's contrasting experiences underscore the stark difference in outcomes for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. "It's like night and day," Alicia said. "My husband is fighting for his life, while I was able to recover quickly."

Initially, the Balls were hesitant to get vaccinated due to a lack of information on the virus's severity and the vaccine's effects. "We didn't know how bad COVID-19 could be," Alicia said. "And we were worried about the side effects of the vaccine."

However, Alicia's asthma condition prompted her to reconsider. "My doctor told me that I was at high risk for severe complications from COVID-19," she said. "So I decided to get vaccinated."

Mississippi, where the Balls reside, has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S., with only 34.4% of the population fully vaccinated. The state is also experiencing high transmission rates of COVID-19, with 336 cases per 100,000 people.

The Delta variant, which is more contagious and potentially more severe than previous strains, is spreading rapidly across the U.S., leading to increased safety restrictions and mask guidance.

While fully vaccinated individuals can still contract the Delta variant, symptoms are typically milder. "The vaccine is not 100% effective, but it does provide significant protection," said CNN's Chris Cuomo. "It's like wearing a seatbelt. It doesn't guarantee you won't get in an accident, but it greatly reduces your risk of serious injury."

Alicia Ball hopes sharing her story will encourage others, including family, friends, and church members, to get vaccinated. "I don't want anyone to go through what my husband is going through," she said. "The vaccine is safe and effective. It could save your life."
