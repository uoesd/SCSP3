House Intelligence Committee Probes CIA's Alleged Plots Against WikiLeaks and Assange

The House Intelligence Committee has launched an inquiry into the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) alleged plans to target WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, following a bombshell Yahoo News report that detailed the agency's covert operations.

"I was not briefed on any of these activities in 2017," said Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee chairman. "We're going to get to the bottom of this."

The committee has reached out to the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) for information on the alleged plots, which included plans to kidnap Assange and poison his associates.

The revelations have sparked outrage and calls for transparency and accountability. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and over 20 other groups have urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to drop Assange's prosecution based on these revelations.

Assange's lawyers plan to use the CIA's alleged misconduct to argue against his extradition from the UK to the US, where he faces espionage charges.

Former CIA Director Mike Pompeo reportedly pushed for aggressive measures against WikiLeaks, including considering assassination. White House lawyers reportedly vetoed the kidnapping plan, but other operations targeting WikiLeaks went ahead.

Pompeo acknowledged some truth in the Yahoo News story but denied any illegal plans to assassinate Assange.

"I never discussed killing Julian Assange with anyone in the Trump administration or anyone else," Pompeo said in a statement.

The Yahoo News report, based on interviews with former US officials, detailed deep divisions within the Trump administration about how to handle WikiLeaks and Assange. Some officials, including then-CIA Director Gina Haspel, opposed the more aggressive measures proposed by Pompeo.

The report has raised serious questions about the CIA's authority to conduct covert operations against American citizens and journalists.

"The CIA is not supposed to be targeting American citizens or journalists," said Schiff. "This is a very serious matter."

The House Intelligence Committee's inquiry is expected to shed light on the extent of the CIA's alleged plots against WikiLeaks and Assange. The committee has the authority to subpoena witnesses and documents, and its findings could have significant implications for the ongoing prosecution of Assange.

The revelations have also reignited the debate over the role of whistleblowers and the government's response to leaks of classified information.

"Julian Assange is a publisher who exposed war crimes and government corruption," said ACLU attorney Ben Wizner. "The CIA's alleged plots against him are an attack on the First Amendment and the public's right to know."

The House Intelligence Committee's inquiry is expected to continue for several months. The committee's findings could have a major impact on the ongoing prosecution of Assange and the future of CIA operations against American citizens and journalists.
