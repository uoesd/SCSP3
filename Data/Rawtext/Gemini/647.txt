UC Santa Cruz Condemns Rittenhouse Verdict, Calls for Accountability

The University of California, Santa Cruz, expresses profound disappointment and outrage over the not guilty verdict in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse. This verdict is a failure of accountability and a painful reminder of the systemic racism that continues to plague our society.

We stand in solidarity with those who are outraged by this outcome. The acquittal of Rittenhouse, who fatally shot two unarmed men and wounded another at a Black Lives Matter rally in Kenosha, Wisconsin, sends a dangerous message that violence against protesters will not be held accountable. This verdict echoes the recent trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed Black man, highlighting the deeply troubling race-related implications of such trials.

The distress and harm that race-related trials cause to BIPOC communities cannot be overstated. We reaffirm our campus community's unwavering commitment to disrupting systemic racism and creating a more just and equitable society. It is imperative that we reaffirm our shared values and support those who are impacted by these events.

The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) is available as a resource for support in building a more inclusive climate. Campus services such as Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) are available for those feeling impacted. The Office of Equity and Equal Protection (OEEP) can be contacted to report discrimination.

We urge all members of our campus community to come together in solidarity and support. Together, we can create a more just and equitable world where all people are treated with dignity and respect.
