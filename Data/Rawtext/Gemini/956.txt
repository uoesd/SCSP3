"QAnon Shaman" Offers to Testify Against Trump in Impeachment Trial

Washington, D.C. - In a surprising turn of events, Jacob Chansley, the infamous "QAnon Shaman" who stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, has offered to testify as a witness in former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.

Chansley, who was notably dressed in face paint, no shirt, and a fur hat with horns during the riot, is facing multiple charges, including civil disorder and obstruction. He is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday.

According to his lawyer, Albert Watkins, Chansley feels betrayed by Trump after not receiving a pardon for his actions during the insurrection. "He feels like he was led on," Watkins said. "He feels like he was betrayed."

Chansley and others claim they were incited by Trump to participate in the riot. Prosecutors, however, argue that Chansley led a group into the Senate chamber and left a threatening note.

"He was one of the first people to enter the Senate chamber," said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin. "He left a threatening note on the desk of Vice President Pence, saying, 'It's only a matter of time. Justice is coming.'"

Chansley called the FBI to admit his involvement, calling Pence a "child-trafficking traitor." He also claimed to have come to the Capitol at Trump's request.

"I came here at the request of the president," Chansley told the FBI. "I came here to stop the steal."

Watkins said Chansley is a "self-proclaimed leader" in the QAnon conspiracy theory movement. QAnon is a baseless conspiracy theory that alleges a global cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles is plotting against Trump.

"He's a true believer in QAnon," Watkins said. "He believes that Trump is fighting against this cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles."

Chansley's offer to testify against Trump is a significant development in the impeachment trial. It remains to be seen whether the Senate will accept his testimony, but it could potentially provide damning evidence against the former president.

"This is a very important witness," said Representative Jamie Raskin (D-MD), the lead impeachment manager. "He was there. He saw what happened. He can tell us what Trump's role was in inciting this violence."

Trump's defense team has not yet commented on Chansley's offer to testify. However, they have argued that Trump did not incite the riot and that his words were protected by the First Amendment.

The impeachment trial is scheduled to begin on February 9.
