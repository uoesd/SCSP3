Stimulus Debate Heats Up in Washington

BALTIMORE (WBFF/WKRC) – The debate over additional stimulus money for American families is heating up in Washington D.C. Previous COVID stimulus payments included amounts of $1,200, $600, and $1,400, with the last signed by President Biden in March 2021.

The American Rescue Plan expanded the federal Child Tax Credit, providing direct payments to families. Families receive $300 for each child under 6, and $250 for each child ages 6 to 17, between July and December of 2021. A family with one child under 6 will receive $1,800 by December 2021 through the advanced payments.

Families not normally filing a tax return could still benefit if they notified the IRS by November 15. These eligible families will receive half of their total Child Tax Credit in a single payment on December 15. Potential one-time payments are up to $1,800 for each child under 6, and up to $1,500 for each child ages 6 to 17.

The future of the expanded Child Tax Credit is uncertain, with the Biden administration aiming to make it permanent. However, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin wants to make changes to the Child Tax Credit payments.

Manchin has expressed concerns about the cost of the expanded credit and its potential impact on inflation. He has proposed limiting the payments to families with incomes below a certain threshold.

The debate over additional stimulus money is likely to continue in the coming weeks. The Biden administration is pushing for a package that includes additional direct payments, while some Republicans are opposed to any further spending.

The outcome of the debate will have a significant impact on American families. The expanded Child Tax Credit has already provided much-needed relief to many families, and making it permanent would provide long-term financial stability for millions of children.
