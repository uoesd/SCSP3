Colonial Pipeline Scheduling System Restored After Brief Outage

NEW YORK, May 18 – Colonial Pipeline's scheduling system, which was disrupted on Monday, is now back online, the company said on Tuesday.

The outage, which lasted for several hours, was due to efforts to harden the system following a recent cyberattack, not a new infection, Colonial said.

The cyberattack, which occurred on May 7, led to a week-long outage of the 5,500-mile pipeline, causing significant fuel supply disruptions in the southeastern United States.

The outage resulted in widespread fuel shortages, with thousands of U.S. southeast gas stations running dry. Colonial has been working to normalize fuel deliveries using its shipping nomination system, which is managed by a third-party company, Transport4 (T4).

T4 did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the incident.

Despite the restoration of the scheduling system, it was still operating slower than normal, Colonial said. As of Tuesday, over 10,400 filling stations were still without fuel, an improvement from the peak of over 16,000.

Fuel outages in several states including North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia have dropped below 50%.

Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, anticipated that the number of stations without gasoline would drop under 10,000 by Tuesday.

"The recovery is continuing, but it's still going to take some time to get back to normal," De Haan said.

Colonial said it is working to resolve the remaining issues with the scheduling system and to restore normal operations as soon as possible.

The cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline is a reminder of the growing threat of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure. The Biden administration has made cybersecurity a top priority, and is working to improve the resilience of the nation's infrastructure to cyberattacks.
