161 Million Stimulus Checks Disbursed, But Some May Need to Return Payments

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has distributed over 161 million third stimulus check payments totaling more than $386 billion since March 12, 2021. These payments include "plus-up" payments for individuals who were eligible for a larger amount based on their 2020 tax return.

While the majority of recipients have received their payments without issue, some may need to return all or a portion of the money they received if they were overpaid or received the payment in error.

Returning Stimulus Payments

The method of returning stimulus money depends on how the payment was received:

Paper Checks:

  • Write "VOID" on the back of the check.
  • Include a brief explanation for returning the check.
  • Mail the voided check to the following address:

U.S. Department of the Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service P.O. Box 7026 Philadelphia, PA 19101

EIP Card:

  • Contact the EIP Card customer service at 1-800-240-8100.
  • Request a refund of the payment.
  • The IRS will issue a check for the refund amount.

Direct Deposit:

  • Contact the IRS at 1-800-829-1040.
  • Request a refund of the payment.
  • The IRS will issue a check for the refund amount.

Income Cutoffs and Eligibility

To be eligible for the third stimulus check, individuals must meet certain income requirements. The income cutoffs are:

  • $80,000 for single filers
  • $120,000 for heads of household
  • $160,000 for married couples filing jointly

Individuals who earned more than these amounts in 2020 may have to return all or a portion of their stimulus payment.

Exceptions to Returning Payments

Individuals may not have to return stimulus payments received before filing their 2020 taxes if their income increased that year. This is because the IRS based the payment amount on the taxpayer's 2019 tax return or the information they provided when filing their 2020 taxes.

Ineligible Recipients

Certain individuals are ineligible for stimulus payments, including:

  • Deceased individuals
  • Nonresidents without a U.S. citizen spouse
  • Noncitizens who file federal taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)
  • Dependents
  • Recipients of duplicate payments

Returning Payments for Deceased Family Members

If a deceased family member received a stimulus payment, the return of the payment depends on the filer status and the tax year the IRS based the payment on.

Instructions for Returning Cashed or Deposited Checks

  • Write "VOID" on the back of the check.
  • Include a brief explanation for returning the check.
  • Mail the voided check to the address provided above.
  • Make a payment to the U.S. Treasury for the amount of the payment.
  • Notify the IRS by calling 1-800-829-1040.

Instructions for Returning Uncashed Checks

  • Write "VOID" on the back of the check.
  • Include a brief explanation for returning the check.
  • Mail the uncashed check to the address provided above.

Claiming Missing First or Second Stimulus Payments

Individuals who did not receive their first or second stimulus payments may claim them as a Recovery Credit Rebate on their 2020 taxes. The Recovery Credit Rebate is a tax credit that allows eligible individuals to receive the amount of the stimulus payment they were entitled to but did not receive.
