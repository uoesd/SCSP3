Missing Woman: Search Intensifies for Gabby Petito Last Seen in Utah

SALT LAKE CITY – Authorities are desperately searching for Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old woman who vanished while traveling through Utah and Wyoming with her boyfriend.

Petito embarked on a cross-country trip with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, on July 2 from Blue Point, New York. The couple documented their journey on social media, sharing breathtaking photos and videos from their adventures in Colorado, Southern Utah, Arches National Park, and Canyonlands National Park.

However, Petito's Instagram posts slowed down towards the end of August, and the last communication with her family on August 30 remains uncertain.

"We're just trying to find her," said Nichole Schmidt, Petito's mother. "We just want her home."

The last known location of Petito was Salt Lake City on August 21, confirmed through an Uber Eats order placed by her father, Joseph Petito.

"We believe they left Salt Lake City for Grand Teton National Park around August 24," said Joseph Petito. "We don't think they spent more than two days there."

Communication between Petito and her mother became sporadic after August 24, and her family began to worry. They also expressed concerns about the nature of Petito's relationship with Laundrie.

"There were some things that were said that made us concerned," said Nichole Schmidt. "We just want to know that she's okay."

On September 11, the Suffolk County Police Department in New York confirmed the retrieval of the van used by the couple. However, they provided no information on Laundrie's whereabouts.

"We have no information to suggest that Brian Laundrie is missing," said Suffolk County Police Detective Lieutenant Kevin Beyrer.

A case has officially been opened by the Suffolk County Police Department, and the public is urged to provide any information that could help locate Petito.

"We're asking for the public's help in finding Gabby," said Detective Lieutenant Beyrer. "Any information, no matter how small, could be crucial."

Petito's parents have established a Facebook page, "Find Gabby," for updates on the search and a GoFundMe page to help with expenses.

"We're not giving up hope," said Joseph Petito. "We're going to find Gabby."

Anyone with information about Gabby Petito's whereabouts is urged to contact the Suffolk County Police Department at 631-852-6555 or the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI.
