Russia's Social Networks Thrive Amid Facebook Outage

MOSCOW, Oct 5 – Russian social networks reported a surge in activity during Facebook's global outage on Monday, with officials seizing the opportunity to push for the development of sovereign internet platforms.

The outage, which affected an estimated 3.5 billion users worldwide, was caused by a faulty configuration change, according to Facebook. However, Russian officials claimed it highlighted the need for Russia to have its own independent social networks.

"This situation once again confirms the need for our country to have its own social networks," said Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for Russia's Foreign Ministry. "We cannot rely on foreign platforms that can be shut down at any moment."

Russia has been pressuring foreign tech firms to comply with its internet regulations, including a law requiring them to store data on Russian servers. The government has also conducted tests earlier this year to disconnect from the global internet, as part of efforts to protect itself from being cut off from foreign infrastructure.

During the Facebook outage, Vkontakte, Russia's largest social network, saw an 18% increase in video views and a 21% increase in messages. Its audience also increased by 19% compared to the day before the outage.

"We saw a significant increase in activity during the Facebook outage," said Marina Krasnova, Head of Vkontakte. "This shows that Russian users are ready to switch to domestic platforms if necessary."

Odnoklassniki, another popular Russian social network, also reported increased activity during the outage.

The surge in activity on Russian social networks during the Facebook outage is likely to further fuel the government's efforts to develop sovereign internet platforms. Russia has already invested heavily in developing its own internet infrastructure, including a national domain name system and a secure messaging system.

The government's push for internet sovereignty is part of a broader effort to assert greater control over the country's information space. In recent years, Russia has passed laws restricting online speech and requiring internet providers to block access to certain websites.

The Facebook outage has provided a timely reminder of the importance of internet sovereignty for Russia. The government is likely to use the outage to justify further efforts to develop its own independent internet infrastructure and reduce its reliance on foreign platforms.
