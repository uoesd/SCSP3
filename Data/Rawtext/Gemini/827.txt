Third Batch of California Stimulus Checks to Arrive on October 5

The third batch of California stimulus checks will be sent out on October 5, according to the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB). These payments are part of the Golden State Stimulus program, which was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on July 12.

"This third round of Golden State Stimulus payments will provide much-needed relief to millions of Californians who are still struggling with the economic impacts of the pandemic," said Newsom.

The size of the upcoming batch is currently unknown, but previous batches were sent to 2 million and 600,000 Californians respectively. It's estimated that about 9 million Californians are eligible for the payments.

This round will include mailed paper checks in addition to direct deposits. Payments are being sent in two-week intervals, with previous ones on August 27 and September 17.

The FTB provides a tool for estimating individual payment amounts. Eligibility and payment amounts vary based on previous stimulus qualification and claiming of dependents.

The Golden State Stimulus program is part of a $12 billion pandemic relief package signed by Newsom. The stimulus aims to address inequities and support those facing the greatest hardship due to the pandemic.

"These payments will help families put food on the table, pay their rent or mortgage, and cover other essential expenses," said Newsom. "We are committed to providing relief to Californians who need it most."
