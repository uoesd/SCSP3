Governor Cuomo Announces COVID-19 Vaccination Mandate for Healthcare Workers in New York State

New York, NY - Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for all healthcare workers in New York State by September 27. The mandate includes staff at hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, adult care, and other congregate care settings.

"We need to do everything we can to protect the most vulnerable New Yorkers from COVID-19," Governor Cuomo said. "This mandate will help ensure that healthcare workers are vaccinated and protected, and it will help stop the spread of the virus."

The mandate will be implemented through Section 16 Orders issued by the State Department of Health. These orders will require healthcare facilities to develop and implement mandatory vaccination policies. Exceptions will be allowed for individuals with religious or medical reasons.

"This mandate is an important step in protecting the health of our communities," said Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul. "We need to do everything we can to ensure that healthcare workers are vaccinated and protected, and this mandate will help us achieve that goal."

Currently, 75% of hospital workers, 74% of adult care facility workers, and 68% of nursing home workers in New York State are vaccinated. The vaccination rate among healthcare workers is lower than the general population, which is currently at 72%.

"The science is clear: vaccines are the best way to protect ourselves and others from COVID-19," said Dr. Howard Zucker, New York State Health Commissioner. "This mandate will help ensure that healthcare workers are vaccinated and protected, and it will help stop the spread of the virus."

Governor Cuomo also urged private businesses to implement vaccinated-only policies and school districts to mandate vaccinations.

"We need to do everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19," Governor Cuomo said. "I urge private businesses to implement vaccinated-only policies and school districts to mandate vaccinations. These measures will help protect our communities and save lives."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has authorized a third COVID-19 vaccine dose for New Yorkers with compromised immune systems. The CDC recommends an additional dose for people with severe immunocompromised conditions, including those receiving cancer treatment and organ transplants.

New Yorkers should consult their healthcare provider about the appropriateness of an additional vaccine dose.

The vaccination mandate for healthcare workers is based on scientific guidance and data that shows that vaccines are the best way to protect against COVID-19. The mandate will help reduce the spread of the virus and the Delta variant, which is more contagious than previous strains.

"This mandate is about protecting the health of our communities," Governor Cuomo said. "We need to do everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19, and this mandate will help us achieve that goal."
