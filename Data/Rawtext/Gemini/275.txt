Biden Hosts Global COVID-19 Summit, Unveils Comprehensive Strategy to End the Pandemic

Washington, D.C. - Today, President Biden hosted the Global COVID-19 Summit virtually alongside the United Nations General Assembly, bringing together world leaders, global health experts, and representatives from the private sector to galvanize a collective response to the ongoing pandemic and strengthen global health security.

The summit, themed "Ending the Pandemic and Building Back Better," focused on four key objectives: vaccinating the world, saving lives now, building back better, and calling the world to account through measurable targets.

Unveiling a Comprehensive Strategy

In his opening remarks, President Biden outlined a comprehensive strategy to achieve these objectives, emphasizing the need for global cooperation and urgency in addressing the pandemic and preparing for future health crises.

Vaccinating the World

Recognizing the critical role of vaccines in ending the pandemic, President Biden announced that the United States will donate an additional half-billion Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines to low and lower-middle-income countries, bringing the total U.S. commitment to over 1.1 billion doses.

This substantial donation is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to ensuring equitable access to vaccines around the world. The United States has already shipped over 160 million doses to more than 100 countries and territories.

Saving Lives Now

Beyond vaccines, the United States is also providing additional funding through USAID and the CDC to enhance global vaccine readiness and delivery. This funding will support efforts to train healthcare workers, strengthen supply chains, and improve data collection and surveillance.

The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is also committing over $383 million in political risk insurance to facilitate global vaccine shipments. This insurance will help mitigate risks for private sector companies involved in vaccine distribution, ensuring that vaccines reach those who need them most.

Building Back Better

The summit also highlighted the importance of investing in long-term global health security to prevent future pandemics. The United States has made significant investments in vaccine manufacturing facilities in Africa and India to boost production capacity for developing countries.

The Biden-Harris Administration is also calling for expanding global and regional production of COVID-19 vaccines and enhancing transparency about vaccine availability. This will help ensure that all countries have access to the vaccines they need to protect their populations.

Calling the World to Account

To ensure accountability and track progress, the summit emphasized the need for measurable targets. The United States supports a temporary waiver of intellectual property protections under the WTO's TRIPS Agreement for COVID-19 vaccines, which would allow developing countries to produce their own vaccines.

Strengthening Health Systems

Beyond the immediate response to COVID-19, the summit also recognized the importance of strengthening health systems around the world to prevent and respond to future health crises. USAID and CDC will provide nearly $1.4 billion to mitigate COVID-19 impacts and strengthen health systems, focusing on vulnerable populations and underserved communities.

Global Cooperation and Urgency

Throughout the summit, President Biden and other world leaders emphasized the need for global cooperation and urgency in addressing the pandemic. The summit served as a platform for countries to share best practices, coordinate efforts, and mobilize resources to end the pandemic and build back better.

Conclusion

The Global COVID-19 Summit was a critical step forward in the global response to the pandemic. The United States' leadership and commitment to equitable access to vaccines, strengthening health systems, and investing in long-term global health security will help save lives, end the pandemic, and build a more resilient world.
