Assistant Director on 'Rust' Set Faced Safety and Behavior Complaints

CNN – Dave Halls, the assistant director on the set of the film "Rust," has been accused of disregarding safety protocols, engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior, and failing to conduct proper safety meetings. These allegations have come to light following the tragic death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was shot and killed by a prop firearm that Halls handed to actor Alec Baldwin.

Maggie Goll, an IATSE Local 44 prop maker and licensed pyrotechnician who worked on the "Rust" set, has detailed several instances of Halls' alleged negligence. She claims that Halls failed to hold safety meetings, announce the presence of firearms on set, and ensure proper handling of weapons.

"There were no safety meetings held on set," Goll said. "Dave Halls would just say, 'We're going to do this,' and then we would do it. There was no discussion of safety protocols or anything like that."

Goll also accused Halls of failing to conduct proper safety protocols when a licensed pyrotechnician had a medical emergency on set. She claims that Halls asked to continue shooting, despite the safety concerns raised by the crew.

"Dave Halls was told that the pyrotechnician was having a medical emergency and that we needed to stop shooting," Goll said. "But he said, 'No, we're going to keep going.' He didn't care about our safety."

A crew member who worked on "Rust" corroborated Goll's account, saying that Halls was dismissive during safety meetings and reluctant to have guns inspected.

"Dave Halls would say, 'Oh, we don't need to do that,'" the crew member said. "He was very dismissive of safety concerns."

In addition to the safety concerns, Goll also reported allegations of sexual misconduct against Halls. She claims that Halls was too physically familiar with the crew, making inappropriate comments and touching people without their consent.

"Dave Halls would put his hands on people's shoulders or backs," Goll said. "He would make inappropriate comments about women's bodies. It was very uncomfortable."

Goll reported Halls' behavior internally and to the Directors Guild of America, but claims that no action was taken.

"I reported Dave Halls' behavior to the production company and to the Directors Guild of America," Goll said. "But nothing was done. He was allowed to continue working on the set."

The allegations against Halls have raised serious questions about the safety protocols on the "Rust" set and the role of the assistant director in ensuring the well-being of the crew. The investigation into Hutchins' death is ongoing, and it is unclear whether Halls will face any criminal charges.

However, the allegations against him have cast a shadow over the film industry and highlighted the importance of prioritizing safety on set.
