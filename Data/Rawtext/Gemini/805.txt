IRS Issues "Plus-Up" Payments to 1 Million Americans

Washington – The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has distributed additional stimulus cash, known as "plus-up" payments, to people who lost income in 2020. These payments target individuals whose 2020 tax returns indicate they qualified for more than they initially received from the first two stimulus rounds.

Over the past two weeks, more than 1 million "plus-up" payments totaling $2.5 billion have been issued. The IRS has sent out more than 8 million supplemental payments this year.

Another 900,000 payments were made to low-income individuals who don't typically file tax returns but did so this year to claim their stimulus money.

The third stimulus payment, authorized in March, offers up to $1,400 per person and is expected to reach 85% of households. Families can receive $1,400 per dependent, including for adult dependents over 17, with the amount phasing out at higher income levels.

The latest aid package also increases the child tax credit, with periodic payments beginning July 15, based on 2019 or 2020 tax returns. Eligible parents will receive $3,600 for each child under 6 and $3,000 for each child under 18, with at least half being paid over the summer.

The child tax credit has been made fully refundable, potentially making 20 million more children eligible.

Eligibility for Plus-Up Payments

To be eligible for a "plus-up" payment, individuals must meet the following criteria:

  • Filed a 2020 tax return
  • Claimed the Recovery Rebate Credit on their tax return
  • Received less than the full amount of the first or second stimulus payment based on their 2019 tax return

How to Claim a Plus-Up Payment

Individuals who believe they are eligible for a "plus-up" payment should file a 2020 tax return as soon as possible. The IRS will automatically calculate any additional payment owed.

Other Stimulus Payment Updates

The IRS is continuing to process and issue the third stimulus payments. As of May 21, over 160 million payments have been sent out, totaling over $380 billion.

The IRS encourages individuals to use the "Get My Payment" tool on its website to check the status of their payment.
