Texas Faces Looming Winter Power Outages, Warns New Report

Texas could experience widespread power outages this winter if extreme weather strikes, according to a new report from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). The report identifies Texas as the most at-risk state, potentially facing a 37% energy shortfall.

"The vulnerabilities exposed by Winter Storm Uri remain," said Mark Olson, NERC's manager of reliability assessments. "The electric and natural gas systems are still susceptible to extreme winter weather."

The warning comes after the deadly February storms that left millions of Texans without electricity and water, resulting in 210 deaths and over $50 billion in damages. Residents affected by the outages also encountered billing and insurance issues, with some receiving electric bills over $1,000 a day.

"We're very disappointed that ERCOT continues to be susceptible to extreme weather conditions," said John Moura, NERC's director of reliability assessment. "We've seen this movie before, and we don't want to see it again."

NERC advises power companies to prepare for extreme winter weather through emergency plans, drills, and generator readiness checks. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) plans to inspect 300 power plants over 21 days in December to prevent outages.

"We're working to make sure that we're prepared for the winter," said ERCOT CEO Brad Jones. "We're doing everything we can to prevent outages, but we can't control the weather."

NERC's report also indicates risk in the South and Midwest, but Texas remains the greatest concern. The Biden Administration declared a national disaster in Texas following the February storms.

"We're taking this very seriously," said Texas Governor Greg Abbott. "We're working with ERCOT and other stakeholders to make sure that we're prepared for whatever this winter brings."

Texans are urged to prepare for potential power outages by having emergency plans in place, including food, water, and warm clothing. They should also be aware of the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning from generators.

"We're asking Texans to be prepared," said Abbott. "We don't want to see a repeat of what happened in February."
