Alec Baldwin Breaks Silence on 'Rust' Shooting, Calls for Safety Overhaul

In his first public remarks since the fatal shooting on the set of the film "Rust," actor Alec Baldwin expressed deep sorrow and vowed to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation.

"This is a one in a trillion event," Baldwin said in an interview with ABC News. "I feel that someone is responsible for what happened, and I can't say who that is, but I know that it's not me."

Baldwin, who was holding the gun that discharged and killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, emphasized that he was told the weapon was a "cold gun," meaning it was supposed to be unloaded.

"I would never point a gun at anyone and pull the trigger without them saying, 'Action,'" Baldwin said. "I didn't pull the trigger."

The actor revealed that he has been speaking to the police daily and is cooperating with the investigation. However, he declined to comment on specific details of the incident, citing the ongoing nature of the probe.

"I can't answer that question because it's an active investigation," Baldwin said when asked about the possibility of criminal charges.

Baldwin expressed his condolences to Hutchins' family and friends and said he is "devastated" by her death. He also called for new safety measures on film sets to prevent future tragedies.

"I'm going to do everything I can to make sure this never happens again," Baldwin said. "I'm going to work with every organization I can to make sure this doesn't happen again."

Baldwin's wife, Hilaria, has been by his side throughout the ordeal. The couple has been attempting to maintain a low profile amid the intense media scrutiny.

"We're trying to get through this as a family," Hilaria Baldwin said. "We're trying to heal."

The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department is conducting a criminal investigation into the shooting. Sheriff Adan Mendoza said it is too early to comment on potential charges but emphasized that the tragedy was avoidable.

"This was a completely avoidable tragedy," Mendoza said. "This was a criminal investigation."

Assistant director Dave Halls, armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed, and prop master Sarah Zachry have all been mentioned in relation to the handling of the gun.

"We're going to investigate every single person who handled that weapon," Mendoza said. "We're going to find out what happened."

The investigation is ongoing, and no charges have been filed at this time.
