U.S. Marine Killed in Afghanistan Airport Attack Welcomes Daughter Posthumously

A U.S. service member killed in the tragic Afghanistan airport attack on August 26th has been posthumously welcomed as a father. Rylee McCollum, a 20-year-old lance corporal, lost his life in the attack that claimed over 100 civilian lives. His widow, Jiennah, gave birth to their daughter, Levi Rylee Rose McCollum, on September 13th in San Diego.

The birth of Levi Rylee Rose was announced on Facebook by both Jiennah and her mother, Jill Miller Crayton. The newborn weighed 8 lbs., 10 oz. at birth. In her Facebook post, Jiennah expressed her gratitude for the outpouring of support she had received and shared her joy at welcoming her daughter. However, she also acknowledged the bittersweet nature of the moment, as her husband was not there to share it with them.

"I'm so happy to finally have her here, but it's hard not to be sad that her daddy isn't here with us," Jiennah wrote.

McCollum's death has left an immeasurable void in the lives of his family and friends. He had always aspired to join the Marines, a dream he had held since he was three years old. His dedication and sacrifice have been honored by the outpouring of support from the community.

A GoFundMe page set up for McCollum's family and daughter's upbringing has raised over $675,000. The funds will help provide financial stability for Jiennah and Levi Rylee Rose as they navigate life without their beloved husband and father.

The attack on the Kabul airport was claimed by ISIS-K, a branch of the Islamic State. It resulted in at least 20 Marines wounded and more than 170 people killed. The tragedy has highlighted the dangers faced by U.S. service members serving overseas and the sacrifices made by their families.

In her Facebook post, Jiennah mourned her husband's death and expressed her sorrow that he would not be able to witness their daughter's milestones.

"I wish you were here to hold her and see her," Jiennah wrote. "You would be the best daddy."

Despite the pain of her loss, Jiennah has found solace in the birth of her daughter. Levi Rylee Rose is a testament to the love and legacy of her father, Rylee McCollum, who will forever be remembered as a hero.
