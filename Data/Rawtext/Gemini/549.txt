Kabul Airport Bombing: 13 U.S. Service Members, Over 150 Afghan Civilians Killed

Kabul, Afghanistan - A horrific bombing and shooting outside Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul on Thursday claimed the lives of 13 U.S. service members and more than 150 Afghan civilians, marking a tragic end to the United States' 20-year war in Afghanistan.

The Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), a regional affiliate of the Islamic State and a rival of the Taliban, has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack.

ISIS-K: A Growing Threat

ISIS-K, founded by former members of the Pakistani Taliban, the Afghan Taliban, and others, seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate in the historical region of Khorasan, which includes Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Iran. The group is known for its extreme views, especially regarding women and ethnic minorities, and has conducted deadly attacks against civilians.

"ISIS-K is a sworn enemy of the Taliban and has made clear that it will not rest until it has overthrown the Taliban and established its own brutal rule in Afghanistan," said Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a U.S. Central Command spokesman.

U.S. Withdrawal and Retaliation

The Kabul airport attack occurred as the U.S. completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan, marking the end of a 20-year war that began in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

President Joe Biden vowed retaliation against ISIS-K for the attack, stating, "We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay." The U.S. has since carried out drone strikes killing top ISIS-K members.

Taliban's Role

The rivalry between the Taliban and ISIS-K means that the former is unlikely to offer safe haven to ISIS-K members. However, concerns remain about how the Taliban will police ISIS-K and the potential for disruptions in a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.

"The Taliban has a vested interest in preventing ISIS-K from gaining a foothold in Afghanistan," said Urban. "But it remains to be seen whether they have the capacity and will to effectively counter the threat."

America's Exit and ISIS-K's Opportunity

America's exit from Afghanistan could benefit ISIS-K, despite the group's recent territorial and leadership losses. The withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces has created a vacuum that could be exploited by ISIS-K and other extremist groups.

"The departure of U.S. and NATO forces has left a void that could be filled by ISIS-K and other terrorist organizations," said Biden. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely and take all necessary steps to protect our interests and the interests of our allies."

Conclusion

The Kabul airport bombing is a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by terrorism, even as the U.S. ends its longest war. The rise of ISIS-K and the Taliban's control of Afghanistan create a complex and dangerous situation that will require continued vigilance and cooperation from the international community.
