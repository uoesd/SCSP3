FBI Warned of Potential Violence Ahead of Capitol Riot

WASHINGTON (AP) – The FBI warned law enforcement agencies of potential extremist-driven violence ahead of the Capitol riot, but early statements suggested that law enforcement was unprepared for the level of violence that unfolded on Jan. 6.

In a Jan. 5 report, the FBI detailed potential for "war" in Washington, a warning that was shared with law enforcement agencies, including the Capitol Police. However, Capitol Police and other officials have said they were unaware of serious concerns about Jan. 6.

"We had specific intelligence that there were going to be individuals who were going to come armed and that there was going to be violence," said Michael Sherwin, acting U.S. Attorney.

The Justice Department has formed a strike force to investigate the riot, similar to counterterrorism probes. Officials are considering sedition charges against some rioters, which carry possible 20-year prison terms.

"We are looking at seditious conspiracy charges," said Steven D'Antuono, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington field office. "That's a very serious charge."

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for rioters to be placed on a no-fly list.

"We need to make sure that these people are not able to get on a plane and travel around the country," Schumer said.

The riot resulted in at least five deaths, including one Capitol Police officer, and disrupted the peaceful transfer of power.

"This was an attack on our democracy," said Jeffrey Rosen, acting Attorney General. "We will not tolerate this kind of violence."

Unpreparedness and Delayed Response

Early statements suggested that law enforcement was unprepared for the level of violence that occurred on Jan. 6.

Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy reportedly wasn't notified about the FBI warning. Officials also turned down Pentagon help three days before the riot, and response teams were delayed during the assault.

"We were not prepared for the level of violence that we saw," said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We were caught off guard."

The Capitol Police has been criticized for its handling of the riot, with some lawmakers calling for the resignation of its chief, Steven Sund.

"The Capitol Police failed to protect the Capitol," said Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.). "They need to be held accountable."

Ongoing Investigation

The Justice Department's strike force is investigating the riot, and hundreds of people have been arrested. Officials are also looking into the role of social media in the planning and execution of the attack.

"We are committed to holding accountable those who were responsible for this attack," said Sherwin. "We will not rest until justice is served."

The riot has raised serious questions about the security of the Capitol and the ability of law enforcement to respond to future threats.

"We need to learn from this attack and make sure that it never happens again," said Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah). "We need to strengthen our security and ensure that our law enforcement agencies are prepared to respond to any threat."
