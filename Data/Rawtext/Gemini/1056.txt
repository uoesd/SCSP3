Laundrie's Flight to Florida Deepens Mystery in Petito Disappearance

NORTH PORT, Fla. – The investigation into the disappearance of Gabby Petito took a new turn on Monday with the revelation that her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, flew to Florida from Salt Lake City on August 17 and returned six days later during their road trip.

Laundrie's attorney, Steven Bertolino, confirmed the flight details, stating that the purpose was to save money for extending their road trip.

"The Laundries did not know that Brian had returned to Florida," Bertolino said. "They were under the impression that Brian and Gabby were traveling together."

Laundrie returned home on September 1 without Petito, driving her 2012 Ford Transit. He has since been named a "person of interest" in her disappearance.

Petito, who went missing during the trip, was confirmed dead on September 19, her body found in Bridger-Teton National Forest, Wyoming.

Laundrie's sister, Cassie, pleaded for him to surrender to police in an interview with ABC News on Monday.

"I would tell my brother to come forward and get help if you need it, we all worry about you and want you to come home," Cassie said. "I don't know where Brian is."

Cassie's last interaction with Brian was on September 6 during a family visit, which she described as "ordinary."

"He was fine," Cassie said. "He was just, you know, hanging out with the family."

New Moab Police body camera footage released on Monday showed an interaction between police, Petito, and Laundrie on August 12.

In the footage, Petito describes Laundrie grabbing and scratching her face; she acknowledged hitting him first.

The couple was stopped by Moab, Utah police after a witness reported a domestic violence incident.

The footage has intensified the case's attention, with a nationwide manhunt for Brian Laundrie underway.

Background:

Gabby Petito, 22, and Brian Laundrie, 23, were a young couple from North Port, Florida. They had been dating for two years and had recently moved into a van together.

The couple's road trip was documented on social media, with Petito posting frequent updates on Instagram. However, her posts abruptly stopped in late August.

Petito's family became concerned when they lost contact with her in late August. They reported her missing on September 11.

Laundrie initially cooperated with the investigation but later refused to speak to police. He disappeared on September 14 and has not been seen since.

The case has garnered national attention, with many people following the developments on social media. The FBI is assisting in the investigation.
