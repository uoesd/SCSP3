Teen Vaccine Uptake Stalls, Parents Cite Safety Concerns

The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines for children and adolescents has encountered significant challenges, with vaccine uptake lagging behind expectations. A recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) reveals that only about half of parents of 12-17 year-olds report that their teen has been vaccinated, while the vaccination rate among 5-11 year-olds is even lower.

Stalled Teen Vaccine Uptake

The KFF survey indicates that vaccine uptake among teenagers has plateaued, with no significant increase in the past few months. Only 52% of parents of 12-17 year-olds report that their teen has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and only 46% are fully vaccinated. This is significantly lower than the vaccination rates among adults, with 80% of adults fully vaccinated.

Low Uptake Among Younger Children

The vaccination rate among younger children is even lower. Only 16% of parents of children ages 5 to 11 report that their child has been vaccinated, and another 13% plan to do so "right away." This means that the majority of children in this age group remain unvaccinated.

Parental Concerns

The KFF survey highlights several reasons for the low vaccine uptake among children and adolescents. Safety concerns are a major factor, with 30% of parents of teens and 36% of parents of younger children saying they are concerned about the potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines.

Access Barriers

Hispanic, Black, and lower-income parents express more concern over access barriers to vaccinating their children. These parents are more likely to report that they have difficulty finding a vaccination appointment or that they lack transportation to a vaccination site.

Trusted Sources of Information

Pediatricians are the most trusted source of vaccine information for parents, with 72% of parents saying they trust their child's healthcare provider for information about COVID-19 vaccines. However, fewer than half of parents have discussed COVID-19 vaccinations with their child's healthcare provider.

School Involvement

About half of parents say their child's school provided information or encouraged COVID-19 vaccination. Parents who report that their school encouraged COVID-19 vaccination are more likely to have vaccinated children.

Opposition to School Mandates

Despite the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines for children, parents of 5-17 year-olds largely oppose schools requiring COVID-19 vaccines for eligible students. Only 37% of parents support school mandates, while 63% oppose them. This suggests that parents prioritize personal choice over collective responsibility when it comes to vaccinating their children.

Impact of the Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on parents and families. The KFF survey found that the pandemic has affected mental health, financial stability, and children's education, especially among lower-income and minority groups.

Conclusion

The low vaccine uptake among children and adolescents is a major concern, as it leaves them vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and its potential complications. Parents' concerns about safety and access barriers need to be addressed to increase vaccination rates. Pediatricians and schools play a crucial role in providing accurate information and encouraging vaccination. While parents may prioritize personal choice over school mandates, it is essential to emphasize the collective responsibility to protect children and communities from COVID-19.
