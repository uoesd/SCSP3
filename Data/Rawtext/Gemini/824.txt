Stimulus Checks and Financial Relief: What's Next After the Third Round?

The third round of stimulus checks, distributed in March 2021, provided much-needed financial relief to millions of Americans amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, as the economic fallout continues, discussions surrounding a fourth round of stimulus checks or recurring payments have gained significant traction.

Calls for Recurring Payments

One of the most prominent advocates for recurring payments is Stephanie Bonin, who launched a petition on Change.org calling for $2,000 monthly payments to all Americans. The petition has garnered nearly 3 million signatures, reflecting the widespread support for ongoing financial assistance.

Progressive lawmakers have also joined the chorus, petitioning the White House to consider recurring payments or additional stimulus money. They argue that the economic recovery is far from complete and that many Americans continue to struggle financially.

State-Specific Stimulus and Teacher Bonuses

In the absence of federal action, several states have implemented their own stimulus programs. California, for instance, has distributed $600 stimulus checks to eligible residents. Additionally, multiple states have provided bonuses to teachers, recognizing their extraordinary efforts during the pandemic.

Child Tax Credit and Plus-Up Payments

The American Rescue Plan, passed in March 2021, includes the Child Tax Credit, which provides up to $3,600 per child under 6 and $3,000 for children 6-17. Monthly payments will begin on July 15 and continue until December.

Individuals who experienced a drop in income in 2020 compared to 2019 may be eligible for Plus-Up Payments, which could provide additional stimulus money.

Homeowners Assistance Fund and Eviction Ban Extension

The American Rescue Plan also includes the Homeowners Assistance Fund (HAF), which provides assistance with mortgage payments and utility bills. Each state and territory is allocated at least $50 million for this program.

Furthermore, the CDC's national eviction ban has been extended for two more months, offering protection to tenants who are unable to pay rent due to the pandemic. $46.6 billion has been allocated for emergency rental assistance.

American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan

The Biden administration has proposed two major infrastructure and social spending plans: the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. While the American Jobs Plan focuses on rebuilding infrastructure, the American Families Plan includes provisions for paid family leave, universal pre-kindergarten, and affordable childcare.

Conclusion

The possibility of a fourth round of stimulus checks or recurring payments remains uncertain, but the ongoing discussions and state-level initiatives highlight the continued need for financial assistance. The Child Tax Credit, Plus-Up Payments, Homeowners Assistance Fund, and eviction ban extension provide some relief, but many Americans are still struggling. As the pandemic persists, it remains to be seen whether the federal government will take further action to address the economic fallout.
