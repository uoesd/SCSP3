Biden Announces Sweeping Vaccine Mandates for 100 Million Americans

WASHINGTON (AP) – President Joe Biden on Thursday announced sweeping new federal vaccine mandates affecting up to 100 million Americans, a dramatic escalation in the fight against the surging COVID-19 delta variant.

The mandates, which Biden said were necessary to "protect the health and economic security of our nation," apply to private-sector employees, health care workers, federal contractors, and others.

"We've been patient. But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us," Biden said in a televised address from the White House. "So please, do the right thing."

The mandates have sparked immediate backlash from Republican leaders and some union chiefs, who accused Biden of overstepping his authority and violating constitutional rights.

"This is an unprecedented and dangerous action by the Biden administration," said Gov. Henry McMaster (R-S.C.). "We will not stand idly by while the federal government tramples on the rights of our citizens."

Everett Kelley, National President of the American Federation of Government Employees, said the union was "deeply concerned" about the mandates and their potential impact on federal workers.

"We believe that the government should not be mandating vaccines for its employees," Kelley said. "This is a personal decision that should be made by each individual in consultation with their doctor."

Despite the opposition, Biden's efforts to increase vaccination rates have received support from the American Medical Association, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Business Roundtable.

"We believe that these mandates are necessary to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers," said Jay Timmons, CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers. "We urge all businesses to follow the President's lead and implement similar measures."

The new rules require employers with more than 100 workers to mandate vaccines or weekly testing, affecting about 80 million Americans. Employees of the executive branch and contractors with the federal government must be vaccinated, with no testing option, affecting several million more workers.

Biden's address also included efforts to increase virus testing, support for safe school operations, and urging large venues to require vaccinations or negative tests for entry.

The new requirements will be enforced through various federal agencies, with specific penalties and guidelines for non-compliance.

Despite a high vaccination rate, the U.S. is experiencing a significant increase in COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths compared to last year.

"We are in a critical moment in this pandemic," Biden said. "We have the tools to defeat this virus, but we need everyone to do their part."
