FDA and CDC Lift Pause on Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine

Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have lifted the recommended pause on the use of the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. The decision was made after a thorough safety review of the vaccine.

"We have concluded that the known and potential benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks for individuals 18 years of age and older," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. "The FDA has determined that the vaccine is effective in preventing COVID-19 and that the chance of thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) occurring is very low."

The pause was initially recommended on April 13, 2021, after six reports of a rare and severe type of blood clot called TTS were reported following administration of the vaccine. The FDA and CDC conducted a thorough review of the data, assessed the risks, and conducted outreach to healthcare providers during the pause.

"The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has reviewed the latest data on TTS and has recommended that the use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine be resumed," said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky. "The ACIP concluded that the vaccine's benefits outweigh its risks for individuals 18 years of age and older."

The FDA and CDC have revised the fact sheets for the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to include information about the risk of TTS. Healthcare providers and recipients are urged to review the fact sheets before administering or receiving the vaccine.

"Safety is our top priority," said Dr. Woodcock. "We have extensive monitoring systems in place to track the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines, and we will continue to monitor the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine closely."

"The vaccine safety systems in the United States are working," said Dr. Walensky. "We encourage people to consult with their healthcare providers if they have any questions about the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine."

Reported Cases of TTS

As of April 23, 2021, a total of 15 cases of TTS have been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). All of the cases occurred in women aged between 18 and 59 years.

Symptoms of TTS

Symptoms of TTS include:

  • Severe headache
  • Blurred vision
  • Seizures
  • Shortness of breath
  • Chest pain
  • Leg swelling

If you experience any of these symptoms after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, seek medical attention immediately.
