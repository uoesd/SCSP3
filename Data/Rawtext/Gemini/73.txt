Capitol Police's Restraint During Riot Belies Failures Exposed in New Report

Contrary to expectations based on previous protests, the Capitol Police exhibited remarkable restraint during the January 6th riot. However, a new report by Capitol Police Inspector General Michael A. Bolton has revealed severe shortcomings in the force's preparation and response to the attack.

Warnings Ignored, Equipment Deficient

Despite warnings of a potential threat to Congress, Capitol Police leadership dismissed threat assessments and limited officers' riot-prevention equipment. "The Department did not adequately prepare for the January 6th attack," Bolton stated in his report. "There were failures in intelligence, equipment readiness, and operational preparedness."

Former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund resigned, claiming a lack of intelligence predicted the riot's scale. However, Bolton's findings contradict this claim, revealing that warnings from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security about potential violence were ignored or underestimated.

Leadership Criticized

The report criticizes the leadership for not allowing the use of heavier less-lethal weapons and for the lack of standards for equipment. "The Department did not have a clear and consistent policy on the use of less-lethal weapons," Bolton said. "This lack of clarity led to confusion and inconsistency in the use of these weapons on January 6th."

Bolton's findings also highlight issues with police equipment, such as shields that shattered upon impact due to improper storage. "The Department's shields were not properly stored or maintained," Bolton stated. "This resulted in many of the shields being ineffective during the attack."

Need for Reform

The report suggests a need for deep reforms within the Capitol Police department and its culture. "The Department needs to make significant changes to its policies, procedures, and training," Bolton said. "These changes will help to ensure that the Department is better prepared to respond to future threats."

Comparisons to BLM Protests

Discussions and comparisons have arisen regarding the perceived difference in police response to the Capitol riot versus Black Lives Matter protests. Some critics have accused the Capitol Police of using excessive force against BLM protesters while showing restraint during the Capitol riot.

"The Department's response to the January 6th attack was different from its response to other protests," Bolton acknowledged. "However, it is important to note that the circumstances of each protest were different."

Bolton emphasized the need for a thorough review of the Capitol Police's response to both the Capitol riot and BLM protests to identify areas for improvement. "The Department needs to learn from its mistakes and make changes to ensure that it is better prepared to respond to future threats," he said.

Conclusion

The Capitol Police's restraint during the Capitol riot was commendable, but it cannot overshadow the failures exposed by the Inspector General's report. The force's lack of preparation, inadequate equipment, and questionable leadership decisions contributed to the chaos and violence of January 6th. Deep reforms are necessary to ensure that the Capitol Police is better equipped to protect the Capitol and its occupants from future threats.
