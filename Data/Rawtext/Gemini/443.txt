Archbishop Confirms Meghan and Harry's Private Vow Exchange Was Not Legally Binding

CNN – Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has confirmed that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were not legally married before their public ceremony in 2018.

In an interview with the BBC, Welby said that he signed the legal marriage document on the day of their public wedding at St. George's Chapel in Windsor on May 19, 2018.

"The legal wedding was on the Saturday," Welby said. "I signed the marriage certificate, which is a legal document, and I would have committed a serious criminal offense if I signed it knowing it was false."

Markle had previously revealed in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that she and Harry had a private exchange of vows three days before their public ceremony. However, the private ceremony did not have witnesses, leading to speculation that it was not legally binding.

Welby's clarification confirms that the couple's legal marriage took place on the day of their public wedding.

The revelation comes after Harry and Meghan stepped back from royal duties in January 2020. In their bombshell interview with Oprah, they discussed racism within the royal family and Meghan's mental health struggles.

One of the major revelations from the interview was that there were concerns within the royal family about the skin color of their unborn child, Archie.

The interview allowed Harry and Meghan to speak more freely about their experiences in the royal family.

"I think they're a very brave couple," Welby said. "They've been through a lot, and they've come out the other side."

Harry and Meghan have since settled in California with their two children, Archie and Lilibet.
