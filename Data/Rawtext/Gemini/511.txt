Missouri National Guard Deployed to Assist in Hurricane Ida Recovery

Governor Mike Parson of Missouri has activated the Missouri National Guard to support recovery efforts in Louisiana following the devastating impact of Hurricane Ida. Approximately 300 Soldiers will be deployed to provide humanitarian aid, equipment, and debris removal.

"When one state is in need, it's important for other states to step up and help," said Governor Parson. "The Missouri National Guard has a proven track record of assisting in recovery efforts, and we are proud to offer our support to Louisiana during this challenging time."

The deployment is in response to a request from Louisiana through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), a mutual aid agreement among states for sharing resources during emergencies. The Missouri National Guard will provide humanitarian support, equipment, debris removal, and general support.

"Our Soldiers are well-trained and experienced in recovery operations," said Maj. Gen. Levon Cumpton, Missouri National Guard Adjutant General. "We are committed to working alongside our Louisiana counterparts to provide assistance and support to those affected by Hurricane Ida."

Soldiers from the 110th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade and the 35th Engineer Brigade are among those being mobilized. The deployment is set to last up to 14 days, with soldiers ready to assist as long as needed.

This effort reflects the broader spirit of Americans helping Americans in times of crisis. The Missouri National Guard's deployment is a testament to the importance of states working together to support each other during natural disasters.
