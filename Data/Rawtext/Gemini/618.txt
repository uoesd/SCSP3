Vice President Harris Welcomes President Akufo-Addo to the White House, Underscoring Strong U.S.-Ghana Ties

Today, it is my distinct honor to welcome His Excellency Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, President of the Republic of Ghana, to the White House. President Akufo-Addo, your presence here is a testament to the enduring friendship and cooperation between our two nations.

The United States and Ghana have enjoyed a strong bilateral relationship since Ghana's independence in 1957. Our ties, however, extend far beyond that date, rooted in shared values and a common history. Many Americans trace their ancestry to Ghana, and they travel there to connect with their heritage and learn about the transatlantic slave trade. These cultural connections serve as a powerful reminder of our intertwined past and present.

At the heart of our relationship lies a shared commitment to democracy. Ghana has consistently demonstrated its dedication to free and fair elections, setting an example for other nations in the region. We recognize that democracies are strengthened when all citizens have a voice and weakened when individuals are excluded. Our partnership is founded on this fundamental principle.

Our collaboration extends to the realm of global health. Together, we are working to combat COVID-19 and prepare for future pandemics. The United States, as a member of COVAX and the African Union, has donated over 1.2 million doses of the Moderna vaccine to Ghana and plans to send more than 1.3 million Pfizer vaccine doses. This assistance reflects our shared belief that health security is a global responsibility.

We are also committed to expanding our economic relationship. American companies are increasingly investing in Ghana, recognizing the country's favorable business environment and skilled workforce. The Ghanaian government has created a confidence-inspiring environment through its respect for the rule of law and human rights. We commend these efforts and look forward to continued economic cooperation.

As members of the United Nations Security Council, the United States and Ghana share a responsibility to promote peace and security around the world. We have worked together on issues such as climate change, counterterrorism, and peacekeeping. We look forward to continuing this collaboration and leveraging our combined influence to address global challenges.

President Akufo-Addo, your leadership has been instrumental in strengthening the bonds between our two nations. Your commitment to democracy, human rights, and economic development has earned you the respect of the Ghanaian people and the international community.

On behalf of the United States, I extend our heartfelt gratitude for your partnership. We are confident that the future holds even greater opportunities for cooperation between our two countries. Together, we will continue to build a more just, prosperous, and secure world for all.
