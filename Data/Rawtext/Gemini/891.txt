Broncos Fans Face Super Bowl Dilemma: Chiefs or Brady?

For Broncos fans, Super Bowl LV presents an agonizing dilemma: root for their AFC West archrivals, the Kansas City Chiefs, or endure the prospect of their longtime nemesis, Tom Brady, hoisting another Lombardi Trophy.

The arrival of Brady in Tampa Bay has amplified Broncos fans' disdain. The six-time Super Bowl champion, who tormented the Broncos during his tenure with the New England Patriots, now stands as the face of their NFC South rivals.

A recent Twitter poll conducted by Broncos beat writer Aric DiLalla revealed that approximately a third of Broncos fans refuse to root for either the Chiefs or Brady in the Super Bowl.

"I can't root for the Chiefs," said Julie Thuis, a diehard Broncos fan from Denver. "They're our rivals. I can't root for Brady either. He's the devil."

Christine Voss, another devoted Broncos fan, echoed Thuis's sentiments. "I'd rather root for Tampa Bay over the Chiefs," she said. "Divisional rivalry trumps personal dislike."

The Chiefs, led by the dynamic Patrick Mahomes, pose a significant threat to the Broncos' historical dominance in the AFC West. Mahomes has already won a Super Bowl and an MVP award, and his Chiefs have reached the AFC Championship Game in each of the past three seasons.

"Mahomes is a generational talent," said Dave DeNovellis, a Broncos fan from Boulder. "If he keeps playing like this, he'll surpass John Elway as the greatest quarterback in Broncos history."

Some Broncos fans harbor a deep resentment towards Brady, labeling him as the NFL's "Voldemort" and criticizing his attempt to trademark "Tompa Bay."

"Brady is the worst," said DeNovellis. "He's a cheater and a sore loser. I hope he loses every game for the rest of his career."

Former State Rep. Cole Wist, a lifelong Broncos fan, expressed his difficulty in choosing a side. "I'm torn," he said. "I hate the Chiefs, but I also hate Brady. I might just root for the commercials."

Others have suggested considering team connections to Colorado or rooting for the underdog as potential criteria for choosing whom to support. The Chiefs have several former Broncos players on their roster, including wide receiver Demarcus Robinson and defensive lineman Mike Pennel. The Buccaneers, on the other hand, have former Colorado Buffaloes star Laviska Shenault Jr.

"I'm going to root for the underdog," said Wist. "That's the Chiefs. I don't like it, but I'm going to do it."

The predicament faced by Broncos fans has led some to question the existence of God.

"If there is a God," said DeNovellis, "why would he make us choose between these two evils?"

In the end, the decision of whom to root for in Super Bowl LV is a personal one for Broncos fans. There is no right or wrong answer, only the agonizing choice between two unpalatable options.
