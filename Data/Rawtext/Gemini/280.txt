Biden Unveils Comprehensive COVID-19 Strategy, Aiming for 100 Million Vaccinations in 100 Days

Washington, D.C. - President Biden today announced a comprehensive strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including a significant increase in vaccine supply and funding. The plan aims to administer 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days and provide states, Tribes, and territories with the resources they need to protect their communities.

"We are at a critical moment in the fight against this pandemic," said President Biden. "This strategy will accelerate our vaccination efforts, provide much-needed relief to states and Tribes, and help us turn the corner on this crisis."

Increased Vaccine Supply

The Biden Administration is working with vaccine manufacturers to increase the supply of vaccines available to states, Tribes, and territories. This week, states will see a 5 percent increase in vaccine supply, and by the end of the month, the supply will increase by 22 percent compared to January 20. The Administration has committed to maintaining this increased supply for at least the next three weeks.

Federal Retail Pharmacy Program

The Administration is also launching the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination on February 11. This program will make vaccines available through select pharmacies across the country. In the initial phase, priority groups will receive vaccinations at no cost, with limited supply.

FEMA Reimbursements

President Biden has directed FEMA to fully reimburse states for COVID-related National Guard personnel and emergency costs retroactively from the beginning of the pandemic. The Administration estimates that these retroactive reimbursements will total $3-5 billion.

American Rescue Plan

The Administration is requesting $350 billion from Congress in the American Rescue Plan to support the COVID-19 response. This funding will be used to increase vaccine supply, expand testing and tracing, provide economic relief to individuals and businesses, and support state and local governments.

Other Key Provisions

In addition to the key provisions outlined above, the President's strategy includes:

  • Expanding access to testing and tracing
  • Providing economic relief to individuals and businesses
  • Supporting state and local governments
  • Addressing health disparities
  • Strengthening global cooperation

The Biden Administration is committed to working with states, Tribes, territories, and the private sector to implement this strategy and defeat the COVID-19 pandemic.
