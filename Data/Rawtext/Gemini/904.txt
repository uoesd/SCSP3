Bucs Season Ticket Prices to Soar After Super Bowl Triumph

TAMPA – Tampa Bay Buccaneers season pass holders will face ticket price increases ranging from 10 to 45 percent for the 2021 season, the team announced on Tuesday.

The increase comes after a surge in demand for tickets following the signing of quarterback Tom Brady in 2020. The Bucs went on to win the Super Bowl in February, their first since 2003.

"We are incredibly grateful for the support of our fans," said Bucs Chief Operating Officer Brian Ford. "These price adjustments reflect the increased demand for tickets and our commitment to providing a first-class experience for our fans."

The highest increase, 45 percent, will be for seats in the 300 level, which were previously offered at half price to youths. The Bucs are eliminating 3,000 seats in that section.

Ford said the price increases are also necessary to cover the cost of over $150 million in stadium renovations and to align with league pricing models.

"We believe that our ticket prices are still very affordable," Ford said. "We offer one of the lowest average ticket prices in the NFL."

The Bucs averaged 15,600 fans per game in the 2020 season, which was limited by pandemic restrictions. The team is hoping to fill the 65,000-seat Raymond James Stadium for the 2021 season.

"We are excited to welcome our fans back to Raymond James Stadium," said Bucs Coach Bruce Arians. "We know that winning a Super Bowl during a pandemic was a daunting task, but we did it together. We can't wait to see our fans back in the stands."

General Manager Jason Licht echoed Arians' sentiments.

"Our fans are the best in the NFL," Licht said. "We are grateful for their support, and we are committed to providing them with a winning team and a great experience at Raymond James Stadium."

The secondary market for Bucs tickets is expected to see even higher price increases in the wake of the team's Super Bowl victory.

"We expect to see a lot of demand for Bucs tickets on the secondary market," said Joe Pompliano, a sports economist at the University of North Carolina. "The Bucs are one of the most popular teams in the NFL, and they have a lot of momentum after winning the Super Bowl."

Pompliano said that fans who are unable to purchase season tickets may still be able to find affordable tickets on the secondary market.

"There are a lot of factors that affect ticket prices on the secondary market," Pompliano said. "The day of the week, the opponent, and the weather can all impact prices."

Fans who are interested in purchasing season tickets can do so by visiting the Bucs website or calling the team's ticket office.
