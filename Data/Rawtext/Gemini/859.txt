Black Box Data to Shed Light on Tiger Woods' Accident

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is set to analyze data from the black box of Tiger Woods' car following his single-vehicle accident last week.

"We will be examining the black box," Sheriff Alex Villanueva announced during a Facebook Live session. "That will give us a lot of information about the speed, the braking, the acceleration, and all those factors that go into determining what happened."

The data analysis aims to uncover the circumstances at the time of the accident to help determine its cause.

"This is part of our standard operating procedure," said Deputy John Schloegl. "We investigate all traffic collisions to determine if a crime was committed."

Woods' accident in Rancho Palos Verdes involved his car hitting a sign and a tree before sustaining major damage. He underwent emergency surgery for significant injuries to his right lower extremity.

Sheriff Villanueva stated during a press briefing that Woods would not face criminal charges, deeming the incident an accident.

"There's no evidence of impairment," Villanueva said. "We don't contemplate any charges whatsoever in this case."

There's also no consideration of misdemeanor charges like reckless driving unless evidence supports such an infraction.

"We're not looking at any reckless driving charges at this point," Schloegl said.

Woods was not tested for impairment at the scene due to the absence of evident impairments.

"He was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs," said Anish Mahajan, Chief Medical Officer at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where Woods was treated.

The black box data is expected to provide valuable insights into the circumstances leading up to the accident.

"This will give us a better understanding of what happened," Villanueva said. "We're going to take our time and do a thorough investigation."

The investigation is ongoing, and the Sheriff's Department is asking anyone with information about the accident to contact them.
