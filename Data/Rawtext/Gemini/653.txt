Rittenhouse Verdict: Democrats Erupt in Outrage, Accusing Jury of White Supremacy

In a stunning verdict that has sent shockwaves across the nation, Kyle Rittenhouse has been acquitted of all charges related to the August 2020 shootings of three men in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The jury's decision has ignited a firestorm of outrage among Democrats and activists, who have swiftly condemned the outcome as a miscarriage of justice rooted in white supremacy.

Outpouring of Condemnation from Democratic Leaders

Leading the charge of condemnation was Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), who took to Twitter to express her disbelief and anger. "This verdict is a disgrace," she wrote. "It's a clear message that white supremacy is alive and well in our justice system. Kyle Rittenhouse should be in jail for murder, not walking free."

Echoing Bush's sentiments, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio repeated the incorrect claim that Rittenhouse crossed state lines with a weapon. "This verdict is a travesty of justice," de Blasio tweeted. "Kyle Rittenhouse is a white supremacist who traveled across state lines to murder protesters. He should be behind bars, not a free man."

Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, also criticized the verdict, calling it "a dangerous and unjust outcome." Nadler stated that the jury's decision "sends a chilling message that it is acceptable to use violence against those who are protesting for racial justice."

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) joined the chorus of condemnation, tweeting, "This verdict is a stain on our justice system. Kyle Rittenhouse is a murderer who got away with killing two people. This is a victory for white supremacy and a defeat for justice."

Biden Expresses Respect for Jury System

In contrast to the outrage expressed by Democrats, President Joe Biden took a more measured approach, expressing his respect for the jury system and its conclusion. "I stand by the jury's verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse case," Biden said in a statement. "I urge everyone to respect the outcome of this case and to refrain from violence."

Hollywood and Activists Join the Fray

Celebrities in Hollywood and activists also expressed dismay and criticized the judicial system following the verdict. Actor Mark Ruffalo tweeted, "This verdict is a disgrace. Kyle Rittenhouse is a murderer who should be in prison. This is a victory for white supremacy and a defeat for justice."

Activist Shaun King echoed Ruffalo's sentiments, stating, "This verdict is a clear message that white people can kill Black people with impunity. This is a victory for white supremacy and a defeat for justice."

Criticism of Judge and Jury

Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder and the jury faced criticism from various public figures. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) called for Schroeder to be impeached, while Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) accused the jury of being "complicit in white supremacy."

ACLU Blames Police for Enabling White Supremacists

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) also weighed in on the verdict, criticizing police for enabling white supremacist militia members. "The police in Kenosha failed to protect protesters from white supremacist militia members," the ACLU stated in a press release. "This failure created a dangerous environment that led to the deaths of two people."

Prosecution Did Not Label Rittenhouse as 'White Supremacist'

It is important to note that the prosecution did not label Rittenhouse as a 'white supremacist' in their closing arguments. Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger stated that the prosecution "did not try this case as a hate crime" and that they "did not try this case as a political case."

Rittenhouse Spokesman Criticizes Biden

David Hancock, a spokesperson for Kyle Rittenhouse, criticized President Biden for previously calling Rittenhouse a 'white supremacist.' "President Biden should apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse for calling him a 'white supremacist,'" Hancock said. "Kyle Rittenhouse is not a white supremacist, and he should not be labeled as such."
