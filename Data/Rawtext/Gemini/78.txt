Justice Dept. Refuses to Defend Brooks, Casting Doubt on Trump's Defense

WASHINGTON, July 29 – The U.S. Justice Department has declined to defend Rep. Morris "Mo" Brooks (R-Ala.) in a lawsuit accusing him of inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, a move that could have significant implications for former President Donald Trump's defense in similar lawsuits.

The department's decision, announced in a court filing on Thursday, implies that inciting an attack on Congress is beyond the scope of employment for federal employees, including Representatives.

"The Department of Justice has determined that the allegations in the complaint do not fall within the scope of Mr. Brooks' employment as a Member of Congress," the filing stated.

Legal experts view the decision as a message to Trump, suggesting that he will not get immunity under the Westfall Act for actions related to the Capitol riot. The Westfall Act provides immunity to federal employees for actions taken within the scope of their employment.

"This is a very significant development," said Donald Ayer, a former senior Justice Department official. "It suggests that the Justice Department is not going to give Trump a pass on his actions related to January 6th."

Trump and Brooks are co-defendants in a lawsuit filed by Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who alleges that they incited the Capitol attack to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's election victory.

Trump is also facing two other lawsuits related to his actions on and before Jan. 6. One lawsuit, filed by the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack, alleges that Trump conspired to overturn the election results. The other lawsuit, filed by the NAACP, alleges that Trump violated the Ku Klux Klan Act by inciting the Capitol attack.

Trump has not yet sought Justice Department protection, and his primary defense does not rely on the Westfall Act but on presidential immunity. However, the Justice Department's recent actions have caused concern among some Democrats, who believe the department is protecting Trump personally rather than the office of the presidency.

"The Justice Department's refusal to defend Brooks is troubling," said Anne Tindall, an attorney with Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan watchdog group. "It suggests that the department is more interested in protecting Trump than in holding him accountable for his actions."

However, other legal experts believe that the Justice Department's actions are simply a reflection of the law.

"The Westfall Act does not provide immunity for actions that are outside the scope of an employee's employment," said Jesse Binnall, an attorney for Trump. "The Justice Department's decision is simply a recognition of that fact."

The refusal to defend Brooks may indicate a tougher stance against Trump, with legal experts suggesting that it is bad news for him.

"This is a significant setback for Trump's defense," said Ayer. "It shows that the Justice Department is not going to give him a free pass."

Brooks' attempt to use the Westfall Act for immunity was rejected, indicating that Trump might face similar challenges.

"The Westfall Act is not a get-out-of-jail-free card," said Tindall. "Trump will have to prove that his actions on January 6th were within the scope of his employment as president."

Legal experts believe that Trump's case is weaker than Brooks', as Trump had no official role in the election certification process.

"Trump was not acting within the scope of his employment when he incited the Capitol attack," said Binnall. "He was acting as a private citizen, and he should be held accountable for his actions."

The Justice Department's decision not to defend Brooks is a significant development in the legal battle over the Capitol attack. It suggests that Trump will not get immunity under the Westfall Act and that he may face criminal charges.
