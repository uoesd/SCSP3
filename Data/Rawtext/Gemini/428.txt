Biden Hails Chauvin Verdict as Step Forward, Urges Policing Reform

WASHINGTON (AP) – President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hailed the conviction of Derek Chauvin in George Floyd's killing as a step forward in the fight against systemic racism, but emphasized that the battle for justice and policing reform is far from over.

"This can be a moment of significant change," Biden said in an address to the nation Tuesday evening. "But it is not the moment to turn away or rest. We have to listen. We have to hear. We have to act."

Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was convicted of two counts of murder and one of manslaughter after the jury deliberated for about 10 hours over two days. The verdict came after weeks of emotional testimony and protests across the country.

Biden had earlier expressed hope for "the right verdict" while the jury was sequestered, a comment that drew attention. The White House later clarified that Biden was not trying to influence the jury but was simply expressing his hope for justice.

The verdict's aftermath presents a challenge for Biden, who aims to address policing racism while maintaining support for law enforcement.

"We can't let this moment pass us by," Biden said. "We have to seize it as an opportunity to make real change."

Biden and Harris urged Congress to pass the George Floyd policing reform bill, which would ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants, create a national registry of police misconduct, and make it easier to prosecute officers for misconduct.

"We need to pass meaningful police reform," Harris said. "We need to hold law enforcement accountable."

Harris, the first Black woman vice president, spoke on racism's impact on the country's potential and promise of justice for all.

"For too long, we have allowed systemic racism to infect our laws, our institutions, and our hearts," Harris said. "We must confront it head-on."

Biden and Harris highlighted the need to confront hatred and systemic racism beyond legal reforms.

"We need to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system," Biden said. "We need to address the systemic racism that plagues our society."

Biden interacted with Floyd's family, offering comfort and seeing Floyd's death as a world-changing event.

"I know nothing can bring George back," Biden said. "But I hope this verdict brings some peace to his family."

Floyd's family expressed relief and gratitude for the verdict.

"Today, we are able to breathe again," said Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother.

Responses to the verdict included relief and a renewed push for policing reform legislation among lawmakers from both parties.

"This verdict is a step in the right direction," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. "But it is only a step."

"We must continue to work to dismantle systemic racism in our criminal justice system," said Senator Tim Scott.

"This verdict is a victory for justice," said Representative Hank Johnson. "But it is not the end of the fight."

Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over the trial, praised the jury for their service.

"You have done your civic duty," Cahill said.

Brock Hunter, a criminal defense attorney and past president of the Minnesota Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said the verdict was a "just outcome."

"The jury got it right," Hunter said. "This is a victory for justice."

The verdict is a significant moment in the fight against systemic racism, but it is only a step forward. The work to create a more just and equitable society continues.
