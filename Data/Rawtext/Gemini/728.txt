Reading Schools Closed After Credible Threat of Violence

READING, Ohio (WXIX) – Reading Community City Schools were closed on Thursday, September 15, 2023, due to a potential threat of violence from a student.

A 13-year-old student was arrested and charged with inducing panic following a school shooting threat. The threat was spread through a Snapchat message warning students not to come to school.

Reading police deemed the threat credible and arrested the student involved. The student was detained at the Hamilton County Juvenile Court Youth Center following arraignment.

"The safety of our students and staff is our top priority," said District Superintendent Jason Enix. "We take all threats seriously and will investigate thoroughly."

Judge Melissa Powers ordered the student to be held until the next court hearing. The prosecution argued that the student, who is part of the National Honor Society, should be held due to the seriousness of the threat.

"This is not a prank," said Powers. "This is a serious matter that could have had tragic consequences."

Superintendent Enix notified parents of the situation and called for vigilance.

"We ask that parents talk to their children about the importance of reporting any threats or suspicious activity to school officials or law enforcement," said Enix.

Classes are set to resume on Friday with additional police presence.

"We want to assure parents and students that we are taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety of our schools," said Enix.

The incident is part of a wider pattern of threats against Tri-State school districts. In recent weeks, there have been similar threats in Cincinnati, Dayton, and Covington.

"It's very concerning that we're seeing this increase in threats against schools," said Enix. "We need to work together as a community to address this issue and keep our children safe."
