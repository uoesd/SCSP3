Harris Addresses UN on Pandemic Preparedness

WASHINGTON – Vice President Kamala Harris will virtually address United Nations members on Thursday, urging global leaders to begin developing pandemic response plans.

Harris' speech, her second to a U.N. body since her inauguration, comes as the U.S. makes progress in vaccinating its population while other countries face vaccine shortages.

"We must start preparing now for the next pandemic," Harris said in a statement. "We cannot afford to wait until the next crisis hits."

The address is co-hosted by the U.N. permanent representatives of Argentina, Japan, Norway, and South Africa.

Harris' speech will outline key focus areas, including improving health system accessibility, investing in science and health workers, and increasing manufacturing capacity for protective equipment and vaccines.

"We must learn from the lessons of the past year," Harris said. "We must be more innovative, more coordinated, and more prepared."

U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield will also speak, urging the creation of a future pandemic preparedness architecture.

"The world barely withstood this pandemic," Thomas-Greenfield said. "We must be ready for the next one."

The Biden administration is nearing its first 100 days, with President Joe Biden set to highlight pandemic response accomplishments in a forthcoming Congress address.

Harris' speech reflects the administration's commitment to global health and pandemic preparedness.

"We are all in this together," Harris said. "We must work together to build a more resilient and equitable world."

Thomas-Greenfield emphasized the importance of international cooperation.

"We cannot do this alone," she said. "We need to work together as a global community."

The speech comes amid ongoing discussions about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for accountability.

Harris is expected to address these issues, calling for transparency and cooperation in investigating the pandemic's origins.

"We must hold ourselves accountable," Harris said. "We must learn from our mistakes and do better next time."
