Tornado Touches Down on Cape Cod as Ida's Remnants Batter New England

Dennis, MA - A confirmed tornado touched down on Cape Cod early Thursday morning as the remnants of Hurricane Ida swept through New England, bringing torrential rain, flooding, and power outages.

The National Weather Service (NWS) confirmed the tornado, classified as an EF-0 with maximum winds near 75 mph, touched down in Dennis, Massachusetts, around 1:15 a.m. The tornado caused damage to trees and structures in the area.

Six tornado warnings were issued for the Cape and Islands during the storm, with warnings ending around 2:30 a.m.

The storm brought heavy rainfall to the region, with over 9 inches reported in parts of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. The rainfall led to significant flooding, including three to four feet of water on Storrow Drive in Boston and multiple vehicles stuck in floodwaters.

The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) warned against driving or walking through flowing water, as even shallow water can carry away vehicles and pedestrians.

The storm also affected transportation services, with the MBTA and Amtrak canceling or suspending services due to flooding. Flash flood warnings covered most of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and severe weather was expected to continue throughout the day.

In New York City, the storm caused historic flooding, with a record 3.15 inches of rain falling in Central Park in one hour. The flooding overwhelmed the city's subway system, causing widespread disruptions.

Over 30,000 people were without power across southern New England during the storm, with utilities working to restore service as quickly as possible.

The NWS urged residents to remain weather aware and to follow the instructions of local officials. The storm is expected to continue to move through the region, bringing additional rainfall and potential flooding.
