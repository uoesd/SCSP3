Missing Long Island Woman's Stepfather Joins Search in Wyoming

Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old woman from Long Island, New York, has been reported missing after her family lost contact with her in late August. Her stepfather, James Schmidt, a former fire chief, has traveled to Wyoming to assist in the search efforts.

Petito was last known to be in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, on August 25th. She had been traveling with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, in a converted van on a cross-country tour of national parks.

"We're just hoping for a miracle at this point," said James Schmidt. "We're just trying to stay positive and hope for the best."

Petito's mother, Nicole Schmidt, said her daughter had been sending regular updates on her travels but stopped communicating around August 25th.

"We're just desperate to find her," said Nicole Schmidt. "We don't know what happened to her. We just want her home safe."

Laundrie has returned to Florida without Petito and has refused to cooperate with authorities. Police in North Port, Florida, have expressed interest in talking to Laundrie but have not accused him of any wrongdoing.

Petito's family has urged Laundrie to provide any information on her whereabouts.

"We just want to know where Gabby is," said James Schmidt. "We're not accusing anyone of anything, but we just want to find our daughter."

Petito's biological father, Joseph Petito, has urged the public to look out for anything "fishy" as the van life nature of their trip means they could be anywhere in the country.

"We're just asking for the public's help," said Joseph Petito. "If you see anything suspicious, please report it to the authorities."

Both the Schmidt and Petito families are appealing for help in locating Gabby. They have set up a GoFundMe page to raise funds for the search efforts and have created a Facebook group called "Find Gabby" to share information and updates.

"We're not going to give up hope," said James Schmidt. "We're going to keep searching until we find Gabby."

Anyone with information on Petito's whereabouts is urged to contact the North Port Police Department at (941) 429-7300.
