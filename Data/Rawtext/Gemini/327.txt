Mega-Ship EVER ACE Triumphantly Navigates Suez Canal

The world's largest container ship, EVER ACE, has successfully traversed the Suez Canal on its maiden voyage, marking a significant milestone in maritime history. Built by Samsung Heavy Industries for Evergreen Marine Corporation, EVER ACE is the first of a series of 12 colossal container ships commissioned by Evergreen.

With a staggering carrying capacity of 23,992 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), EVER ACE eclipses the previous record-holder, HMM Algeciras. Its colossal dimensions include a length of 400 meters, a width of 61.53 meters, and an approximate weight of 235,000 tons. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) meticulously guided the ship's passage, ensuring its safe navigation through the vital waterway.

EVER ACE's successful transit underscores the Suez Canal's capability to accommodate the largest container ships in operation. The ship commenced its maiden voyage from the Port of Taipei, Taiwan, and is destined for Rotterdam, Netherlands, where it is anticipated to arrive on September 4.

Evergreen Marine Corporation, the owner of EVER ACE, also operates the infamous Ever Given, which famously blocked the Suez Canal in March 2021, causing widespread global trade disruptions. The successful passage of EVER ACE demonstrates the company's commitment to efficient and reliable maritime transportation.

The arrival of EVER ACE represents a significant advancement in the shipping industry, enabling the transport of vast quantities of goods with greater efficiency and reduced environmental impact. Its maiden voyage through the Suez Canal further highlights the strategic importance of the waterway for global trade and commerce.
