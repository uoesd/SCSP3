Chauvin Pleads Not Guilty to Federal Charges in Separate Case

CNN – Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to federal charges related to using unreasonable force on a 14-year-old boy in 2017.

Chauvin entered his plea via video conference from the Minnesota maximum-security prison where he is serving a 22 1/2-year sentence for Floyd's murder.

The federal charges are separate from Chauvin's conviction in state court for Floyd's death. A federal grand jury indicted Chauvin and three other former Minneapolis police officers in May, accusing them of violating Floyd's constitutional rights.

The indictment involving the 14-year-old accuses Chauvin of striking the teenager with a flashlight and kneeling on his neck and back. Chauvin is charged with depriving both the teenager and Floyd of their constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable force by a police officer.

Floyd's death in May 2020 sparked widespread protests against police brutality and racial injustice. The video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes ignited outrage and led to calls for police reform.

Chauvin and the three other ex-officers also pleaded not guilty to federal civil rights charges stemming from Floyd's death. The indictment accuses the officers of failing to intervene in Chauvin's use of force and failing to give Floyd medical aid.

The federal trial for Chauvin and the other officers in Floyd's death is scheduled to begin in January 2023.

In addition to the federal charges, Chauvin and the other three officers face separate state charges for aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Those charges are still pending.

Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, said after Wednesday's hearing that his client maintains his innocence in both the federal and state cases.

"Mr. Chauvin believes that he acted with the force that was necessary in both of these incidents," Nelson said.

The prosecution, however, argued that Chauvin's use of force was excessive and unreasonable in both cases.

"The evidence will show that Mr. Chauvin used excessive and unreasonable force against both the 14-year-old boy and George Floyd," said Assistant U.S. Attorney Manda Sertich.

The trial for Chauvin and the other officers in the federal case is expected to last several weeks. If convicted, they could face life in prison.

The outcome of the federal trial could have a significant impact on the ongoing state case against Chauvin and the other officers. If they are convicted in federal court, it could strengthen the prosecution's case in state court.

The federal charges against Chauvin and the other officers are part of a broader effort by the Biden administration to address police misconduct and racial injustice. The Justice Department has launched a number of investigations into police departments across the country, and has pledged to hold officers accountable for excessive use of force.

The federal charges against Chauvin are a reminder that police officers who violate the constitutional rights of citizens will be held accountable, regardless of their rank or position. The trial is expected to be closely watched by civil rights advocates and law enforcement officials alike.
