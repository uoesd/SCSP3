Woods' Sunday Red Inspires Golfers' Support

Tiger Woods' recent car accident in Los Angeles has sent shockwaves through the golf world, prompting an outpouring of support from fellow golfers. In a heartwarming gesture, players at various tournaments donned Woods' signature Sunday-red shirt and black pants as a show of solidarity.

Rory McIlroy, Jason Day, Justin Thomas, Tony Finau, and others participated in the tribute. "It was just a small gesture to let him know that we're thinking of him and rooting for him," said McIlroy.

Tony Finau emphasized the significance of showing support to Woods, who has been a role model for many golfers. "He's the reason why we all wear red on Sundays," Finau said. "It was important for us to show him that we're here for him."

Sebastian Munoz, who grew up idolizing Woods, paid tribute to his influence on his golf career. "He's the reason I started playing golf," Munoz said. "I wouldn't be here without him."

Jason Day aimed to pay respects and wish Woods a quick recovery. "We all know what he's going through, and we just want to let him know that we're here for him," Day said.

Justin Thomas saw the gesture as an opportunity to show support on a significant day for Woods. "It's his birthday, so we thought it would be a nice way to show him that we're thinking of him," Thomas said.

In addition to the clothing tribute, some players also displayed accessories with Woods' initials or logo. Billy Horschel wore a hat with "TW" etched on it, while Matt Kuchar, Jason Day, and Bryson DeChambeau used golf balls stamped with "TIGER."

The gesture of support has been widely praised by fans and commentators alike, highlighting the camaraderie and respect within the golf community. As Woods continues his recovery, the outpouring of support from his fellow golfers serves as a reminder of his enduring legacy and the impact he has had on the sport.
