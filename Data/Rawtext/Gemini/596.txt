Harris Visits Columbus to Promote Infrastructure Law, Address Policy Priorities

Columbus, Ohio - Vice President Kamala Harris visited Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday to promote the recently signed $1.2 trillion infrastructure law, highlighting its potential to create jobs, improve infrastructure, and expand access to broadband internet.

"This is a once-in-a-generation investment in our nation's infrastructure," Harris said during a speech at Columbus State Community College. "It's going to create good-paying jobs, make our communities safer, and help us compete in the global economy."

The infrastructure law, which was signed by President Joe Biden in November, allocates billions of dollars for a wide range of projects, including apprenticeships, road and bridge repairs, and broadband expansion. Ohio is set to receive $9.2 billion for highway programs and $483 million for bridge repairs over the next five years. An additional $100 million is allocated for expanding broadband, with substantial funds also earmarked for airports, public transportation, and water projects.

"This law is going to make a real difference in the lives of Ohioans," Harris said. "It's going to create jobs, improve our infrastructure, and expand access to broadband internet."

The visit to Columbus came on the heels of the passage of a $2 trillion spending bill for social services and climate initiatives, which Harris also supported. Harris briefly served as acting president while Biden underwent a colonoscopy on Friday.

During her speech, Harris also addressed the recent not guilty verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, expressing disappointment and emphasizing the need for criminal justice reform.

"We must continue to fight for a justice system that is fair and just for all," Harris said.

Ohio Republicans criticized Harris' visit, arguing that it was a distraction from other issues, notably the border crisis.

"Vice President Harris' visit to Columbus is nothing more than a political stunt," said Bob Paduchik, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. "She's here to talk about infrastructure, but she's ignoring the real problems facing our country, like the border crisis and the rising cost of living."

Harris countered that the spending plan would lower living costs by investing in infrastructure and addressing supply chain issues.

"We're going to make it easier for businesses to get their goods to market, and we're going to make it easier for families to afford the things they need," Harris said.

Her visit highlighted key Biden administration priorities amid ongoing policy debates. The infrastructure law is a major legislative victory for the administration, and Harris' visit was aimed at promoting its benefits and addressing other policy priorities, such as criminal justice reform and economic recovery.
