'Rust' Armorer Mentored by Gun Expert Who Supplied Fatal Firearm

In the wake of the tragic shooting on the set of the Western film "Rust," new details have emerged about the role of armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and her mentor, gun expert Seth Kenney.

Kenney, who owns a weapon and prop rental company, was hired as an "armorer mentor" for Gutierrez-Reed, a 24-year-old who had limited experience in handling firearms. Kenney supplied the firearms and most of the ammunition for the "Rust" set, including the Colt .45 used by Alec Baldwin when cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was accidentally shot and killed.

According to Jason Bowles, Gutierrez-Reed's attorney, she was "extremely safety conscious" and did not expect live rounds to be present on set. Gutierrez-Reed claims to have checked the rounds to ensure they were "dummies" and locked up the guns, including on the day of the shooting.

However, Santa Fe County Sheriff's spokesperson Juan Ríos could not confirm the Los Angeles Times's reporting that Kenney had supplied the live round that killed Hutchins. "We have not been able to confirm that," Ríos said.

No live ammunition was supposedly kept on the "Rust" set, according to Gutierrez-Reed. However, Sheriff Adan Mendoza stated that finding a live round on set contradicts Gutierrez-Reed's claim.

"We're going to determine how that live round got on the set," Mendoza said. "We're going to find out who put that live round on the set."

Filming on "Rust" has been halted, and an investigation into the incident is ongoing. No charges have been filed yet.

Kenney's Role in the Tragedy

Kenney's role in the "Rust" tragedy is being scrutinized. He recommended Gutierrez-Reed for the armorer job and supplied the Colt .45 used in the shooting.

Kenney has not commented publicly on the incident. However, his company, PDQ Arm & Prop, has released a statement expressing condolences to Hutchins's family and vowing to cooperate with the investigation.

"We are deeply saddened by the tragic accident that occurred on the set of 'Rust,'" the statement said. "We are cooperating fully with the investigation and will continue to do so until its conclusion."

Gutierrez-Reed's Defense

Gutierrez-Reed's attorney, Jason Bowles, has defended her actions, saying she was "extremely safety conscious" and did not expect live rounds to be present on set.

"Hannah was incredibly safety conscious and took her job very seriously," Bowles said. "She did not expect live rounds to be present on set, and she would never have knowingly put anyone in danger."

Bowles said Gutierrez-Reed checked the rounds to ensure they were "dummies" and locked up the guns, including on the day of the shooting.

"Hannah checked the rounds that were loaded into the gun and ensured that they were dummy rounds," Bowles said. "She also locked up the guns in a safe location at the end of each day."

Investigation Ongoing

The investigation into the "Rust" shooting is ongoing, and it is unclear when charges will be filed.

Sheriff Mendoza said the investigation is "complex" and "will take some time."

"We're going to be thorough and we're going to be accurate," Mendoza said. "We're going to find out what happened and we're going to hold those responsible accountable."

Industry Safety Concerns

The "Rust" tragedy has raised concerns about safety on film sets. Some industry experts have called for stricter regulations on the use of firearms on sets.

"This is a wake-up call for the industry," said one industry expert. "We need to take a hard look at our safety protocols and make sure that we're doing everything we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening again."

Hutchins's Legacy

Halyna Hutchins was a rising star in the film industry. She was known for her work on films such as "Archenemy" and "The Mad Hatter."

Hutchins's death has been a devastating loss for the film industry and for her family. Her husband, Matthew Hutchins, said he is "heartbroken" by her death.

"Halyna was a kind and loving person," Matthew Hutchins said. "She was also a brilliant cinematographer. She will be deeply missed."
