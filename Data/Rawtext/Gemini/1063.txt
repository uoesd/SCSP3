Petito Case Unrelated to Moab Double Homicide

North Port Police Department – The disappearance of Gabrielle "Gabby" Petito is not connected to the double homicide involving Kylen Schulte and Crystal Turner in Moab, Utah, according to the Grand County Sheriff's Office.

Petito, 22, vanished while on a cross-country trip with her fiancé, Brian Laundrie. She was last in contact with her family in late August 2021. Schulte, 24, and Turner, 38, were found shot to death near Moab on Aug. 18, last seen alive on Aug. 13.

"We have no evidence to connect the two cases," said Grand County Sheriff Steven White.

Laundrie returned to Florida alone on Sept. 1 and is considered a person of interest in Petito's disappearance. He has refused to cooperate with investigators and has since disappeared.

Petito and Laundrie visited Moab in mid-August, and police responded to a domestic problem between them on Aug. 12. No charges were pressed, but the couple was separated for the night by police.

"The incident involved some sort of altercation between the two parties," said Moab Police Chief Bret Edge. "We separated them for the night and sent them on their way."

Schulte had mentioned a "creepy man" near their campsite to friends, fearing for their safety.

"She had told me that there was a man that was kind of creeping her out," said friend Jessica Groves. "She said he was kind of hanging around their campsite."

A $10,000 reward is being offered for information related to the Schulte-Turner double homicide case.

"We are asking for the public's help in solving this case," said White. "Any information, no matter how small, could be helpful."

North Port Police and the FBI continue to investigate Petito's disappearance.

"We are following up on every lead and every tip that comes in," said North Port Police Chief Todd Garrison. "We are committed to finding Gabby and bringing her home."

Laundrie has not been charged with any crime in connection with Petito's disappearance. However, he has been named a person of interest by the North Port Police Department.

"We believe that Brian Laundrie knows more about Gabby's disappearance than he is letting on," said Garrison. "We are urging him to come forward and cooperate with our investigation."

The Petito family has expressed frustration with the lack of progress in the investigation.

"We just want to know what happened to Gabby," said Petito's father, Joe. "We deserve answers."

The Schulte-Turner family is also seeking justice for their loved ones.

"We want to know who did this and why," said Schulte's mother, Cindy. "We deserve closure."

The investigations into both cases are ongoing.
