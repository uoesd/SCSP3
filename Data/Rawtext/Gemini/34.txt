Melania Trump Learns of Inauguration Absence via Trump's Tweet

Former First Lady Melania Trump was reportedly unaware of her husband's decision to skip President Biden's inauguration until he announced it on Twitter on January 8.

According to a senior White House staffer, Melania had been uncertain if President Trump would break tradition by not attending. "She didn't know for sure until he tweeted it," the staffer said.

Melania Trump has largely remained silent about the efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. However, she did support her husband's calls for "fair elections" after his loss.

The White House staffer revealed that Melania often learns of her husband's actions through his tweets. "She's not always in the loop," the staffer said.

Melania has been preparing for life post-Washington, D.C., including moving belongings to Mar-a-Lago. She also arranged for her son, Barron, to attend school in Florida.

Following the Capitol insurrection on January 6, Melania remained silent for five days. She eventually released a statement expressing sympathy for the rioters and police officers who died that day.

However, she also accused critics of spreading "salacious gossip" and "false misleading accusations" against her.

"I find it shameful that surrounding these tragic events there has been salacious gossip, unwarranted personal attacks, and false misleading accusations on me - from people who are looking to be relevant and have an agenda," Melania said in her statement.

Melania's silence and subsequent statement have been met with criticism from some. However, others have defended her right to privacy and her decision to focus on her family.

As the Trump family prepares to leave the White House, Melania's future plans remain uncertain. However, it is clear that she is eager to move on from the tumultuous events of the past four years.

"She's ready to get out of the spotlight and focus on her family," the White House staffer said.
