No Fourth Stimulus Check Proposal as Congress Focuses on Other Priorities

Washington CNN – Despite some Democratic support for recurring payments, there is currently no proposal for a fourth round of stimulus checks as Congress focuses on other priorities.

The slim majorities in both the House and Senate, as well as the previous focus on limiting the third round of payments, make further direct payments unlikely. Lawmakers are now concentrating on a massive infrastructure bill and President Biden's American Families Plan, neither of which includes direct payments.

However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is still making payment adjustments for those who lost income in 2020 and are due more from the third round of payments. These "plus-up" payments are automatically going to individuals whose 2020 tax returns show they qualified for more based on their income.

In addition, the expanded child tax credit payments, as part of the pandemic aid package passed in March, will begin on July 15. More than 36 million families are eligible for the child tax credit payments, which will be periodic.

Eligible parents will receive up to $3,600 for each child under 6 and $3,000 for each child under 18, an increase from the previous maximum of $2,000. The enhanced child tax credit will benefit single parents making up to $75,000 and joint filers making up to $150,000 a year.

The child tax credit has also been made fully refundable, potentially benefiting 20 million more children. This means that even families with no tax liability will receive the full amount of the credit.

The expanded child tax credit is expected to reduce child poverty by 40%, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It is also expected to provide significant financial relief to working families.

The IRS is urging families to file their 2020 tax returns as soon as possible to ensure they receive the full amount of the child tax credit. Families can also use the IRS's Child Tax Credit Update Portal to check their eligibility and update their information.

The child tax credit payments will be made on a monthly basis from July through December. Families can choose to receive the payments by direct deposit, check, or debit card.

The expanded child tax credit is a significant investment in children and families. It is expected to provide much-needed financial relief and reduce child poverty.
