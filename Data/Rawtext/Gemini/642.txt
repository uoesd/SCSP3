Lone Survivor in Rittenhouse Case Admits Pointing Gun Before Being Shot

KENOSHA – Gaige Grosskreutz, the lone survivor shot by Kyle Rittenhouse during the 2020 Kenosha protests, admitted on the witness stand Wednesday that he unholstered his gun and pointed it at Rittenhouse before being shot.

Grosskreutz, a trained paramedic, testified that he was not intending to kill Rittenhouse but was trying to preserve his own life. His testimony appeared to bolster Rittenhouse's self-defense claim, acknowledging that he believed Rittenhouse was being chased with intent to harm.

"I was trying to preserve my own life," Grosskreutz said. "I was trying to stop the defendant from killing me."

Grosskreutz, 28, organized a medical corps at protests and was carrying a gun and providing first aid during the Kenosha protests. Unlike Rittenhouse, Grosskreutz obtained his firearm through proper channels and was certified as an EMT.

Grosskreutz did not consider himself to be participating in the protests but was there in a medical and protective capacity.

"I was there to provide medical aid to anyone who needed it," Grosskreutz said. "I was not there to cause trouble."

Grosskreutz accused Rittenhouse of "murdering" another individual, Anthony Huber, but the judge instructed the jury to disregard the comment.

Grosskreutz's testimony revealed that he might have unintentionally pointed his gun at Rittenhouse.

"I don't recall pointing my gun at the defendant," Grosskreutz said. "But it's possible that I did."

Grosskreutz underwent several surgeries after the shooting, losing sensation below the elbow of the injured arm.

Grosskreutz filed a $10 million lawsuit against Kenosha law enforcement, claiming they shared blame for Rittenhouse's actions.

Background of the Case

On August 25, 2020, Rittenhouse, then 17, shot and killed two men and wounded Grosskreutz during a night of unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The shootings occurred amid protests sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man.

Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, and attempted first-degree intentional homicide. He has claimed self-defense, arguing that he fired his rifle only after being attacked by the victims.

Grosskreutz's Testimony

Grosskreutz testified that he was providing medical aid to protesters when he saw Rittenhouse running down the street with a rifle. He said he followed Rittenhouse to try to talk him down.

"I wanted to de-escalate the situation," Grosskreutz said. "I didn't want anyone to get hurt."

Grosskreutz said that Rittenhouse turned and pointed his rifle at him. He said he then unholstered his own gun and pointed it at Rittenhouse.

"I was trying to stop him from shooting me," Grosskreutz said. "I didn't want to kill him."

Rittenhouse fired his rifle, striking Grosskreutz in the arm. Grosskreutz fell to the ground and Rittenhouse ran away.

Grosskreutz was taken to the hospital, where he underwent surgery. He has since recovered from his injuries but has lost sensation below the elbow of his injured arm.

Cross-Examination

During cross-examination, Rittenhouse's attorney, Mark Richards, questioned Grosskreutz about his actions leading up to the shooting. Richards suggested that Grosskreutz was the aggressor and that he had pointed his gun at Rittenhouse before Rittenhouse fired.

Grosskreutz denied that he was the aggressor. He said that he was only trying to protect himself and others from Rittenhouse.

Impact of Grosskreutz's Testimony

Grosskreutz's testimony is expected to have a significant impact on the trial. His admission that he pointed his gun at Rittenhouse could bolster Rittenhouse's self-defense claim.

However, Grosskreutz's testimony also revealed that he was not trying to kill Rittenhouse but was only trying to protect himself. This could undermine Rittenhouse's claim that he fired his rifle in self-defense.

The trial is expected to continue for several more weeks. The jury will ultimately decide whether Rittenhouse is guilty of the charges against him.
