Hurricane Ida Ravages Houma Hospitals Amid COVID-19 Surge

HOUMA, La. (AP) – Hurricane Ida, one of the most powerful hurricanes in U.S. history, ravaged south Louisiana, leaving a trail of destruction that included severe damage to hospitals in Houma.

Leonard J. Chabert Medical Center, the city's main hospital, faced a double whammy as Ida hit. The hurricane brought torrential rains that poured water from the ceiling, causing structural damage. At the same time, the hospital was already overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients due to a brutal surge of cases in the community.

"It was like a war zone," said Richard Zuschlag, owner of Acadian Ambulance Service. "The water was coming down from the ceiling, and the wind was howling."

Evacuating or discharging patients was not feasible. Many were in critical condition, and other hospitals were filled to capacity with COVID patients. The combination of a catastrophic hurricane and the COVID-19 pandemic put unprecedented mental stress on healthcare workers.

"We were all terrified," said a nurse who worked at Chabert during the storm. "We didn't know if the building was going to collapse. We prayed together for protection."

Terrebonne General Health System, another hospital in Houma, also sustained severe damage. The roof collapsed in several places, and windows were shattered. Both hospitals had to coordinate a massive evacuation following the damage from the hurricane.

"It was a perfect twin-demic," said Dr. Chuck Burnell, chief medical officer of Acadian Ambulance. "We had a major hurricane on top of a COVID surge. It was unprecedented."

Acadian Ambulance evacuated over 100 patients from Terrebonne General, many of whom had COVID. "It was a very difficult evacuation," said Burnell. "We had to transport patients who were on ventilators and other life support systems."

The simultaneous occurrence of the hurricane and the COVID-19 surge highlighted the unparalleled impact of the twin disasters. Healthcare workers in Houma faced unimaginable challenges, working tirelessly to save lives amidst the chaos and destruction.

"We're all exhausted," said a doctor at Chabert. "But we're also proud of what we've accomplished. We saved lives, and we're going to continue to do everything we can to help our community recover."
