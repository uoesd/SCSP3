Parents of Michigan School Shooting Suspect Charged with Involuntary Manslaughter

PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) – The parents of the teenager accused of killing four students at Oxford High School in Michigan have been charged with involuntary manslaughter, prosecutors announced Friday.

James and Jennifer Crumbley were arraigned on four counts each of involuntary manslaughter, one for each of the students killed in the Nov. 30 shooting. They pleaded not guilty and were ordered held on $500,000 bond each.

Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said the charges stem from the parents' alleged failure to intervene despite numerous warnings about their son Ethan's disturbing behavior, including a chilling drawing found at his desk.

"The Crumbleys had ample opportunity to intervene and prevent the events of November 30," McDonald said. "They failed to do so, and as a result, four students were killed and seven others were injured."

Ethan Crumbley, 15, is charged as an adult with murder and terrorism. He is accused of opening fire on his classmates with a semi-automatic handgun, killing Tate Myre, 16; Hana St. Juliana, 14; Madisyn Baldwin, 17; and Justin Shilling, 17.

According to McDonald, the Crumbleys bought the gun for Ethan as a Christmas present just four days before the shooting. They allegedly failed to secure the weapon and resisted efforts by school officials to remove Ethan from school on the day of the shooting.

"The Crumbleys' actions and inaction led to the deaths of four innocent children," McDonald said. "They must be held accountable."

The U.S. Marshals Service is offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to the arrest of the Crumbleys. However, their attorney, Shannon Smith, said they are not on the run.

"The Crumbleys are innocent of the charges against them," Smith said. "They are not fleeing and will return to court to face these charges."

School officials had previously been alarmed by Ethan's behavior, McDonald said. In the weeks leading up to the shooting, he was caught searching for ammunition on his phone and had been seen drawing violent images.

On the morning of the shooting, a teacher found a note on Ethan's desk with violent drawings and messages, including one that said, "I will kill everyone." The teacher reported the note to school officials, who called the Crumbleys and told them to get Ethan counseling.

However, the Crumbleys allegedly did not take their son home or remove him from school. Instead, they left him there with the gun, McDonald said.

After the shooting, Jennifer Crumbley texted Ethan urging him not to proceed, and James Crumbley reported a gun missing from their home, McDonald said.

The firearm used in the shooting was purchased by Ethan's father and openly posted about on social media, McDonald said.

McDonald said she is not ruling out charges against school officials, but said the investigation is ongoing.

"We are looking at all aspects of this case, including the actions of school officials," McDonald said. "We will follow the evidence wherever it leads."

Sheriff Mike Bouchard said the Crumbleys' arrest is a significant step in the investigation.

"We believe that the Crumbleys' actions contributed to the deaths of these four students," Bouchard said. "We are committed to holding them accountable."

The Crumbleys are scheduled to return to court for a preliminary hearing on Jan. 14.
