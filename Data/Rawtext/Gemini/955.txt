Guest Reflects on Tumultuous Three Months in Congress

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) – Republican Representative Michael Guest of Mississippi recently sat down with WLBT to discuss his views on recent events that have rocked the nation, including the election, Capitol insurrection, and impeachment.

Guest acknowledged that the past three months have been unprecedented in modern U.S. history. "We've had an election, a Capitol insurrection, and an impeachment," he said. "It's been a lot to take in."

Election and Voter Irregularities

Regarding the election, Guest said he believes there were voter irregularities but not enough to overturn the results. "I think there were some irregularities, but I don't think they were widespread enough to change the outcome of the election," he said.

Guest challenged the certification of election results in Pennsylvania and Arizona, citing violations of legislative will, not widespread fraud. "I think the state legislatures should have had more say in how the election was conducted," he said.

Capitol Insurrection

Guest was present at the Capitol during the insurrection and described the experience as "surreal." "I was in the House chamber when the rioters broke in," he said. "It was a very chaotic and frightening experience."

Guest believes there is shared blame for the Capitol insurrection, not solely resting on Trump. "I think there are a lot of people who share responsibility for what happened that day," he said. "I think the President bears some responsibility, but I also think there were other people who helped to incite the violence."

Marjorie Taylor Greene

Guest disagrees with many statements made by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene but opposes using those to remove her from committees. "I think she's said some very outlandish things," he said. "But I don't think we should remove her from committees just because we disagree with her."

Guest supports a proposal to remove Greene from the Education and Labor Committee but allow her to remain on the Budget Committee. "I think that's a fair compromise," he said. "It allows her to continue to serve on a committee where she can have a voice, but it also removes her from a committee where she could do some damage."

Challenges Facing Congress

The conversation with Guest reflected on the challenges and controversies facing Congress in light of recent political events. "I think we're facing a lot of challenges right now," he said. "But I'm hopeful that we can come together and find common ground."

Guest believes that Congress needs to focus on the issues that matter most to the American people. "We need to focus on things like the economy, healthcare, and education," he said. "We need to put the American people first."
