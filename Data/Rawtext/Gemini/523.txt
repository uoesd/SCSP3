Hurricane Ida Wreaks Havoc on 'Dukes of Hazzard' Studios, Damaging Iconic General Lee Cars

Hurricane Ida's wrath has left a trail of destruction in its wake, including damage to John Schneider's studios in Holden, Louisiana. Among the casualties are two iconic General Lee cars from the beloved television series 'The Dukes of Hazzard'.

"One of the General Lees was crushed by the storm, and another was found stuck in a tree," said Schneider, who portrayed Bo Duke in the show. Despite the devastation, Schneider maintains a positive outlook. "I'm just laughing about it," he said. "It's just stuff."

The General Lee has been a subject of controversy due to its Confederate flag and namesake, Civil War General Robert E. Lee. In 2015, TV Land and Warner Bros. discontinued reruns of the show and halted production of General Lee toy cars.

Schneider has defended the General Lee, stating that it never caused issues with African American fans. "The show was about family and friendship," he said. "It was never about the flag."

Schneider believes the show's characterization as divisive is unfair and could impact its legacy. "It's a shame that people are trying to rewrite history," he said. "The show brought people together."

Amidst the hurricane relief efforts, Schneider is actively involved in helping those affected in Tennessee. He encourages support for those impacted by natural disasters. "We need to come together as a community and help each other out," he said.

Schneider has requested assistance for his damaged studios through his studio's website. Additionally, donations for broader hurricane relief efforts can be made to the United Way of Southeast Louisiana or the Red Cross.
