Capitol Riot Arrests Divide Small Pennsylvania Town

KANE, Pa. (AP) – The arrest of a local restaurant owner for her participation in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot has ignited partisan bickering in this small Pennsylvania town, exposing deep political divisions that mirror those playing out across the nation.

Pauline Bauer, 54, and her longtime friend William Blauser Jr., 62, are among the hundreds charged in connection with the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Bauer, who owns Kane's Corner Cafe, was recorded shouting at police during the riot, demanding that they bring out House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to be hanged.

The charges against Bauer and Blauser have sent shockwaves through Kane, a town of about 3,500 people located in the Allegheny National Forest. The arrests have divided the community, with some residents expressing support for the accused while others condemn their actions.

"It's a very divisive issue," said Joe Lanich, owner of The Laughing Owl Press Co., a local newspaper. "There are people who are very angry with them, and there are people who are very supportive."

Bauer and Blauser were arrested in May after video evidence showed them entering the Capitol and participating in the riot. They have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include conspiracy, obstruction of an official proceeding, and disorderly conduct.

Bauer, who became outspoken against COVID-19 lockdown measures, has embraced ideologies aligned with the sovereign citizens movement, which rejects the authority of the government. She has expressed support for former President Donald Trump and his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.

Blauser, who has been advised by his attorney to avoid Bauer, continues to support her, highlighting their friendship.

"She's been a friend of mine for a long time," Blauser said. "I'm not going to turn my back on her."

The division over the Capitol riot reflects broader political splits in the United States, with significant differences in views across party lines. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that 82% of Republicans believe the 2020 election was stolen, while only 18% of Democrats hold that view.

In Kane, a town that strongly supported Trump in the 2020 election, many still display pro-Trump signs. The town's mayor, Brandy Schimp, said she has received numerous calls from residents expressing their support for Bauer and Blauser.

"There are a lot of people in this town who believe that they were doing the right thing," Schimp said. "They believe that the election was stolen, and they were trying to protect their country."

However, others in the community have condemned the actions of Bauer and Blauser. Glenn Robinson, a local resident, said he was "disgusted" by their involvement in the Capitol riot.

"They betrayed their country," Robinson said. "They should be punished to the fullest extent of the law."

The cases of those charged in the Capitol riot are proceeding, with some already pleading guilty or being sentenced. Bauer and Blauser are scheduled to appear in court again in September.

The charges against Bauer and Blauser have had a significant impact on their lives. Bauer's restaurant has faced boycotts, and she has lost some friends. Blauser has been suspended from his job as a truck driver.

Despite the controversy, Bauer claims her actions haven't harmed her friendships or business. She said her regular customers still support her, and she has no plans to close her restaurant.

"I'm not going to let them win," Bauer said. "I'm going to keep fighting for what I believe in."

The division over the Capitol riot in Kane is a microcosm of the broader political divide in the United States. As the cases of those charged in the riot proceed, it remains to be seen how these divisions will play out in the months and years to come.
