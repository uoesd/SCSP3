Tate Myre, Oxford Hero, Honored as Michigan State Signee

In a poignant tribute to a fallen hero, Michigan State University (MSU) has posthumously signed Tate Myre, a victim of the tragic Oxford High School shooting, to its football team.

Myre, a standout athlete who played tight end, linebacker, and running back for the Oxford Wildcats, was praised for his bravery during the shooting. Witnesses said he ran toward the shooter in an attempt to stop him.

"Tate was a great young man who loved football and had a bright future ahead of him," said MSU head football coach Mel Tucker. "We are honored to have him as an honorary member of our Spartan family."

Myre had planned to visit Michigan State for a recruiting visit just days before the attack. In a tribute video, Tucker highlighted Myre's work ethic, athleticism, and passion for football.

"Tate was a tough, physical player who always gave 100%," Tucker said. "He was a leader on and off the field, and he will be deeply missed."

Myre's signing comes as the Oxford community continues to mourn the loss of three other students who were killed in the shooting: Madisyn Baldwin, Hana St. Juliana, and Justin Shilling.

"Tate was a special young man who always put others before himself," said Ross Wingert, Myre's coach in football and wrestling. "He was a true hero, and we will never forget him."

Myre's heroism has been recognized by the college and professional football communities. NFL players, including Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff, wore custom jerseys with Myre's name and number. The Michigan football team also honored Myre with a patch on their uniforms.

"Tate's story is an inspiration to us all," Tucker said. "He showed us what it means to be a true Spartan, and we will carry his memory with us always."

The shooter, a 15-year-old student, and his parents face charges related to the shooting. The investigation into the incident is ongoing.

Myre's legacy will live on through the lives he touched and the impact he made on his community. He will be remembered as a hero who sacrificed his life to protect others.
