Rittenhouse Attorney Argues Victim Sought to Steal Gun

Kenosha, Wis. - The defense attorney for Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager charged with killing two people during protests in Kenosha last year, is seeking to argue that one of the victims was a sex offender who was aiming to steal Rittenhouse's gun.

Attorney Mark Richards filed a motion on Tuesday arguing that Joseph Rosenbaum, one of the two men Rittenhouse shot and killed, started the altercation by trying to take Rittenhouse's firearm. Richards said this reinforces Rittenhouse's claim of self-defense.

"The evidence is clear that Mr. Rosenbaum was the aggressor in this case," Richards said in a statement. "He was the one who initiated the physical confrontation with Mr. Rittenhouse, and he was the one who attempted to take Mr. Rittenhouse's firearm."

Kimberley Motley, the attorney representing Rosenbaum's estate, disputed Richards' theory, asserting that Rittenhouse was the aggressor.

"There is no evidence to support the claim that Mr. Rosenbaum was trying to steal Mr. Rittenhouse's gun," Motley said. "The evidence shows that Mr. Rittenhouse was the one who instigated the confrontation, and he was the one who fired the shots that killed Mr. Rosenbaum."

Richards also filed a motion to dismiss the gun possession charge against Rittenhouse, arguing that Wisconsin law doesn't apply to the type of rifle he was carrying. Rittenhouse, now 18, was charged with multiple counts, including reckless homicide and being a minor in possession of a dangerous weapon.

Rittenhouse had traveled to Kenosha from Illinois amid protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Prosecutors want to introduce evidence of Rittenhouse's prior alleged violent conduct and links to the far-right group Proud Boys.

Richards contends that the prior altercation and Proud Boys association are irrelevant to the case.

"The state's attempt to introduce evidence of Mr. Rittenhouse's prior alleged violent conduct and his association with the Proud Boys is nothing more than an attempt to smear him and prejudice the jury," Richards said.

The incident has polarized opinions, painting Rittenhouse either as a white supremacist or a gun rights symbol.

A hearing on the motions is scheduled for Sept. 17, with Rittenhouse's trial set to begin on Nov. 1.
