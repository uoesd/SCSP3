Golden State Stimulus II: Third Round of Payments to Reach 9 Million Californians

Sacramento, Calif. - Nearly 9 million Californians are set to receive a third batch of Golden State Stimulus II payments starting Oct. 5, as part of the state's $100 billion California Comeback Plan.

The payments, which will be distributed in the form of direct deposits or paper checks, are intended to provide financial relief to low- and middle-income Californians who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Expanded Eligibility

Eligibility for the $600 payments has expanded under Golden State Stimulus II compared to the initial round of payments. This time, qualifying families with dependents could receive an additional $500, bringing their total potential relief to $1,100.

To qualify for the payments, individuals must have been a California resident for more than half of the 2020 tax year and have filed 2020 taxes by Oct. 15, 2021. Income limits for eligibility are set at $75,000 or less for the 2020 tax year, and recipients cannot be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer.

Distribution Timeline

Direct deposit payments are expected to be sent out before Oct. 31, while paper checks will be distributed between Oct. 6 and January of the following year. Stimulus payments will be sent out approximately every two weeks.

Paper check delivery is organized by the last three digits of recipients' ZIP codes as listed on their 2020 tax return. For example, those with ZIP codes ending in 000-199 will receive their checks between Oct. 6 and Oct. 15, while those with ZIP codes ending in 200-399 will receive their checks between Oct. 16 and Oct. 29.

Protection from Debt Collection

It's important to note that state stimulus payments are protected from being seized for debts like child support or owed to state agencies. This means that recipients can use the funds without fear of them being taken away to satisfy outstanding obligations.

Additional Relief Measures

The Golden State Stimulus II payments are part of a broader package of relief measures included in the California Comeback Plan. Other measures include:

  • $1.1 billion in rental assistance
  • $2 billion in utility bill assistance
  • $500 million in food assistance
  • $2 billion in small business grants

Economic Impact

The Golden State Stimulus II payments are expected to have a significant impact on California's economy. The influx of funds will provide a much-needed boost to consumer spending and help businesses recover from the pandemic.
