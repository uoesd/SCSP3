Gabby Petito Case Revives Hope for Missing Geologist Daniel Robinson

The tragic discovery of Gabby Petito's body has cast a renewed spotlight on the unsolved disappearance of Daniel Robinson, a geologist who vanished in the Arizona desert over two months ago.

Robinson, 24, was last seen leaving a job site near Sun Valley Parkway and Cactus Road on June 23. His damaged 2017 blue Jeep Renegade was found on July 19 near a ravine, containing personal items but no sign of Daniel.

"It's been a nightmare," said David Robinson II, Daniel's father. "We're just desperate for any information that can lead us to him."

Daniel, who is missing his right forearm and hand, is described as 5-foot-8 with black hair and brown eyes. A human skull found on July 31 was not identified as Daniel's, and investigators have ruled out foul play.

Private investigator Jeff McGrath, hired by the Robinson family, has uncovered new details about the Jeep's movements after the crash. "The Jeep was driven 11 miles post-crash, with several attempts to restart the engine," McGrath said.

An online petition calling for further investigation by police has garnered over 5,700 signatures. "We need to keep the pressure on," said Shayla Davis, who started the petition. "Daniel deserves to be found."

The Buckeye Police Department, which is leading the investigation, maintains that they have thoroughly searched and analyzed evidence but have found no new leads on Daniel's whereabouts.

"We understand the family's frustration," said Buckeye Police Chief Larry Hall. "We are committed to finding Daniel, but we need the public's help."

The Robinson family has initiated a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for a private investigation and search efforts. Over $34,000 has been raised so far.

"We won't give up hope," said David Robinson II. "We have to find Daniel."
