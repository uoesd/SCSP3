Tiger Woods Crash: Experts Suspect Inattention or Unconsciousness

Los Angeles, California - Forensic car accident experts are raising questions about the initial assessment of Tiger Woods' single-vehicle crash as an accident, suggesting that inattention or even unconsciousness may have played a role.

Evidence Points to Inattention

According to Jonathan Cherney, a consultant and car accident analysis expert witness, the evidence at the scene suggests that Woods did not lose control due to excessive speed but rather inattention. "There were no skid marks, which indicates that he didn't brake hard before the crash," Cherney said. "This is consistent with someone who is asleep or not paying attention."

Felix Lee, an accident reconstruction expert with the Expert Institute, agrees. "The vehicle traveled straight on a curved road, went off the road, hit a tree, and rolled over," Lee explained. "This suggests that Woods was not in control of the vehicle and may have been unconscious or asleep until he was off-road."

Late Brake Application Raises Suspicions

Rami Hashish, Principal of the National Biomechanics Institute, believes that the late brake application is a key piece of evidence. "The vehicle's anti-lock brakes may have prevented skid marks, but the fact that Woods braked so late suggests that he was possibly unconscious or asleep until he was off-road," Hashish said.

Sheriff's Quick Determination Questioned

Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva and other officials have labeled the crash an accident, though impairment has been ruled out. However, forensic experts question the quick determination without analyzing the vehicle's black box or Woods' medical data for medication.

"It's premature to rule out negligence," Cherney said. "We need to see the black box data and Woods' medical records to determine if there were any other factors that contributed to the crash."

Woods' Previous Incident Raises Concerns

In 2017, Woods was found asleep at the wheel with several substances in his system, raising questions about possible medication at the time of the crash. "This previous incident should be taken into account when investigating the current crash," Lee said.

Experts Criticize Initial Assessment

Forensic experts are criticizing the initial assessment of the crash as an accident, suggesting that negligence might be involved. "The evidence suggests that Woods was not in control of the vehicle and may have been unconscious or asleep," Hashish said. "This should be investigated thoroughly before any conclusions are drawn."

Woods Recovering from Surgery

Woods is recovering from surgery and is in good spirits, according to Sheriff's Deputy Graciela Medrano. "He is resting comfortably and is expected to make a full recovery," Medrano said. No further updates on his condition have been released.

Investigation Ongoing

The investigation into the crash is ongoing, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is working with the California Highway Patrol to determine the exact cause. The results of the investigation are expected to be released in the coming weeks.
