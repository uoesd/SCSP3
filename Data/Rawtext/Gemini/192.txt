Colonial Pipeline CEO Defends Ransom Payment, Admits Cybersecurity Lapses

NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) – Colonial Pipeline CEO Joseph Blount testified before U.S. senators on Tuesday, acknowledging cybersecurity lapses that led to a ransomware attack that disrupted fuel supplies last month.

Blount told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that hackers gained access to the company's network by stealing a single password for a legacy virtual private network (VPN) system that lacked multifactor authentication.

"We have to do a better job of protecting ourselves," Blount said. "We have to invest more in cybersecurity."

The attack, part of a broader pattern of cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure, has spurred discussions on improving cybersecurity readiness. Senators expressed concern about Colonial's lack of a ransomware prevention plan and questioned the decision to pay the ransom.

"I'm concerned that paying the ransom has set a precedent that will encourage more attacks," said Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio).

Blount defended the ransom payment decision, saying it was a necessary action to protect the company's customers and the public.

"We made the decision to pay the ransom because we believed it was the best way to get our systems back online quickly and safely," Blount said.

Colonial Pipeline has invested over $200 million in its IT systems over the past five years, but Blount did not provide details on cybersecurity spending.

The FBI attributed the hack to a group called DarkSide, and there were suggestions that Colonial did not consult the U.S. government sufficiently before paying the ransom.

"I'm concerned that Colonial did not consult with the U.S. government before paying the ransom," said Senator Gary Peters (D-Mich.). "This could have compromised our national security."

Blount said that Colonial did consult with the FBI, but he acknowledged that the company could have done more to communicate with the government.

The Justice Department recovered some of the ransom paid in cryptocurrency, but due to fluctuating bitcoin value, the recovery fell short of the total paid.

"We are increasing our focus on tracking digital currency transactions related to ransomware," said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. "This is a growing national security concern."

The Colonial Pipeline attack has highlighted the need for better cybersecurity practices, particularly in critical infrastructure sectors.

"This attack is a wake-up call for all of us," said Senator Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.). "We need to do more to protect our critical infrastructure from cyberattacks."

Blount said that Colonial is committed to improving its cybersecurity posture.

"We are taking this attack very seriously," Blount said. "We are working with the FBI and other government agencies to investigate the attack and improve our cybersecurity defenses."

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is continuing its investigation into the Colonial Pipeline attack.
