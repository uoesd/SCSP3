Prince Harry and Pula: A Tail-Wagging Day at the Beach

Prince Harry was spotted enjoying a leisurely afternoon at a Santa Barbara beach, where he played fetch with his beloved black Labrador, Pula. The Duke of Sussex appeared relaxed and casual, a testament to how at home he and his family have become in their new Montecito neighborhood.

Pula, a rescue dog adopted by Harry and Meghan Markle after their wedding, holds a special place in their hearts. Her name, which means "rain" in Botswana, symbolizes a blessing and reflects the couple's deep connection to the African country. Pula made a memorable appearance during Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah Winfrey, offering a glimpse into their family life.

The royal family also includes Meghan's rescue beagle, Guy, and their son, Archie. A recent video shared by the couple shows the family enjoying a fun-filled day at the beach, with Pula and Archie frolicking in the sand.

Harry and Meghan's decision to relocate to Santa Barbara was driven by their desire to provide an outdoor-oriented lifestyle for their family. Archie, in particular, benefits from the fresh air and open spaces. Harry has often spoken about the importance of walks and beach visits for his family's well-being.

"We've got a beautiful house and garden," Harry told Oprah. "We've got Archie running around, we've got the dogs, and we've got each other."
