FBI Chief Debunks False Claims, But Avoids Denouncing QAnon-Endorsing Lawmakers

Washington CNN – FBI Director Chris Wray testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, debunking claims that the January 6 Capitol rioters were "fake Trump protesters" or that Antifa was involved in the violence.

"We have not seen evidence that Antifa or other left-wing extremist groups were involved in the attack on the Capitol," Wray stated. "The vast majority of those who breached the Capitol were Trump supporters."

Wray's testimony contradicts claims made by some Republican lawmakers and conservative media outlets that the Capitol riot was a false flag operation orchestrated by left-wing groups.

Over 260 defendants have been charged in federal court for their actions during the Capitol siege, and the vast majority have shown allegiance to former President Donald Trump.

Wray also refuted widespread voter fraud claims in the 2020 election, which have been promoted by Trump and some of his allies.

"We have not seen any evidence that would lead us to believe that the election was stolen or that there was widespread voter fraud," Wray said.

Despite debunking these false claims, Wray did not denounce lawmakers who endorse QAnon conspiracy theories.

"I'm not going to comment on any specific elected official," Wray said. "But I will say that we are concerned about the proliferation of conspiracy theories and the potential for them to inspire violence."

Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) expressed disappointment over Wray's reluctance to condemn elected officials who amplify QAnon theories.

"I'm very disappointed that Director Wray did not denounce those who are spreading these dangerous conspiracy theories," Blumenthal said. "These theories are a threat to our democracy and they need to be called out."

Wray defended the FBI's sharing of the "Norfolk memo," an intelligence report about potential threats before the Capitol attack.

The Norfolk report was shared with law enforcement, including the Capitol Police, through email, a verbal briefing, and a law enforcement portal.

Wray admitted that he did not see the Norfolk report until after January 6 and mentioned the challenge of sharing intelligence across departments.

"We are working to improve our intelligence sharing," Wray said. "But it is a complex and challenging task."

The FBI is aiming to develop better sources for gaining intelligence on domestic extremists, with arrests providing valuable information.

"We are working to develop better sources of intelligence on domestic extremists," Wray said. "We are also working to build relationships with law enforcement partners to share information and coordinate our efforts."
