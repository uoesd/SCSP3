Congress Confirms Biden-Harris Victory After Capitol Riot

In a historic and somber session, Congress on Thursday confirmed the election results of President-elect Joseph R. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris, hours after a violent incident where a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol. The confirmation came after a joint session of Congress convened to certify the electoral votes, a process that was disrupted by the mob's attack.

In a statement read on the Senate floor, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell condemned the violence, emphasizing that "violence does not lead to victory, freedom does." He also noted that one senator, Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, had reconsidered her intention to object to the certification of electoral votes due to the events at the Capitol, stating that she could not in good conscience object.

The Senate rejected an objection to the electoral votes from Pennsylvania with a vote of 7 ayes to 92 nays. The House of Representatives also rejected the objection, with a vote of 138 ayes to 297 nays. The final tally showed that Joseph R. Biden Jr. received 306 electoral votes while Donald J. Trump received 232 electoral votes for the presidency. Kamala D. Harris received 306 electoral votes while Michael R. Pence received 232 electoral votes for the vice presidency.

A total of 538 electors were appointed, with a majority of 270 required to win the presidency. The certification of the electoral votes for President and Vice President will be entered into the journals of the Senate and the House of Representatives, officially confirming the results of the 2020 election.
