GRAMBLING, La. (KNOE) – Grambling State University's World Famed Tiger Marching Band has been invited to perform at the inauguration festivities for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris.

The performance will be part of a virtual event entitled "We Are One," which was recently added to the inaugural schedule.

"This is a historic moment for Grambling State University and for the entire HBCU community," said GSU President Rick Gallot. "We are honored to be a part of this celebration, especially given the significance of Vice President-elect Harris being the first HBCU graduate to serve in this role."

Director of Bands Dr. Nikole Roebuck expressed her pride in the band's invitation to perform at the event. "It is an incredible honor to be asked to represent Grambling State University and the HBCU community at such a momentous occasion," she said.

The Tiger Marching Band has a long history of performing at presidential inaugurations. They previously performed at the inaugurations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and Bill Clinton has also performed with them at GSU.

The "We Are One" event featuring the Tiger Marching Band is scheduled for January 19, 2021, at 7:00 p.m. CST. The band will participate in a Battle of the Bands segment, along with other notable groups from various universities.

The event will be available to watch on multiple platforms, including Urban One, BET, NBC Peacock TV, and others.
