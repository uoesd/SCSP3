Vistra Raises Uri Storm Cost Estimate to $1.6 Billion

April 26 – Vistra Corp (VST.N) on Monday increased its cost estimate for February's winter storm Uri to about $1.6 billion, up from its previous estimate of $900 million to $1.3 billion.

The new estimate excludes potential recoveries from legal and regulatory challenges.

Vistra also reissued its 2021 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow guidance.

The revised EBITDA range is $1,475-$1,875 million, and the free cash flow range is $200-$600 million. Before the storm, Vistra estimated significantly higher EBITDA and free cash flow for 2021.

"During the storm, we generated more power than our market share, and we did so safely and reliably," said Chief Executive Curt Morgan.

However, Vistra faced high costs due to unfulfilled gas contracts and had to buy power at high prices.

"Absent the gas deliverability and cost issues, Uri would have had a slightly positive impact on 2021 EBITDA," Morgan said.

Vistra said it will not buy additional shares in 2021 but will maintain its quarterly dividend.

The company's shares were down 0.7% in premarket trading.
