Inauguration Security Heightened Amid Concerns of Violence and IEDs

Washington CNN – With just days remaining until President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, security measures in Washington, D.C., are being ramped up significantly. Over 20,000 National Guard members are expected to be deployed to the city to assist with security efforts, as concerns mount over the potential for violence and the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

The US Secret Service, which is officially in charge of Biden's inauguration security, has expressed concerns about the possibility of IEDs being used in unrest related to the event. FBI Director Chris Wray has also warned of extremists at planned rallies and potential violence.

"We are concerned about the potential for violence at multiple rallies that we are aware of," Wray said. "We are also concerned about the potential for violence at the Capitol itself."

In response to these concerns, security perimeters are being expanded around the Capitol, White House, and National Naval Observatory. The massive security operation involves coordination among the Secret Service, federal law enforcement agencies, and the Pentagon.

The total request for National Guard support is close to 30,000, with an expected final need of approximately 20,000. This number exceeds the number of active-duty US troops currently deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria combined.

"We are taking all necessary steps to ensure a safe and secure inauguration," said Robert Contee, Washington, D.C., Police Chief. "We are working closely with our federal partners to identify and mitigate any potential threats."

Discussions are also underway about possibly raising the national terror threat level.

"We are constantly assessing the threat environment and will make adjustments as necessary," said Ken Cuccinelli, DHS Senior Official performing the duties of the Deputy Secretary.

The Secret Service is leading inauguration security efforts amid concerns of increased potential for attacks following the Capitol breach on January 6.

"We are taking unprecedented measures to ensure the safety of the President-elect, the Vice President-elect, and all those attending the inauguration," said a Secret Service spokesperson.

The security measures for Biden's inauguration are the most extensive in history, reflecting the heightened concerns about potential violence and the need to ensure a peaceful transition of power.
