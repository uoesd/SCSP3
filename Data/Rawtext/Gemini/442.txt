Global Citizen Live: Prince Harry and Meghan Join Call for Vaccine Equity

New York, NY - Global Citizen, the international advocacy organization dedicated to ending extreme poverty, today announced that Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will join the Global Citizen Live event in New York City's Central Park on September 25th. The event is part of a 24-hour global broadcast aiming to promote global vaccine equity to combat COVID-19.

The Global Citizen Live campaign calls on G7 countries and the European Union to share 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses and waive vaccine intellectual property rights. The campaign also urges Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna to share mRNA technology with the WHO-backed hub in South Africa.

Prince Harry and Meghan have been vocal advocates for vaccine equity, previously co-chairing the VAX LIVE event and writing an open letter to Big Pharma about the issue. They also led a fundraising effort for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, raising $3.5 million for COVAX to distribute vaccines to low-income countries.

"We must look beyond ourselves with empathy and compassion for those who continue to suffer, and those whose lives have been cut short by the inequitable distribution of vaccines," said Prince Harry. "Every single person on this planet has the fundamental right to get vaccinated and to have access to healthcare."

The Global Citizen Live event will also feature appearances by health and global leaders, activists, and artists to promote environmental protection and poverty defeat. The initiative addresses the ongoing issue of vaccine equity amid the spread of coronavirus variants and vaccine hoarding by rich countries.

"We're thrilled to have Prince Harry and Meghan join us for Global Citizen Live," said Michael Sheldrick, Global Citizen's Chief Policy and Government Affairs Officer. "Their commitment to vaccine equity is inspiring, and we're grateful for their support in our efforts to end the pandemic and build a more just and equitable world."

The event aims to pressure wealthy nations on climate change commitment, promote emissions reduction by businesses, and tackle global hunger with a $6 billion contribution.

"Global Citizen Live is a powerful platform to amplify the voices of those who are most affected by poverty and injustice," said Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex. "We're proud to join Global Citizen in calling on world leaders to take urgent action to end the pandemic and build a better future for all."

The Global Citizen Live event will be broadcast live on ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX, MSNBC, and YouTube on September 25th. For more information, visit www.globalcitizen.org.
