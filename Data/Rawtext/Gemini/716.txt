Teen Arrested for Bringing Gun to School Day After Deadly Shooting

Southfield, MI - A 17-year-old boy was arrested on Wednesday for bringing a handgun to Southfield Regional Academic Campus in the Detroit area, just one day after a deadly school shooting at Oxford High School several miles away.

The arrest was made after the school principal received a tip from a student about a possible gun on campus. The principal immediately alerted a school resource officer, who located and arrested the suspect.

"We received a call from the principal that there was a student possibly carrying a gun," said Southfield Police Chief Elvin Barren. "The school resource officer responded and located the student."

A purple Bersa Thunder .380-caliber gun with a magazine containing three bullets was found in the student's coat pocket. Chief Barren stated that the student had likely been carrying the weapon for several weeks.

"The student admitted to having the gun for a few weeks," said Chief Barren. "He said he found it and had no rounds loaded in the chamber."

Authorities do not believe the incident was a copycat of the Oxford High School shooting, where four students were killed. However, Chief Barren commended the student who reported the gun to the principal for his courageous action.

"I want to commend the student who came forward with the information," said Chief Barren. "He did the right thing, and he helped us prevent a potential tragedy."

The gun will be examined to see if it has been used in any crimes, and the prosecutor's office will decide on charging the teen.

Chief Barren warned of the false sense of power guns can give to individuals, leading to potential violence over disagreements.

"Guns give people a false sense of power," said Chief Barren. "They think they can solve their problems with a gun, but it often leads to violence."

The arrest comes amid heightened concerns about school safety following the Oxford High School shooting. Chief Barren urged parents to talk to their children about the dangers of guns and to report any suspicious activity to authorities.

"We need parents to talk to their kids about guns," said Chief Barren. "We need them to know that guns are dangerous and that they should never bring them to school."
