Prince Harry Reveals Meghan's Heartbreaking Reaction to Bullying Allegations

In his highly anticipated docuseries, "The Me You Can't See," Prince Harry has shed light on the profound impact that bullying allegations had on his wife, Meghan Markle, leading up to their bombshell Oprah interview.

The Bullying Allegations

In March 2021, The Times reported that Meghan faced a bullying complaint from a close adviser during her time as a working royal. The Duchess of Sussex vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation."

Meghan's Distress

In the docuseries, Harry described the devastating toll the allegations took on Meghan. "She was devastated," he said. "She was crying inconsolably. She was really, really struggling."

The media's relentless coverage of the allegations compounded Meghan's distress. "The smear campaign that was orchestrated against her was unbelievable," Harry said. "It was relentless, it was targeted, and it was vicious."

The Impact on Their Relationship

The bullying allegations put a significant strain on Harry and Meghan's relationship. "It created a lot of division between us," Harry admitted. "We were constantly having to defend ourselves against these attacks."

Therapy's Transformative Power

Amidst the turmoil, Harry credits therapy with helping him and Meghan navigate the challenges they faced. "Therapy has been a huge part of my life," he said. "It's helped me understand myself better, it's helped me understand my childhood better."

Meghan encouraged Harry to seek therapy, recognizing its potential to help him address unresolved issues from his past. "She was the one who said, 'You need to go to therapy,'" Harry said. "And I was like, 'I don't need to go to therapy.'"

The Importance of Mental Health

Harry emphasized the crucial importance of mental health and the transformative power of therapy. "Therapy has enabled me to handle anything," he said. "It's given me the tools to be able to deal with whatever life throws at me."

A New Chapter

Having resigned as working royals in March 2020, Harry and Meghan now reside in Montecito, California with their son Archie. They are expecting their second child, a girl, and have ventured into business with Netflix and Spotify, as well as their Archewell Foundation.

A Third Wedding Anniversary

On May 19, 2021, Harry and Meghan celebrated their third wedding anniversary. A spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said, "They are incredibly grateful for the love and support they have received from their family, friends, and the public."
