College Students and Retirees May Qualify for Stimulus Checks on 2020 Tax Returns

College-age Americans and adult dependents who were not eligible for stimulus checks in 2020 may receive up to $1,800 when they file their 2020 tax returns. This is because the Recovery Rebate Credit, which combines both rounds of stimulus payments into one credit, is available to individuals who meet certain income requirements and have a Social Security number.

Eligibility for Stimulus Checks

To qualify for stimulus checks, individuals must meet the following criteria:

  • Have a Social Security number
  • Meet income limits
  • Not be claimed as a dependent for 2020
  • File a 2020 tax return

Adult Dependents Excluded from Stimulus Checks

Adult dependents, including college students and retirees, were originally excluded from receiving stimulus checks. This was because they were claimed as dependents on someone else's tax return. However, the Recovery Rebate Credit allows these individuals to claim the stimulus money they missed out on.

Claiming Stimulus Money on Tax Returns

To claim stimulus money on tax returns, individuals must report the amount of stimulus they received. This information can be found on IRS Letter 6475, which was mailed to recipients of stimulus payments. If an individual did not receive a stimulus payment or received less than the full amount, they can claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their tax return.

No Repayment Required

There is no provision requiring repayment of stimulus money if an individual's 2020 income disqualifies them from receiving the payment. The IRS has stated that individuals who received stimulus payments but later determined they were ineligible do not need to repay the funds.

Filing Deadline

The deadline to file 2020 tax returns is April 15, 2021. However, individuals can request an extension to file their taxes by October 15, 2021.

Using Tax Software

Online tax software can simplify the process of claiming the Recovery Rebate Credit. These programs can guide individuals through the tax filing process and ensure that they claim all eligible credits and deductions.

Conclusion

College students and adult dependents who missed out on stimulus checks in 2020 may be eligible to receive up to $1,800 when they file their 2020 tax returns. By claiming the Recovery Rebate Credit, these individuals can ensure that they receive the financial assistance they are entitled to.
