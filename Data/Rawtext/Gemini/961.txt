Trump's Second Impeachment Trial: A Marathon of Words

The second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump was a marathon of words, with over 27 hours of proceedings and more than 140,000 words in the record.

An analysis by The Washington Post shows that House impeachment managers spoke over 91,000 words, while Trump's legal team contributed almost 33,000 words.

"The House managers presented a powerful case that Donald Trump incited an insurrection against the United States government," said Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), the lead impeachment manager. "We proved our case beyond a reasonable doubt."

Unlike Trump's first impeachment trial, the speaking time in the second trial was more evenly distributed among speakers. Raskin spoke just over 26,000 words, followed by Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.) with over 17,000 words and Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) with over 15,000 words.

"We wanted to make sure that every member of the House had an opportunity to speak," said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who was the lead impeachment manager during Trump's first trial. "This was a bipartisan effort, and we wanted to reflect that in our presentation."

Trump's defense team used only one-third of the time compared to the House managers during opening arguments. David Schoen, one of Trump's lawyers, said that the team "presented a concise and effective defense."

"We believe that the evidence presented by the House managers was insufficient to prove that President Trump incited an insurrection," Schoen said.

Both sides relied heavily on video presentations during their opening arguments. The House managers showed videos of the January 6 attack on the Capitol, while Trump's lawyers showed videos of Democrats making inflammatory statements.

"The videos were essential to our case," said Cicilline. "They showed the world what happened on January 6th, and they helped to prove that President Trump was responsible for inciting the violence."

Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke 1,256 words, primarily on procedural motions. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) also contributed significantly to the word count, with Leahy presiding over the trial.

"This was a historic trial," said Leahy. "The Senate has a duty to hold presidents accountable for their actions, and we took that duty seriously."

The House managers' strategy focused on presenting evidence of Trump's actions leading up to and on January 6th. They played videos, presented testimonials, and showed audio footage of Trump's speech at the rally that preceded the attack on the Capitol.

"We believe that we presented a compelling case that President Trump incited an insurrection," said Neguse. "We hope that the Senate will vote to convict him and hold him accountable for his actions."

Trump's defense team argued that the House managers failed to prove that Trump incited an insurrection. They also argued that the trial was unconstitutional because Trump was no longer in office.

"The House managers did not meet their burden of proof," said Bruce L. Castor Jr., another of Trump's lawyers. "The evidence they presented was insufficient to prove that President Trump incited an insurrection."

The Senate ultimately voted to acquit Trump, with 57 senators voting not guilty and 43 voting guilty.
