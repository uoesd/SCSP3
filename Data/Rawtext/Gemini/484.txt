Hurricane Ida's Deadly Toll Rises to 25 in New Jersey, Becoming State's Deadliest Storm Since Sandy

Hurricane Ida has left a devastating mark on New Jersey, claiming the lives of 25 people and leaving six others missing, Governor Phil Murphy announced on Friday. The storm's wrath has made it one of the deadliest in the state's history, surpassing the toll of Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

"This is a tragic day for New Jersey," Governor Murphy said. "Our hearts go out to the families who have lost loved ones."

The majority of the fatalities occurred when victims became trapped in vehicles overtaken by floodwaters, particularly in Central New Jersey. The relentless downpour and tornadoes spawned by Ida caused widespread damage, surpassing the impact of previous storms like Sandy and Irene.

"We have never seen anything like this before," said Governor Murphy. "The intensity of the rain and the tornadoes was unprecedented."

Ida's deadly path has extended beyond New Jersey, with at least 45 fatalities reported nationwide, concentrated in New Jersey and New York. The storm's remnants continue to wreak havoc, bringing heavy rainfall and flooding to other parts of the country.

Governor Murphy and other Democrats have attributed the increasing frequency and intensity of storms to climate change. New Jersey's geographic location and dense population make it particularly vulnerable to such natural disasters.

"We need to take action now to address climate change," said Governor Murphy. "We need to invest in our infrastructure and make our communities more resilient."

The White House has approved New Jersey's disaster declaration, enabling the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist with the emergency response. FEMA teams are already on the ground, providing aid to affected communities.

"We are grateful for the support of the federal government," said Governor Murphy. "We will work together to rebuild our state and make it stronger than ever before."

As the recovery efforts continue, Governor Murphy urged residents to remain vigilant and follow the instructions of local officials. He also emphasized the importance of community support during this difficult time.

"We will get through this together," said Governor Murphy. "We are New Jersey strong."
