WHO Approves Sinopharm COVID-19 Vaccine for Emergency Use

Geneva, Switzerland, May 7, 2021 - The World Health Organization (WHO) has granted Emergency Use Listing (EUL) to the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine, produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, a subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG). This decision follows a thorough assessment of the vaccine's safety, efficacy, and quality.

"This is an important milestone in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic," said Dr Mariângela Simão, Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products at WHO. "The Sinopharm vaccine is safe, effective, and will help protect people from this deadly virus."

The WHO's EUL procedure assesses novel health products during emergencies, focusing on safety, efficacy, and quality. The Sinopharm vaccine's assessment included on-site inspections of the production facility.

The Sinopharm vaccine is suitable for adults 18 years and older, with a two-dose schedule. No upper age limit is recommended for the vaccine, as it is likely to be effective in older adults. However, WHO recommends monitoring safety and effectiveness in older age groups using the vaccine.

The WHO urges Sinopharm to participate in the COVAX Facility, a global initiative to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. COVAX aims to deliver at least 2 billion doses of vaccines by the end of 2021, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries.

"We urge Sinopharm to participate in COVAX to ensure that this vaccine is available to all who need it," said Dr Simão. "No one should be left behind in the fight against this pandemic."

The Sinopharm vaccine is the fifth COVID-19 vaccine to receive EUL from WHO. Other vaccines listed for emergency use include Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Janssen, and Moderna.

About the Sinopharm COVID-19 Vaccine

The Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine is an inactivated vaccine, which means that it contains a weakened form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Inactivated vaccines are generally safe and effective, and have been used for many years to protect against other diseases such as polio and measles.

The Sinopharm vaccine has been shown to be 79% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and 100% effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization. The vaccine is also well-tolerated, with the most common side effects being pain at the injection site, headache, and fatigue.
