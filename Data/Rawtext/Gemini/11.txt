Lady Gaga's Inaugural Schiaparelli Dress: A Symbol of Peace and Italian Heritage

Lady Gaga's iconic Schiaparelli Haute Couture dress, worn at President Joe Biden's inauguration, has been hailed as one of her most memorable outfits. In a recent British Vogue video, the multihyphenate star revealed that the dress holds a special place in her heart. "It's one of my favorite outfits I've ever worn," Gaga said.

The Schiaparelli dress, designed by Daniel Roseberry, was not only visually stunning but also practical. "It was bulletproof," Gaga revealed. "I don't know if that was intentional or not, but it felt appropriate." The choice of Schiaparelli, an Italian designer, was a personal one for Gaga, who is of Italian-American heritage. "It was a love letter to America," Roseberry said. "It was a celebration of Gaga's artistry and her Italian heritage."

The dress featured a giant gilded brooch in the shape of a dove, symbolizing peace. "The dove is a symbol of peace and unity," Gaga said. "It was a message of hope and healing for the country."

Before the inauguration, Gaga wore a white Givenchy cape that fans likened to Princess Leia. For her singing performance, she opted for a fitted navy cashmere jacket and a voluminous washed red silk faille skirt. Her hair was styled in a braid, similar to the previous day, but accented with a red flower.

Roseberry, who is American, ties the French brand Schiaparelli back to the U.S. with his background. "I'm an American designing for a French house," Roseberry said. "I think that's a really interesting perspective to bring to the brand."
