FDA Authorizes Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Ages 5-11

Washington, D.C. – October 29, 2021 – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 in children 5 through 11 years of age. The vaccine's effectiveness was found to be 90.7% in preventing COVID-19 in the age group.

"Today's action follows a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data, which included clinical trials involving thousands of children," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. "The FDA's decision was based on a thorough review of the safety and effectiveness data, and we believe that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks for children in this age group."

"We are committed to ensuring the safety and effectiveness of all vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccines," said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "We have taken the time to carefully review all of the available data, and we believe that this vaccine is safe and effective for children ages 5-11."

The vaccine for this age group is administered as a two-dose series with a lower dose than that for ages 12 and up. The doses are given 21 days apart. The vaccine is not yet authorized for children under 5 years of age.

The FDA's authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children ages 5-11 is based on data from a clinical trial involving approximately 3,100 children in this age group. The trial found that the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children ages 5-11. The vaccine was also found to be safe, with no serious side effects detected.

The most common side effects of the vaccine in children ages 5-11 were pain at the injection site, redness, and swelling. Other side effects included fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, and fever. These side effects were generally mild and resolved within a few days.

The FDA's authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children ages 5-11 is a significant step in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The vaccine is safe and effective, and it will help protect children from this serious virus.

The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will meet next week to discuss further recommendations for the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in children ages 5-11. The ACIP's recommendations will be based on a review of the FDA's authorization and other available data.

The FDA and CDC have systems in place for continual safety monitoring of the COVID-19 vaccine. These systems will help to ensure that the vaccine continues to be safe and effective for children ages 5-11.
