GOP Purge: Cheney Ousted, Impeachment Voters Face Backlash

CNN – House Republicans have ousted Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming from her leadership post as conference chair due to her unwavering stance against former President Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 election. Cheney's removal marks a significant escalation in the GOP's internal divisions and its embrace of conspiracy theories.

The other nine House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump have also faced backlash, including censure and primary challenges. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, one of the most vocal critics of the GOP's embrace of Trumpism, has condemned the party's move to remove Cheney and has supported the other nine Republicans facing primary challenges.

"This is a party that is now embracing conspiracy theories and rejecting the rule of law," Kinzinger said. "We have to stand up to this and fight for the soul of the Republican Party."

Kinzinger has launched a political action committee called "Country First" to counter the GOP's embrace of conspiracy theories and to support candidates who believe in the rule of law.

Rep. John Katko of New York, who faced criticism from local GOP leaders for his impeachment vote, stood by his decision. "I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, and I believe that President Trump's actions on January 6th were a clear violation of that oath," Katko said.

Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan was censured by local Republican parties for his impeachment vote. "I understand that some people may disagree with my decision, but I believe that I did the right thing," Upton said.

Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington was condemned by the state's Republican Central Committee for her impeachment vote. "I voted my conscience, and I stand by my decision," Beutler said.

Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington does not regret his impeachment vote despite backlash from Trump supporters. "I believe that President Trump's actions on January 6th were a threat to our democracy, and I stand by my decision to hold him accountable," Newhouse said.

Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan expressed concerns over the future of the GOP and the influence of conspiracy theories. "The Republican Party is at a crossroads," Meijer said. "We can either embrace the rule of law and the principles that have made this country great, or we can continue down the path of conspiracy theories and division."

Meijer has been censured by GOP county groups and faces a primary challenge from Tom Norton, a Trump supporter who has echoed the former president's false claims about the election.

The GOP's purge of Cheney and the backlash against the other nine impeachment voters highlights the deep divisions within the party and the growing influence of Trumpism. It remains to be seen whether the party can overcome these divisions and return to its traditional principles or whether it will continue to embrace conspiracy theories and authoritarianism.
