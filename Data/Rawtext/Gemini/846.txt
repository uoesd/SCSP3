Tiger Woods Returns Home After Gruesome Car Crash, Focuses on Recovery

After spending nearly three weeks in the hospital following a devastating car crash in California, golf legend Tiger Woods has finally returned home to Florida to focus on his recovery.

The 45-year-old underwent emergency surgery for "significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity" after his SUV sheared through a tree and landed in the brush with major damage on the morning of February 23.

"I am so grateful to be home and continuing my recovery," Woods said in a statement. "I am also grateful for the overwhelming support and encouragement I've received throughout this ordeal."

Woods' injuries were severe, but he is in good spirits and focused on rehabilitation. He expressed happiness at being reunited with his children, Charlie Axel and Sam Alexis.

"It's been a tough few weeks, but I'm making progress," Woods said. "I'm still in some pain, but I'm working hard to get back to 100%."

Woods thanked the medical teams at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for their exceptional care.

"I'm so grateful to the doctors and nurses who have taken such good care of me," Woods said. "I wouldn't be where I am today without their help."

The crash occurred on the morning of February 23, when Woods' car veered off the road and struck a tree. Investigators have not found evidence that Woods attempted to prevent the crash.

A witness noticed Woods was unconscious immediately following the crash. Woods had no recollection of driving or how the accident happened.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is still investigating the crash, but no charges have been filed.

Woods' return home marks a significant milestone in his recovery. He is expected to undergo extensive rehabilitation in the coming months.

Woods' fans and the golf world are eagerly awaiting his return to the sport. He has not played competitively since the Masters in November 2020.

Woods has won 15 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus' 18. He is widely considered one of the greatest golfers of all time.

Woods' return to health and golf will be a welcome sight for fans around the world.
