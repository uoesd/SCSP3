UK Warns Taliban: Afghanistan Must Not Be Terror Haven

LONDON, Aug 17 – Britain has warned the Taliban that Afghanistan must not be used as a base for terror attacks against the West, as concerns grow about a foothold for militants from al Qaeda and Islamic State following the group's return to power.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would need to be "pragmatic" with the Taliban and try to influence them towards inclusivity, but emphasized that diplomatic and economic sanctions would be used to exercise leverage.

"We've got to be pragmatic and recognize that the Taliban are in control of the country," Raab told Sky News. "We've got to deal with them, but we're not going to recognize them. We're not going to legitimize them."

Despite describing the Taliban as a "red tag bunch of thugs," Raab acknowledged the need to engage with them in power. "We've got to test them and see whether we can moderate them," he said.

Raab stressed the importance of stability at Kabul airport, which has been the scene of chaos and violence since the Taliban seized control of the Afghan capital. "The airport is stabilizing," he said. "We've got to make sure that it remains stable and that we can continue to process people."

The Foreign Secretary said he currently saw no possibility of sitting down with the Taliban but did not rule out dialogue in the future. "We're not going to be able to do that at the moment," he said. "But we've got to keep the channels open."

Meanwhile, Prince Harry, who served in Afghanistan and founded the Invictus Games, has encouraged veterans to support each other in light of the situation.

"The Invictus community is a reminder of the resilience and determination of those who have served their countries," Prince Harry said in a statement. "The situation in Afghanistan is a reminder of the sacrifices they have made."

The Prince highlighted the impact of the conflict on the Invictus community, which brings together wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women from around the world. "Many of our members have served in Afghanistan, and they will be deeply affected by what is happening," he said.

"We must ensure that they have the support they need," Prince Harry added. "We must never forget the sacrifices they have made."
