Suez Canal Crisis: 200,000 Live Animals Face Death, EU Law Flouted

Brussels - An estimated 200,000 live animals are trapped in the Suez Canal, facing imminent death due to the blockage caused by the cargo vessel 'Ever Given.' The situation has been described as the worst maritime animal welfare tragedy in history.

Gabrile Păun, the EU director for Animals International, said, "This is an unprecedented disaster for animal welfare. These animals are suffering terribly, and many will likely die."

The animals, primarily sheep and cattle, are running out of feed and water. Approximately 130,000 of them originated from Romania. EU law mandates that ships carrying live animals have 25% more food than planned, but this rule is often not followed.

The Romanian authority ANSVSA claims there is enough food and water for a few days, but live animal exports have been suspended. However, Păun criticized the lack of transparency and regulation, noting that mortality rates on these ships are not reported due to EU legislation.

Romania has been criticized by the European Commission for its poor practices in live animal exports. In the past, Romania has failed to meet transport conditions, leading to thousands of animal deaths.

Păun suggested exporting meat rather than live animals as a more humane and profitable alternative. "Exporting processed meat would be more efficient, more profitable, and would spare animals from unnecessary suffering," he said.

Despite the recognition of benefits in exporting processed meat, Romania continues live animal exports.

Animal Welfare Concerns

The animals trapped in the Suez Canal are facing a number of welfare concerns, including:

  • Lack of food and water: The animals are running out of food and water, and many are already showing signs of dehydration and starvation.
  • Overcrowding: The animals are being held in overcrowded conditions, which can lead to stress, disease, and injury.
  • Heat stress: The animals are being exposed to high temperatures, which can lead to heat stress and death.
  • Disease: The animals are at risk of contracting diseases, which can spread quickly in overcrowded conditions.

EU Law and Regulation

EU law mandates that ships carrying live animals have 25% more food than planned. However, this rule is often not followed. Additionally, EU legislation does not require the reporting of mortality rates on live animal transport ships.

Păun criticized the lack of transparency and regulation, saying, "The EU must do more to protect animals during transport. We need stricter regulations and better enforcement."

Romania's Role

Romania is the largest exporter of live animals in the EU. The country has been criticized by the European Commission for its poor practices in live animal exports. In the past, Romania has failed to meet transport conditions, leading to thousands of animal deaths.

Păun suggested that Romania should switch to exporting processed meat instead of live animals. "Exporting processed meat would be more efficient, more profitable, and would spare animals from unnecessary suffering," he said.

Conclusion

The Suez Canal crisis is a major animal welfare disaster. An estimated 200,000 live animals are trapped in the canal, facing imminent death. The EU must take action to improve the regulation and enforcement of live animal transport laws. Romania, as the largest exporter of live animals in the EU, must also take steps to improve its practices.
