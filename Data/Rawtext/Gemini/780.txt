Tragic 'Rust' Shooting Echoes Wilmington's Film Set Safety Concerns

The fatal shooting on the set of the Western film "Rust" in New Mexico has sent shockwaves through the film industry, prompting comparisons to Wilmington's own tragic film set accidents, most notably the death of Brandon Lee on the set of "The Crow" in 1993.

Charlie Coleman, an on-set armorer with over 30 years of experience, expressed concern that safety on film sets is becoming compromised due to increased production demands and strict COVID-19 protocols.

"There's a lot of pressure to get things done quickly and cheaply," Coleman said. "And with COVID, there's a lot of extra protocols that make it difficult to maintain a safe set."

Following the "Rust" incident, some film productions are reassessing the use of real guns on set. Coleman's current projects are opting for "silent blanks" instead, which create the illusion of gunfire without the use of live ammunition.

"It's not perfect, but it's a lot safer," Coleman said.

There's a debate over the necessity of real guns on set, with some advocating for the use of CGI and technology to replace them for safety. However, Coleman emphasizes that while firearms themselves can be managed safely, the human element introduces challenges to maintaining safety.

"Guns are dangerous, and there's always the potential for something to go wrong," Coleman said. "But it's not just the guns. It's the people handling them."

Wilmington has seen improved set safety since the 1990s, with no major accidents reported in over 20 years. However, historical accidents in Wilmington serve as a reminder of the potential dangers involved in filmmaking.

In 1985, during the filming of "Maximum Overdrive," a stuntman was killed when a truck he was driving crashed into a parked car. In 1989, on the set of "Cyborg," an explosion injured several crew members, resulting in legal actions.

The "Crow" incident remains one of the most well-known on-set accidents. Brandon Lee, the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, was fatally shot during a scene where he was supposed to be shot with a blank cartridge. The gun was loaded with a live round, and Lee died from his injuries.

In 1998, an on-set explosion during the filming of "Black Dog" caused burn injuries to three people. A less severe incident occurred on the set of "Iron Man 3" in 2012, when Robert Downey Jr. broke his ankle, delaying production.

"Every accident is a tragedy," Coleman said. "And it's a reminder that we need to be constantly vigilant about safety on film sets."

Wilmington's film industry has taken steps to improve safety, including the establishment of the Wilmington Film Commission, which provides safety guidelines and training for film productions.

"We've learned a lot from the past," said Wilmington Film Commission Director Amy Fennell. "And we're committed to making sure that our sets are safe for everyone."

The "Rust" shooting has reignited the debate over film set safety, and it's likely to lead to new safety measures being implemented. However, as Coleman points out, the human element will always be a factor in film set safety.

"We can have all the safety protocols in place," Coleman said. "But if someone makes a mistake, it can have tragic consequences."
