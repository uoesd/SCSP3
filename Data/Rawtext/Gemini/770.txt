AFI Honors Halyna Hutchins with Scholarship Fund for Women Cinematographers

In memory of the late cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, the American Film Institute (AFI) has established a scholarship fund to support women cinematographers. Hutchins, who tragically died after being shot by a prop gun containing a live round on the set of "Rust," was a rising star in the film industry.

Olia Oparina, a close friend and collaborator of Hutchins, shared their journey and the impact Hutchins had on the film industry. "Halyna was a force of nature," Oparina said. "She was passionate, talented, and always pushing boundaries."

The scholarship fund aims to support female cinematographers in building sustainable careers. Hutchins and Oparina, both immigrants, built their careers from scratch in Hollywood, forming a supportive "tribe" along the way.

"We were all immigrants, we were all women, and we were all trying to make it in Hollywood," Oparina said. "Halyna was always there to support us, to give us advice, and to help us get our foot in the door."

Hutchins was known for her passion, craftsmanship, and advocacy for women in cinematography and directing. Before her death, she was gaining recognition with offers for big-budget films like "Archenemy" and "Blindfire."

"Halyna was a true artist," Oparina said. "She had a unique vision and a gift for capturing the beauty of the world."

AFI is now accepting donations to the scholarship fund. The fund will provide financial support to female cinematographers who are enrolled in AFI's Conservatory program.

Hutchins, born in Ukraine, graduated from UCLA's Professional Producing program and the AFI Conservatory. Her unexpected death at age 42 has deeply affected her family, friends, and the broader film industry.

"Halyna's legacy will live on through the women cinematographers who benefit from this scholarship," Oparina said. "She would be so proud to know that her memory is being honored in this way."
