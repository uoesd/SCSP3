Vaccine Efficacy: A Single Dose May Not Guarantee Immunity

As the global vaccination campaign against COVID-19 continues, the question of how effective a single dose is remains a subject of ongoing research and debate. While early results have provided some encouraging signs, experts caution against complacency and emphasize the need for further data and continued vigilance.

Pfizer's Estimate Under Scrutiny

One of the most widely discussed vaccines is Pfizer-BioNTech's mRNA vaccine, which has shown promising efficacy in clinical trials. However, the company's estimate of 52% effectiveness after a single dose has come under fire from some experts.

Professor Nachman Ash, who coordinated Israel's COVID-19 response, criticized Pfizer's figure, stating that "the data is not strong enough to say that one dose is 52% effective." He added that the estimate was based on a small number of cases and that more research was needed.

Israeli Study Raises Questions

An Israeli study published in the journal "Nature Medicine" found that the Pfizer vaccine was only 33% effective in preventing infection after a single dose. This result differs significantly from Pfizer's own estimate and has raised questions about the real-world effectiveness of the vaccine.

The study, conducted by Clalit Health Services, looked at data from over 2 million people who had received the Pfizer vaccine. It found that the vaccine was highly effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization, but its ability to prevent infection was more limited.

Altmann: Don't Assume Immunity After 14 Days

Professor Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, cautioned against considering oneself safe 14 days after receiving the first dose of any vaccine. He emphasized that early signs of efficacy are not definitive proof of immunity.

"We need to be very careful about assuming that because you've had one dose, you're immune," Altmann said. "We don't know yet how long immunity lasts, and we don't know how effective a single dose is against different variants of the virus."

Oxford-AstraZeneca: Varying Effectiveness

The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has also shown varying degrees of effectiveness after a single dose. A study published in "The Lancet" found that the vaccine was 64.1% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 after one dose. However, the effectiveness varied depending on the dosing strategy used.

A separate phase III trial conducted by AstraZeneca found that the vaccine was 70% effective against mild or moderate illness after one dose. The study also suggested that the vaccine's protection could extend for several months before a booster dose is needed.

Moderna: 80.2% Efficacy Claim

Moderna has claimed that its mRNA vaccine is 80.2% effective after one dose, based on data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, there is currently no data on how long immunity lasts after a single dose of the Moderna vaccine.

Sinovac and Sinopharm: Limited Data

The Chinese vaccines CoronaVac (Sinovac) and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm) have shown varied efficacy in trials conducted in different countries. However, there is limited data on the effectiveness of a single dose of either vaccine.

CoronaVac has shown efficacy ranging from 50.4% to 83.5% in trials conducted in Turkey, Indonesia, and Brazil. However, none of these trials specifically examined the effectiveness of a single dose.

Sinopharm's BBIBP-CorV vaccine has been claimed to be 79% effective after two doses, but this claim has not been independently verified by international organizations. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has claimed that the Sinopharm vaccine is 86% effective, but no details on single dose protection have been released.

Conclusion

While the early results of COVID-19 vaccine trials have been encouraging, it is important to remember that more research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness and duration of immunity provided by a single dose. Experts emphasize the need for continued vigilance and adherence to public health measures, such as social distancing and mask-wearing, until more data is available.
