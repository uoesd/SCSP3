Third Stimulus Check of Up to $1,400 Expected as Part of $1.9 Trillion Covid Relief Package

Washington CNN – A third round of stimulus checks, worth up to $1,400 per person, is expected to be included in a $1.9 trillion Covid relief package that has been approved by the Senate and awaits President Joe Biden's signature after a final House vote.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed efforts to expedite the distribution of payments, saying, "We are working to get relief to the American people as fast as possible."

Approximately 90% of American households will be eligible for the payments, which will be based on either 2019 or 2020 tax returns, depending on which is most recent. Individuals earning under $75,000, and couples under $150,000, will receive the full amount, which gradually phases out for higher incomes. Those earning over $80,000 (individuals), $120,000 (heads of households), and $160,000 (couples) will not receive payments.

The eligibility criteria are slightly stricter than previous rounds, potentially excluding higher income earners who previously qualified. However, taxpayers whose financial situation changed in 2020 may adjust their eligibility by filing their tax return promptly.

The distribution of payments may be slightly delayed due to the ongoing tax filing season, but Psaki emphasized that "the President is committed to getting this relief out to the American people as quickly as possible."
