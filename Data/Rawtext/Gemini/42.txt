Supreme Court Justices Miss Biden Inauguration Amid Pandemic, Political Tensions

In a break from tradition, only six Supreme Court Justices attended President Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday, marking the first absence of some justices in over 20 years.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito Jr. did not attend the ceremony due to public health concerns amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, according to Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg.

"The Justices who did not attend the inauguration did so based on their own assessment of the risks and benefits of attending," Arberg said in a statement.

The Supreme Court has been operating remotely since March, only gathering in person once for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's memorial service in September.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. administered the presidential oath to Biden, despite both having opposed Roberts' confirmation in the past. Roberts was confirmed by a 78-22 vote in 2005, with Biden and then-Senator Kamala Harris voting against his nomination.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President Harris, marking a series of firsts for both officials. Sotomayor is the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice, while Harris is the first woman, the first Black person, and the first South Asian American to serve as Vice President.

Biden and Harris have historically voted against the confirmation of six out of the nine current Supreme Court justices. In addition to Roberts, they opposed the confirmations of Justices Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.

Biden's attempts to filibuster Alito's nomination in 2006 and his role in Clarence Thomas's contentious confirmation hearing in 1991 reflect a history of tension between the President and some of the justices.

Thomas has publicly criticized Biden's conduct during his confirmation hearings, particularly concerning questions about natural law.

"I think it was a very unfair hearing," Thomas said in a 2019 interview. "I think it was a very unfair process."

Despite past confrontations, Biden reached out to Anita Hill, who accused Thomas of sexual harassment, to express regret for her treatment during the hearings.

"I am sorry for what happened to you," Biden told Hill in a 2019 phone call. "I am sorry that you were treated the way you were treated."

The absence of some justices at the inauguration hints at enduring political and personal tensions. The Supreme Court has become increasingly polarized in recent years, with the conservative justices often siding with one another and the liberal justices dissenting.

The Court is currently considering several high-profile cases, including challenges to the Affordable Care Act and the Voting Rights Act. The outcome of these cases could have a significant impact on American society.

The absence of some justices at the inauguration is a reminder of the political and personal dynamics that shape the Supreme Court. The justices are not immune to the same partisan divisions that exist in the rest of the country.

As the Court continues to grapple with some of the most pressing issues facing the nation, it remains to be seen how these tensions will affect its decisions.
