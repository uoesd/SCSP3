Oxford Shooting Survivor Phoebe Arthur Returns Home After Hospital Release

Oxford High School shooting survivor Phoebe Arthur, 14, has been released from Hurley Medical Center after making significant progress in her recovery. Phoebe was shot in the chest and neck during the November 30 shooting that tragically claimed the lives of four students and injured seven others.

"It's a miracle that she's alive," said Sandy Cunningham, Phoebe's mother. "We're so grateful to the doctors and nurses who saved her life."

Phoebe's family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover trauma-related expenses. The page has raised approximately $75,258 of a $100,000 goal.

"The support we've received from the community has been overwhelming," said Naomi Ernest, Phoebe's cousin and the organizer of the GoFundMe page. "It's a testament to the love and compassion that people have for our family."

Phoebe's recovery has been remarkable. She is now able to sit up, walk, and even take laps around the pediatric unit.

"She's a fighter," said Cunningham. "She's determined to get better and get back to her life."

The GoFundMe campaign has received donations and messages of support from across the country.

"We're so grateful for the generosity of people who have donated to Phoebe's GoFundMe page," said Ernest. "It's going to make a huge difference in her recovery."

A total of eight verified GoFundMe pages have been set up in relation to the Oxford shooting, including one for another survivor, Aiden Watson.

Aiden's GoFundMe page highlights the start of his recovery journey and the missed opportunity to join the high school swim team due to the shooting.

Another survivor, Eli Mueller, had a GoFundMe page detailing his medical challenges and recovery process, raising about $75,177.

Philanthropist Bill Pulte has urged his 3.2 million followers to support the GoFundMe pages benefitting Oxford families.

"These families are going through a lot right now," said Pulte. "We need to show them that we care and that we're here to help."

GoFundMe has verified accounts for the Oxford shooting victims and community, providing a platform for financial support and recovery.

"We're committed to helping the Oxford community heal and rebuild," said GoFundMe spokesperson Rachel Hollis. "We're here to support the victims and their families in any way we can."

The outpouring of support for the Oxford shooting survivors is a testament to the resilience and compassion of the community. As these young people continue their recovery, they will be surrounded by love and support from those who care about them.
