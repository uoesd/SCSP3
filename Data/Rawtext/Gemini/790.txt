IRS Distributes Over 163 Million Third Stimulus Payments, Including 'Plus-Up' Adjustments

Washington, D.C. - The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced the distribution of over 163 million third stimulus payments, including recent 'plus-up payments,' under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

The third round of stimulus checks, authorized by President Joe Biden in March, provides individuals and families with up to $1,400 per qualifying member, including adult and child dependents. The payments are intended to provide financial relief to Americans struggling amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Eligibility and Income Limits

Eligibility for the stimulus payments is based on the most recent tax return on file with the IRS, either from 2019 or 2020. Individuals with adjusted gross incomes (AGIs) below $75,000 for single filers, $150,000 for married couples filing jointly, and $112,500 for heads of household will receive the full $1,400 payment.

For AGIs above these thresholds, the payments phase out gradually. The payments completely phase out at $80,000 for single taxpayers, $160,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly, and $120,000 for heads of household.

Adult Dependents

Adult dependents, including college students and disabled adults, are eligible for the full $1,400 payment, subject to the same income phaseouts as other individuals. This provision expands eligibility compared to previous stimulus payments.

'Plus-Up' Payments

The IRS is issuing 'plus-up payments' to individuals who qualify for a higher payment based on their 2020 tax returns. These payments are intended to correct any underpayments made based on the 2019 tax returns.

Distribution and Timeline

The IRS has been distributing the third stimulus payments in weekly batches since March 17. Payments are being made via direct deposit, mailed checks, and EIP cards. The IRS has not yet announced a specific end date for the distribution process.

No Indication of Fourth Stimulus Check

Currently, there is no indication from President Biden or the White House that a fourth stimulus check will be issued. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 authorized the third round of payments, and there are no plans for additional legislation at this time.

Economic Impact

The third stimulus payments are expected to have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. The payments are intended to provide immediate financial relief to individuals and families, boost consumer spending, and stimulate economic growth.
