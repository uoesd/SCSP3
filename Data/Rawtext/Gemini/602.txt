Biden-Harris Administration Invests $1.5 Billion to Strengthen and Diversify Health Care Workforce

Washington, D.C. – Today, Vice President Kamala Harris announced a $1.5 billion investment to grow and diversify the U.S. health care workforce, addressing critical shortages and advancing health equity.

"This investment will help ensure that all Americans have access to the high-quality health care they deserve, no matter their race, ethnicity, or zip code," said Vice President Harris. "By supporting the next generation of health care professionals, we are building a more just and equitable health system for all."

The funding will support the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), Nurse Corps, and Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery programs. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, this initiative will support over 22,700 health care providers, including doctors, nurses, and behavioral health professionals.

More than 23.6 million patients in the U.S. receive care from clinicians within these programs, which provide essential services in underserved communities. The initiative aims to address racial and ethnic disparities in health care professions and outcomes, which contribute to health inequities.

"This investment is a critical step towards addressing the projected shortage of up to 60,000 primary care doctors, dentists, and psychiatrists over the next decade in the U.S.," said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. "By supporting the education and training of health care professionals, we are ensuring that all Americans have access to the care they need."

The federal government plans to award $330 million in additional funding for primary care education to help meet these needs. This funding will support programs that train primary care providers in underserved communities and increase the diversity of the health care workforce.

The investments are in line with recommendations from the Presidential COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, which called for addressing the systemic barriers that contribute to health disparities. This funding is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's broader efforts to center equity in the COVID-19 response.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the deep inequities in our health care system," said Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, Chair of the Presidential COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force. "This investment will help us build a more just and equitable health system that meets the needs of all Americans."

$785 million was announced earlier for equity-focused programs and initiatives as part of these efforts. These investments are a testament to the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to addressing health disparities and building a more equitable health care system for all.
