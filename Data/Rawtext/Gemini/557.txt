Kabul Airport Chaos: Seven Dead in Stampede as Afghans Flee Taliban

KABUL, Afghanistan – At least seven Afghans have died in a crush at Kabul's international airport amid attempts to flee the country following the Taliban takeover.

The deaths occurred in a panic as thousands tried to enter the airport, with reports of Taliban fighters firing into the air. Kabul's airport has become a chaotic exodus point after the Taliban's rapid acquisition of Afghanistan earlier this month.

"The situation at the airport is extremely challenging and unpredictable," said a NATO official. "We are doing everything we can to manage the crowds and ensure the safe evacuation of those who need it."

The Taliban have promised amnesty to former adversaries, but reports of retribution have fueled fears among the populace. Western troops have struggled to manage massive crowds at the airport, leading to health and safety emergencies.

"We are working around the clock to evacuate American citizens, Afghan partners, and other vulnerable Afghans," said U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. "We are committed to getting as many people out as possible."

U.S. and British forces have airlifted thousands of people out of Afghanistan, but the effort is still below capacity. The activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program aims to aid the evacuation of Afghan refugees.

"We are doing everything we can to get people out of Afghanistan as quickly and safely as possible," said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. "We are working with our allies and partners to coordinate this effort."

Concerns of potential attacks by Islamic State affiliates have necessitated heightened security measures for military aircraft.

"We are taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our troops and the people we are evacuating," said a NATO official.

Resistance against the Taliban is forming in parts of Afghanistan, with some regions pledging to defend against Taliban control.

"We will not give up our country to the Taliban," said Ahmad Massoud, the son of former Afghan resistance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud. "We will fight for our freedom."

The Taliban have condemned the resistance, calling it a "conspiracy" against the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

"We will not tolerate any attempts to undermine our authority," said Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem. "We will deal with any resistance with force."

Senior Taliban official Amir Khan Motaqi has urged Afghans to return home and participate in the rebuilding of the country.

"We want all Afghans to come back and help us build a new Afghanistan," said Motaqi. "We need everyone's help to create a peaceful and prosperous future for our country."

The situation in Afghanistan remains fluid and unpredictable. The Taliban have established control over most of the country, but resistance is growing in some areas. The evacuation of foreign nationals and Afghan refugees continues, but the process is facing challenges due to the large crowds and security concerns.
