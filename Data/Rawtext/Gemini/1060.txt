Laundrie Remains Missing as Search Enters Sixth Day, Indicted for Debit Card Fraud

NORTH PORT, Florida (WABC) – The search for Brian Laundrie, the sole person of interest in the death of Gabby Petito, entered its sixth day on Thursday, with authorities continuing to scour the Carlton Reserve in Florida where he told his parents he was going.

Laundrie, 23, was indicted on Wednesday by a federal grand jury for unauthorized use of a Capital One debit card and pin between Aug. 30 and Sep. 1, with intent to defraud. The indictment alleges that Laundrie used the card to make unauthorized withdrawals or purchases totaling more than $1,000.

"The indictment doesn't change our strategy in finding Brian Laundrie," said Commander Joseph Fussell, who is leading the search in Florida. "Our focus remains on locating him and bringing him into custody."

The search for Laundrie has been ongoing since Sep. 17, when he was reported missing by his parents. Authorities have been searching the Carlton Reserve, a 25,000-acre wilderness area, using drones, ATVs, and search dogs. Divers have also joined the search, focusing on bodies of water in the reserve.

"We're using every resource at our disposal to find Brian Laundrie," Fussell said. "We're confident that we will eventually locate him."

Meanwhile, Gabby Petito's funeral is scheduled for Sunday at Moloney's Holbrook Funeral Home in Holbrook, New York. The funeral will be open to the public and media.

Petito, 22, was reported missing on Sep. 11 after her family lost contact with her while she was on a cross-country road trip with Laundrie. Her body was later found in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, and her death was ruled a homicide.

The City of Moab, Utah, is also investigating the police handling of a domestic incident between Petito and Laundrie on Aug. 12. The incident was reported by a witness who saw the couple arguing outside a grocery store.

"We're conducting a thorough review of the incident to determine if our officers followed proper protocol," said Moab City Police Chief Bret Edge. "We're committed to transparency and accountability."

A witness, Nina Celie Angelo, also reported an explosive argument between Petito and Laundrie at a Wyoming restaurant on Aug. 27. Angelo said she heard Laundrie telling Petito to "shut the f--- up" and saw him grab her face.

"It was clear that he was controlling and abusive," Angelo said. "I'm heartbroken for Gabby."

The Moab Police Department has released a witness statement describing a domestic dispute between Petito and Laundrie in August. The statement says that the couple was arguing about their relationship and that Laundrie was trying to leave.

"The witness stated that Laundrie was the primary aggressor in the incident," the statement says. "The witness also stated that Petito was crying and upset."

The search for Laundrie is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Authorities are urging anyone with information about his whereabouts to contact the FBI.
