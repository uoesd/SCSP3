Harris Embarks on Asia Trip to Promote 'America is Back' Message

Washington, D.C. - Vice President Kamala Harris will embark on a six-day trip to Singapore and Vietnam from August 20 to 26, marking her first visit to the region as vice president and her second international trip since taking office.

"This trip will underscore the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to comprehensive engagement and strategic partnerships in Asia," said Symone Sanders, Chief Spokesperson for the Vice President.

Harris's visit aims to convey the message that "America is back" and signal the administration's interest in the region. She will emphasize the importance of trade, security, and economic cooperation.

In Singapore, Harris will meet with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and other government officials to discuss regional security, the Covid-19 pandemic, and climate change. She will also participate in a roundtable with business leaders and deliver a speech on the U.S.-Singapore relationship.

In Vietnam, Harris will become the first vice president ever to visit the country. She will meet with President Nguyen Xuan Phuc and other officials to discuss trade, security, and human rights. Harris will also visit a Covid-19 vaccination site and meet with civil society leaders.

The visit underscores the Biden Administration's effort to counter China's growing influence in the region through democratic partnerships. President Biden has not yet traveled to the region since taking office but has hosted leaders from Japan and South Korea.

Harris's trip will focus on strengthening relationships with key allies in Asia and promoting the administration's vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region. She will emphasize the importance of cooperation on issues such as trade, security, and climate change.

The vice president's visit is expected to reinforce the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to the region and its determination to work with partners to address common challenges. Harris's presence in Asia will demonstrate the administration's willingness to engage with the region and promote its interests.
