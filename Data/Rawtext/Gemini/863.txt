Tiger Woods Seriously Injured in Single-Car Crash

Los Angeles, California - Golf legend Tiger Woods was involved in a serious single-car crash near Los Angeles on Tuesday morning, resulting in emergency surgery on his right leg. The 45-year-old was driving alone when his vehicle veered off the road and rolled over several times.

Emergency Response and Medical Treatment

Woods was initially transported to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he underwent immediate surgery for a comminuted open fracture in his right leg. The severity of the injury required the insertion of a rod into his tibia and screws into his fibula.

"Mr. Woods suffered significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity that were treated during emergency surgery by our trauma team," said Dr. Anish Mahajan, Interim CEO and Chief Medical Officer of Harbor-UCLA.

After the initial surgery, Woods was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for continuing orthopedic care and recovery. His team confirmed that he is now in good spirits and recovering from follow-up procedures.

Crash Investigation and Liability

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is investigating the cause of the crash. Sheriff Alex Villanueva stated that Woods was not impaired or under the influence at the time of the accident.

"There was no evidence of impairment at the scene," Villanueva said. "We have no reason to believe that this is anything other than an accident."

The crash occurred on a stretch of road in Rolling Hills Estates, known for its slope and curves. The cities of Rolling Hills and Rancho Palos Verdes could potentially be liable for the accident if it is determined that the road conditions were unsafe.

Woods' Recovery and Future

Woods faces a lengthy recovery process from his injuries, which add to a history of physical health issues since 2008. The crash has raised concerns about his ability to continue his professional golf career.

"We don't know how long it will take for him to recover," said Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg. "We're just taking it day by day."

Crash Site and Vehicle Details

The crash site is located near the intersection of Hawthorne Boulevard and Blackhorse Road. Woods' vehicle, a Genesis GV80, crossed the center median and rolled over several times.

The Genesis GV80 is equipped with a "black box" that records data such as speed, acceleration, and braking. This data could provide valuable insights into the circumstances of the crash.

Woods' Activities Prior to Crash

On the day of the crash, Woods was headed to a video shoot with NFL quarterbacks Drew Brees and Justin Herbert. The shoot was part of a promotional campaign for the Genesis GV80.

Conclusion

Tiger Woods' single-car crash has sent shockwaves through the sports world and beyond. The extent of his injuries and the potential impact on his career remain uncertain. The investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing, and Woods faces a long road to recovery.
