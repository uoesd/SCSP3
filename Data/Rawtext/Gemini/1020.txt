El Paso's Winter Storm Resilience: A Tale of Preparation and Interconnection

While much of Texas grappled with widespread power outages and disruptions during a historic winter storm, El Paso emerged as an oasis of stability. The city's residents enjoyed uninterrupted utilities and fully stocked stores, a stark contrast to the chaos that engulfed other parts of the state.

"It was like a different world," said El Paso resident Robert Gomez. "I went to the grocery store, and it was fully stocked. The power was on. It was like nothing was happening."

El Paso's resilience can be attributed to several factors, including its preparation for winter storms following a devastating 2011 event. The city invested heavily in winterizing its infrastructure, including power plants and distribution lines. Additionally, El Paso's connection to the Western Interconnection grid, which spans 13 western states, allowed it to draw power from neighboring states during the storm.

"We have a very robust winterization program," said Steve Buraczyk, Senior Vice President of Operations at El Paso Electric. "We've spent millions of dollars over the years to make sure that our facilities are prepared for extreme weather events."

In contrast, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages about 90% of Texas's electric load, was unable to draw power from other states during the storm. This was due to ERCOT's isolation from the national grid and its lack of interconnections with neighboring states.

"ERCOT is an island," said Ramanan Krishnamoorti, Chief Energy Officer at the University of Houston. "It's not connected to the rest of the country, so it can't import power when it needs it."

El Paso Electric, on the other hand, has invested heavily in winterizing its facilities, including the construction of the Montana Power Station, which has dual-fuel capability and can switch between natural gas and diesel fuel.

"We've taken a very proactive approach to winterization," said Buraczyk. "We've spent millions of dollars on our facilities, and we've also developed a comprehensive winterization plan."

Many Texas power companies ignored voluntary winterization guidelines issued by ERCOT following the 2011 outages. This lack of preparation left them vulnerable to the extreme weather conditions that hit the state during the recent storm.

"The voluntary guidelines were not enough," said Carey King, Assistant Director at the University of Texas's Energy Institute. "We need mandatory winterization standards in Texas."

El Paso Electric's participation in the Western Interconnection incentivizes winterization for selling excess energy out-of-state. This creates a financial incentive for the company to invest in winterizing its facilities.

"The Western Interconnection provides us with a market for our excess energy," said Buraczyk. "This gives us an incentive to winterize our facilities so that we can sell our energy when it's needed."

Calls for mandatory winterization in Texas have risen in the wake of the recent storm, with responsibility falling on state legislators and agencies. Some experts believe that policy change is necessary to avoid future outages.

"We need to change the market rules in Texas," said Krishnamoorti. "We need to create incentives for power companies to winterize their facilities."

Others argue that altering market rules could have unintended consequences.

"We need to be careful about changing market rules," said King. "We don't want to create unintended consequences that could make the problem worse."

Despite El Paso's resilience, the widespread suffering in Texas highlights systemic failures in policy and planning. The state's reliance on a single grid operator, ERCOT, and the lack of mandatory winterization standards left millions of Texans without power and heat during a historic storm.

"The recent storm was a wake-up call for Texas," said King. "We need to take a hard look at our energy policies and make sure that we're prepared for future extreme weather events."
