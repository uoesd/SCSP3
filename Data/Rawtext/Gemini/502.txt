Human Remains Found in Stomach of Alligator Suspected in Louisiana Hurricane Attack

Sept 14 (Reuters) – Human remains were found in the stomach of a 504-pound alligator captured in Louisiana, ending a two-week search for a 71-year-old man believed to have been attacked by the reptile during Hurricane Ida.

The grim discovery was made after the alligator was caught by Louisiana Department of Wildlife licensed nuisance hunters near the home of Timothy Satterlee Sr. in Slidell, Louisiana. Satterlee was last seen checking storm damage outside his home the day after Hurricane Ida caused devastating flooding in the state.

"The alligator was captured and human remains were located inside the alligator," said Captain Lance Vitter, spokesperson for the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office. "We will be working with the coroner's office to verify the remains."

The attack occurred on August 30, the day after Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm. Satterlee's wife witnessed the alligator attack her husband, resulting in the loss of one of his arms. She sought help but found her husband missing upon return.

"We are heartbroken by this news," said Vitter. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the Satterlee family during this difficult time."

Wildlife agents spotted the alligator near the Satterlee home using a drone, leading to its capture. The alligator's size is unusual for the region, highlighting the severity of the attack.

"This is a very large alligator for this area," said Vitter. "It is a reminder of the dangers that can be present in our waterways, especially after a hurricane."

The incident has shocked the local community where Satterlee was known as a community pillar.

"Tim was a great guy," said neighbor John Smith. "He was always willing to help others. He will be deeply missed."

The St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office is investigating the incident. The alligator will be euthanized, and the human remains will be turned over to the coroner's office for identification.

"We are grateful to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife for their assistance in capturing this alligator," said Vitter. "We hope that this brings some closure to the Satterlee family."

The discovery of human remains in the alligator's stomach is a tragic reminder of the dangers posed by alligators, especially during and after hurricanes. Residents are urged to be aware of their surroundings and to take precautions when near waterways.
