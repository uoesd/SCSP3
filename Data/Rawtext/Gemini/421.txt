Waters' Call for 'Confrontation' in Chauvin Trial Sparks Outrage and Censure Resolution

Washington CNN – Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California) has ignited a firestorm of controversy with her call for protesters to "get more confrontational" if Derek Chauvin is acquitted in the murder of George Floyd.

Waters' Controversial Remarks

Speaking in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, where protests erupted over the police killing of Daunte Wright, Waters urged demonstrators to "stay on the street" and "get more confrontational" if Chauvin is not found guilty.

"We've got to stay on the street and we've got to get more active, we've got to get more confrontational," Waters said. "We've got to make sure that they know that we mean business."

Republican Backlash

Waters' comments drew immediate criticism from Republicans, who accused her of inciting violence.

"Maxine Waters is inciting violence in Minneapolis – just as she has incited it in the past," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). "This is dangerous and unacceptable."

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California) announced he is introducing a resolution to censure Waters for her "dangerous comments."

Waters' Clarification

Waters later clarified her remarks, stating that she was referring to nonviolent actions and speaking up for justice system reform.

"I'm not talking about violence," Waters said. "I'm talking about confrontation. I'm talking about civil disobedience. I'm talking about marching in the streets."

Judge's Concerns

Judge Peter Cahill, who is presiding over Chauvin's trial, expressed concern that Waters' comments could be grounds for an appeal.

"I'll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given us an issue that we'll have to deal with down the road," Cahill said.

Pelosi's Defense

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Waters, denying the need for an apology and dismissing claims that Waters incited violence.

"I don't think she was inciting violence," Pelosi said. "I think she was saying that people should be heard."

Hoyer's Concerns

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland) downplayed Waters' remarks but expressed concern over their potential impact on the trial's appeal.

"I don't think she was inciting violence," Hoyer said. "But I do think it's important for us to be mindful of the fact that this could have an impact on the trial."

GOP Double Standard

The controversy over Waters' comments stands in stark contrast to the GOP's response to the Capitol insurrection and previous statements by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia).

Greene has repeatedly made inflammatory and violent statements, including calling for the execution of Democrats. However, she has not faced any censure or significant criticism from her Republican colleagues.

Conclusion

Rep. Maxine Waters' call for protesters to "get more confrontational" in the Chauvin trial has sparked a heated debate about the role of protest and the limits of free speech. While Waters has clarified her remarks, the controversy is likely to continue as the trial progresses and the nation grapples with the ongoing struggle for racial justice.
