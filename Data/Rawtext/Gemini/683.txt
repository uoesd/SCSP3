Judge Defends Rittenhouse Alternate Juror Selection Method

Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder has defended his decision to allow Kyle Rittenhouse to select six alternate jurors from a raffle tumbler, a practice he has employed for nearly two decades without complaints.

"I've been doing this for 19 years, and I've never had a complaint," Schroeder said. "I've never had a problem with it."

The practice is unusual, as typically a courtroom clerk would draw jurors' numbers. However, Schroeder explained that he adopted the method after a trial in Racine, Wisconsin, where the defendant's attorney complained that the clerk was drawing numbers in a way that favored the prosecution.

"I thought, 'Well, that's not a good look,'" Schroeder said. "So I started having the defendant pick the numbers."

Schroeder believes that letting the defendant make the draw makes people feel better and maintains control.

"It gives the defendant a sense of ownership in the process," he said. "It makes them feel like they're part of the process."

Prosecutors and defense attorneys did not oppose Schroeder's decision during the Rittenhouse trial.

"I think it's a fair way to do it," said Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger. "It gives both sides an equal opportunity to select the jurors."

Defense attorney Mark Richards agreed, saying, "I think it's a good system. It's transparent, and it's fair."

Schroeder criticized those questioning the practice as attempting to undermine the trial's result.

"I think it's just a way to try to discredit the verdict," he said. "It's a way to say, 'Oh, the judge was biased against the defendant.'"

Rittenhouse, 18, is charged with fatally shooting two men and injuring a third during civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020. He has pleaded not guilty, claiming self-defense.

Schroeder also addressed his decision to bar the use of the word "victims" to describe the men Rittenhouse shot, noting that it is a standard courtroom rule.

"The word 'victim' is a loaded term," he said. "It implies that someone is guilty of a crime."

Schroeder said that he prefers to use the term "alleged victim" or "person who was shot" to avoid prejudicing the jury.

The trial is expected to continue for several more weeks.
