One Death Reported in Suez Canal Operation to Free Ever Given Ship

Cairo, Egypt - The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) has reported one fatality among its "most prominent losses" during the operation to free the Ever Given ship in the Suez Canal in March. The exact circumstances surrounding the death, including the identity and cause, remain unclear.

The SCA also mentioned the sinking of a rescue boat and the redirection of 48 ships as additional losses incurred during the incident. The death occurred amidst the efforts to salvage the Ever Given, which ran aground on March 23 and remained stuck for six days, causing a significant disruption to global trade.

However, there are no records of a tugboat or marine unit sinking, raising questions about the details provided by the SCA. The SCA has demanded $600 million in compensation from Shoei Kisen Kaisha, the Japanese owner of Ever Given, for the incident.

The ship's insurer, UK P&I Club, considers the $600 million compensation demand too high, while the initial demand was $916 million. Ever Given was impounded in the Great Bitter Lake, around 30 miles from where it got stuck, after it was finally freed on March 29.

The blockage of the Ever Given, one of the world's largest container ships, had a significant impact on global trade, with hundreds of ships waiting to pass through the canal. The incident highlighted the vulnerability of global supply chains and the importance of the Suez Canal as a vital trade route.

The SCA has not released any further details about the death or the other losses incurred during the operation. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and more information is expected to be released in the coming days.
