Trump Unveils TRUTH Social, Aiming to Break Big Tech's Grip

Former US President Donald Trump has announced the launch of his own social media platform, TRUTH Social, marking his return to the digital realm nine months after being banned from major platforms.

The platform, part of Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), is set to provide a voice to those silenced by Big Tech, according to Trump. "We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favorite American President has been silenced," Trump said in a statement.

TRUTH Social is scheduled for a preliminary rollout in November, with a full rollout expected in the first quarter of 2022. Beyond social media, TMTG plans to launch a subscription video-on-demand service, TMTG+, and enter the cloud-computing space.

Trump's announcement comes after his accounts were suspended from Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube following the January 6 Capitol riots. Trump was impeached for his alleged role in inciting the violence but was acquitted by the Senate.

An initial attempt at a blog on his website was abandoned due to low traffic. Trump has since sued Facebook, Twitter, and Google, seeking account restoration and punitive damages.

TRUTH Social aims to fill the void left by Trump's absence from major social media platforms. The platform will reportedly feature a "Truth Feed" where users can post and share content, as well as a "Truth Hub" for news and commentary.

Trump's return to social media is likely to be met with mixed reactions. Some supporters have welcomed the move, while critics have expressed concerns about the potential for misinformation and hate speech on the platform.

The launch of TRUTH Social also raises questions about the future of social media regulation. Trump's ban from major platforms sparked a debate about the role of private companies in moderating content and the potential for censorship.

As TRUTH Social prepares for its launch, it remains to be seen whether it will be able to attract a significant user base and challenge the dominance of established social media giants. However, Trump's announcement is a clear indication that he intends to remain a force in the digital landscape.
