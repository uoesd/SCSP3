Gabby Petito's Final Days: Witnesses Recall Tense Restaurant Argument with Brian Laundrie

JACKSON, Wyo. – Witnesses have come forward to provide new details about the final days of Gabby Petito, the 22-year-old woman whose disappearance and death sparked a nationwide search.

On August 27, 2021, Petito and her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, were seen in a heated argument at the Merry Piglets Tex-Mex restaurant in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Witnesses Nina Celie Angelo and Matthew England, who were in town for a wedding, observed the incident.

"He was being aggressive," Angelo said. "He was arguing with the staff about the bill or something."

England added that Laundrie's behavior was "aggressive and angry."

Petito, according to the witnesses, apologized for Laundrie's behavior. "She was visibly upset," England said.

The incident occurred two days after Petito's final Instagram post and weeks after a domestic fight between the couple was reported in Moab, Utah. Bodycam footage from the Moab police response matches the observed behavior of Petito and Laundrie.

"The bodycam footage is consistent with what the witnesses described," said Josh Taylor, a North Port police spokesperson.

The couple was recognized from their behavior at the restaurant and from the police bodycam footage.

Petito's disappearance followed soon after the restaurant incident. Her remains were later found in a campsite north of Jackson Hole.

Laundrie returned home to Florida without Petito on September 1, retained a lawyer, and refused to speak with police. He later disappeared and his body was found in a Florida nature preserve in October 2021.

Witnesses' Accounts Provide Context

Angelo and England's accounts provide valuable context to the final days of Petito's life. Their observations of Laundrie's aggressive behavior and Petito's distress raise questions about the nature of their relationship and the events leading up to her disappearance.

"It's heartbreaking to think about what Gabby must have been going through," Angelo said. "She was clearly in a difficult situation."

England expressed hope that their testimony would help shed light on the circumstances surrounding Petito's death. "We want justice for Gabby," he said.

Investigation Continues

The investigation into Petito's death is ongoing. The FBI is seeking information about Laundrie's activities in the weeks leading up to his disappearance.

Authorities are also investigating whether Laundrie was involved in Petito's death. The couple's relationship has been described as volatile, with reports of domestic violence.

Domestic Violence Awareness

Petito's case has brought renewed attention to the issue of domestic violence. Experts emphasize the importance of recognizing the signs of abuse and seeking help.

"If you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship, please reach out for help," Taylor said. "There are resources available to support victims of domestic violence."
