Chauvin's History of Force: Ex-Cop Used Strong-Arm Tactics on Six Other Suspects

New York, NY - Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with the murder of George Floyd, has a history of using excessive force against suspects, particularly people of color. According to a report by The Marshall Project, Chauvin has been involved in at least six other incidents since 2015 where he allegedly used strong-arm tactics.

One of the most notable cases is that of Zoya Code, who was arrested by Chauvin in 2017. Code alleges that Chauvin used a neck restraint on her and pressed harder when she challenged him. "He was pressing down on my neck so hard that I couldn't breathe," Code said. "I felt like I was going to die."

Prosecutors in Chauvin's trial for Floyd's death are seeking to use details of Code's arrest to support their second-degree murder charge. However, a judge has excluded five other instances of Chauvin's alleged use of excessive force from the trial.

The Marshall Project interviewed several other alleged victims and witnesses who had violent encounters with Chauvin. Julian Hernandez, who was arrested by Chauvin in 2018, said Chauvin put him in a chokehold as an off-duty security guard. "I thought I was going to die," Hernandez said.

Jimmy Bostic, another alleged victim, claims Chauvin maced and restrained him in 2019 after he asked for a ride. "I was just asking for a ride," Bostic said. "I didn't do anything wrong."

Sir Rilee Peet, who witnessed Chauvin's arrest of Floyd, said he saw Chauvin kneel on Floyd's neck for an extended period. "It was like he was trying to kill him," Peet said.

Monroe Skinaway, another eyewitness, said he heard Floyd repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. "It was heartbreaking," Skinaway said. "I knew he was going to die."

Chauvin's lawyer, Eric Nelson, has argued that these prior incidents were not unreasonable or unauthorized and that Chauvin committed no crimes. "The use of force by Officer Chauvin was reasonable and necessary under the circumstances," Nelson said in court papers.

Nelson did not respond to requests for comment from The Marshall Project.

The allegations against Chauvin raise concerns about the systemic use of excessive force by police officers, particularly against people of color. The victims of Chauvin's alleged brutality have expressed fear for their lives and drawn parallels to Floyd's death.

"I'm afraid for my life," Code said. "I don't know if I'm going to be the next George Floyd."

"I thought I was going to die," Hernandez said. "I'm just glad I'm still alive."

"I'm scared to go outside," Bostic said. "I don't know if I'm going to be the next victim."

The trial of Derek Chauvin is expected to shed light on the extent of his alleged use of excessive force and the systemic issues within the Minneapolis Police Department.
