ISIS-K Suicide Bomber Released from Prison Before Kabul Airport Attack

In a shocking revelation, the ISIS-K suicide bomber responsible for the deadly Kabul airport attack in late August, which claimed the lives of 13 US service members and dozens of Afghans, was released from Parwan prison near Kabul just days before the tragic incident.

The Taliban's swift takeover of the area led to the release of several prisoners, including members of ISIS-K, from Parwan prison at Bagram air base and Pul-e-Charkhi prison near Kabul. This release underscores the chaotic final days of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the challenges faced in securing Kabul airport's perimeter.

Two US officials and Rep. Ken Calvert (California Republican) confirmed the identity of the suicide bomber as Abdul Rehman Al-Loghri. The attack has raised concerns about the potential reconstitution of al Qaeda or ISIS-K within 6 to 36 months, according to Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley.

"We have to be prepared for the resurgence of terrorism in Afghanistan," Milley warned.

Rep. Calvert criticized the handling of the withdrawal, linking it to the events leading to the airport attack. "The Biden administration's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan created a vacuum that allowed the Taliban to take over and release ISIS-K prisoners," Calvert said.

The Biden administration has faced criticism for its decision to abandon Bagram air base, a crucial military complex, and its coordination with Afghan authorities. Officials estimated that 5,000 prisoners were held at Bagram at the time of handover, the majority identified as terrorists.

"The decision to abandon Bagram air base was a strategic blunder that left our troops and Afghan allies vulnerable," Calvert said.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin defended the decision to leave Bagram, emphasizing the focus on protecting the US embassy. "We made the decision to move our forces to the airport to focus on the evacuation of American citizens and Afghan partners," Austin said.

The rapid fall of Afghan districts and eventual control of Kabul by the Taliban was accelerated by the US withdrawal. The Taliban's swift advance caught many by surprise, including US intelligence agencies.

"The collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban's takeover was a major intelligence failure," Milley said.

The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has been widely criticized, with many questioning the Biden administration's handling of the situation. The release of ISIS-K prisoners and the subsequent airport attack have highlighted the challenges of withdrawing from a war-torn country and the potential consequences of leaving behind a security vacuum.
