Senate Republicans Block Independent Commission to Probe Capitol Riot

Washington, D.C. - In a setback for efforts to investigate the January 6 Capitol riot, Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked a bill to establish an independent commission to probe the deadly insurrection.

The bill, which passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support, failed a key procedural vote in the Senate with 54 votes in favor and 35 against, falling short of the 60 votes required to advance.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans of defending the "Big Lie" that the 2020 election was stolen and fearing political repercussions from former President Donald Trump.

"Republicans are saying, 'We don't want to know the truth. We don't want to hold Donald Trump accountable. We don't want to protect our democracy,'" Schumer said.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell argued that the commission would politically damage their party and was unnecessary, given ongoing investigations by the Justice Department and congressional committees.

"This is not about getting to the truth. It's about perpetuating a narrative that divides the country and undermines our institutions," McConnell said.

The proposed commission aimed to probe the security and intelligence failures on January 6 and Trump's role in inciting the riot. It would have been bipartisan, with equal representation from Republicans and Democrats.

Thirty-five House Republicans supported the legislation, but it lacked enough Republican support in the Senate.

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a staunch Trump supporter, warned Republicans that the commission would be used to smear Trump supporters.

"This commission is nothing more than a political witch hunt designed to destroy President Trump and his supporters," Greene said.

Democrats and some moderate Republicans voiced frustration over the opposition, citing the need for accountability.

"We cannot let the perpetrators of this attack get away with it," said Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat.

Gladys Sicknick, the mother of deceased Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died after the riot, expressed her disappointment.

"I'm heartbroken that the Senate has failed to honor my son's memory and the memories of all the other officers who were injured that day," Sicknick said.

With the Senate's rejection, there are calls for a select congressional committee to investigate the January 6 breach. Such a committee would be established by a simple majority vote in the House and Senate, but it would likely face similar partisan divisions.

The failure of the independent commission bill is a significant setback for efforts to fully investigate the Capitol riot and hold those responsible accountable. It remains to be seen whether Congress will be able to overcome partisan gridlock and establish a credible and impartial mechanism to probe one of the darkest days in American history.
