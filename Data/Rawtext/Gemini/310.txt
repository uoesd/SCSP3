Ever Given Insurer Deems Reduced Suez Canal Compensation Claim 'Exceptionally Large'

CAIRO, May 10 (Reuters) – The insurer for the Ever Given container ship, which blocked the Suez Canal for six days in March, has deemed the reduced $600 million compensation claim by the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) as still "exceptionally large."

The SCA initially demanded $916 million in compensation but reduced the claim in an attempt to settle the dispute out of court. However, UK Club, the insurer for the Ever Given's Japanese owner, Shoei Kisen, said the reduced amount was still excessive.

"The claim remains exceptionally large and, in our view, unsupported by the evidence," a UK Club spokesperson said.

The Ever Given has been held in a lake between two stretches of the canal since the incident, and the compensation dispute has prevented its release.

Osama Rabie, head of the SCA, said he saw no immediate prospect of a settlement between the SCA and Shoei Kisen. "We are still far apart," Rabie told Reuters.

UK Club said the Ever Given's owners had not received evidence supporting the size of the compensation claim. "We have not been provided with any evidence to justify the level of the claim," the spokesperson said.

An Egyptian economic court is scheduled to hold a hearing on May 22 regarding the SCA's claim. The court might authorize the SCA to auction off the Ever Given if compensation is refused.

An Egyptian court has already rejected Shoei Kisen's appeal against the ship's detention.

An Egyptian investigation found no wrongdoing by the SCA or its pilots. The investigation concluded that the Ever Given ran aground due to strong winds and a sandstorm.

Rabie said the SCA was confident in its legal position. "We have a strong case, and we are confident that we will prevail in court," he said.

The Ever Given's blockage of the Suez Canal caused significant disruption to global maritime traffic. The canal is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, and the blockage led to delays and increased costs for businesses.

The SCA has said it will use the compensation money to cover the costs of the blockage, including dredging, salvage operations, and lost revenue.

The dispute over compensation is the latest chapter in a saga that has highlighted the challenges of navigating the Suez Canal, one of the world's most important waterways.
