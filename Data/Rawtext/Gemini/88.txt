Trump Lawyers Argue Impeachment Unconstitutional, Dismissal Sought

Washington, D.C. - Former President Donald Trump's legal team has filed a brief arguing that his impeachment is unconstitutional and should be dismissed. The brief, submitted to the Senate, contends that Trump's speech on January 6, which preceded the Capitol riot, is protected by the First Amendment.

"The House's impeachment of President Trump is an unconstitutional act of political theater that sets a dangerous precedent for the future of our democracy," said Bruce Castor, one of Trump's lawyers.

The brief argues that the impeachment lacks due process because Trump is no longer in office. It also claims that the House Democrats' impeachment efforts are politically motivated and aimed at preventing Trump from running for office again.

"The House Democrats have engaged in a political witch hunt against President Trump from the moment he took office," said David Schoen, another of Trump's lawyers. "This impeachment is nothing more than a continuation of their efforts to silence and destroy him."

Trump was impeached on a charge of "incitement of insurrection" after the Capitol was stormed by a mob of his supporters on January 6. The House Democrats allege that Trump's rally and speech near the White House on that day incited the violence.

The legal brief suggests that the Capitol riot was preplanned, citing law enforcement reports of potential attacks. It also argues that Trump's speech was protected by the First Amendment and did not directly incite violence.

"President Trump's speech on January 6 was protected by the First Amendment," said Castor. "He did not call for violence or insurrection. He simply exercised his right to free speech."

Senate leaders have agreed on a timeline for the impeachment trial, allowing four days for opening arguments. The decision on calling witnesses, including possibly Trump himself, will be made early next week.

"We are confident that the Senate will dismiss this unconstitutional impeachment and allow President Trump to move on with his life," said Schoen.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the agreed timeline preserves due process for both sides.

"The Senate will conduct a fair and impartial trial," said Schumer. "We will hear from both sides and then make a decision on whether or not to convict President Trump."

Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) also expressed support for the agreed timeline.

"The Senate will follow the Constitution and conduct a fair trial," said McConnell. "We will hear from both sides and then make a decision on whether or not to convict President Trump."

The impeachment trial is expected to begin next week.
