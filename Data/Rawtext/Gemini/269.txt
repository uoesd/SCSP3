Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Not Recommended for Under-30s in France Due to Myocarditis Risk

Paris, France - The French health authority, Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS), has advised against using Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine for individuals under 30 years of age due to concerns over a "very rare" risk of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle.

The HAS's recommendation is based on recent data and a French study published on Monday, which found that the risk of myocarditis is five times lower with Pfizer's Comirnaty vaccine compared to Moderna's Spikevax for under-30s.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA), the EU's drug regulator, has approved Moderna's booster vaccine for all individuals over 18 years of age, six months after the second dose. However, the EMA has also acknowledged a possible link between rare inflammatory heart conditions and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from both Pfizer and Moderna.

Despite this finding, the EMA has emphasized that the benefits of mRNA vaccines in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks.

The HAS's recommendation applies to the use of the Moderna vaccine as a first, second, or third 'booster' dose for individuals under 30 years of age. For those aged over 30, the HAS recommends the Moderna vaccine, citing its slightly superior effectiveness.

The HAS's recommendation will remain valid until more scientific data on the issue becomes available.

U.S. regulators and the World Health Organization have echoed the EMA's view on the benefits of mRNA vaccines, highlighting their effectiveness in preventing severe COVID-19 and outweighing the potential risks.
