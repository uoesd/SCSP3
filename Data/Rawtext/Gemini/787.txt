IRS Sends Stimulus Checks to Over 90 Million Americans

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has distributed coronavirus relief checks to over 90 million Americans under President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan. The third round of Economic Impact Payments, totaling $1,400 per eligible individual, is designed to provide financial assistance to those affected by the ongoing pandemic.

Additional Payments Forthcoming

The IRS is continuing to process and distribute payments, and additional checks are expected to be sent out in the coming weeks. Individuals can use the IRS's "Get My Payment" tool to check the status of their stimulus payment. The tool updates once daily, and the IRS advises against calling for payment information.

Eligibility and Payment Amounts

The third round of Economic Impact Payments is based on either the 2020 or 2019 tax returns, including for non-filers and those who submitted simplified returns. Individuals who previously received stimulus checks via direct deposit but won't this time will receive either a check or a prepaid debit card.

Social Security and federal beneficiaries will generally receive their payments the same way as regular benefits. The stimulus payment amounts to $1,400 for a single person or $2,800 for a married couple, plus $1,400 for each dependent child.

Income Limits

Payments decrease for those earning above $75,000 ($150,000 for couples), phasing out entirely above $80,000 ($160,000 for couples).

Tax Filing Deadline Extension

Due to COVID relief payments and tax refund delays, the IRS has extended the tax filing deadline to May 17. This extension applies to both individual and business tax returns.

Using the 'Get My Payment' Tool

To use the "Get My Payment" tool, individuals will need to provide their Social Security number, tax ID, date of birth, street address, and ZIP code. The tool will show the status of the payment, including the date it was issued and the method of delivery.

Additional Information

The IRS has provided additional information and resources on its website, including frequently asked questions and contact information. Individuals with questions or concerns should visit the IRS website or call the IRS toll-free number at 1-800-829-1040.

Impact of Stimulus Checks

The distribution of stimulus checks is expected to provide a significant boost to the economy. The payments are intended to help individuals and families cover essential expenses, such as rent, food, and healthcare, and to stimulate consumer spending.

Economic Recovery

The American Rescue Plan is part of the Biden administration's broader efforts to address the economic impact of the pandemic. The plan includes funding for vaccine distribution, unemployment benefits, and small business assistance.

Ongoing Support

The IRS and the Biden administration are committed to providing ongoing support to individuals and businesses affected by the pandemic. The "Get My Payment" tool and other resources are available to assist individuals in receiving their stimulus payments and accessing other forms of financial assistance.

Conclusion
