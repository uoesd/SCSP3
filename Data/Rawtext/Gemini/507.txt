East Coast Transit Systems Face Urgent Need for Climate Resilience

NEW YORK (AP) – The devastation wrought by Hurricane Ida and other summer storms has laid bare the urgent need for improved climate resilience in East Coast transit systems. Despite billions of dollars spent on coastal flooding protection since Superstorm Sandy, recent events have shown that much more work is necessary.

"The recent storms have been a wake-up call," said Sanjay Seth, Boston's "climate resilience" program manager. "We need to be doing more to protect our transit systems from the impacts of climate change."

One of the most ambitious proposals is a plan to build a series of canals in New York City to divert floodwaters away from subway stations. The city is also considering installing curbs at subway entrances to prevent water ingress.

"We need to think big and be bold in our approach to climate resilience," said Janno Lieber, Acting CEO of the Metropolitan Transit Authority. "These canals would provide a vital layer of protection for our subway system."

In Boston, climate change efforts are focused on the Blue Line, which runs along the city's waterfront. Plans are underway to build a seawall and upgrade pumps to protect the line from flooding.

"The Blue Line is one of our most vulnerable assets," said Joe Pesaturo, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. "We need to make sure it's protected from future storms."

Philadelphia has seen mixed success with its post-Sandy flood protection measures. While some areas have been protected, others have still experienced flooding.

"We're still learning and adapting," said Bob Lund, Deputy General Manager of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. "We're going to continue to armor our shorelines with concrete blocks and explore other options to improve our resilience."

In Washington, D.C., the WMATA is developing a climate resiliency plan. The agency has already upgraded its drainage systems and installed pumping stations to reduce flooding.

"We're taking a comprehensive approach to climate resilience," said Sherrie Ly, a spokesperson for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. "We're looking at everything from infrastructure improvements to operational changes."

Despite these efforts, there are concerns that transit systems are not planning ambitiously enough for the challenges posed by climate change.

"We need to be thinking about more than just protecting existing infrastructure," said Jesse Keenan, an associate professor at Tulane University. "We need to be rethinking how we design and build our transit systems to make them more resilient to future storms."

Michael Martello, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, agrees. "We need to be investing in research and development to come up with new and innovative solutions to the challenges of climate change," he said.

Funding remains a major challenge for implementing ambitious climate change projects in transit systems. Many agencies are already facing budget constraints, and the cost of climate resilience measures can be significant.

"We need to find creative ways to finance these projects," said Lieber. "We can't afford to wait any longer to protect our transit systems from the impacts of climate change."

The challenges facing East Coast transit systems are not unique. Global cities like London and Zhengzhou have also struggled with flood management in their transit systems.

"This is a global problem," said Keenan. "We need to share best practices and work together to find solutions."

As the climate continues to change, the need for climate resilience in transit systems will only become more urgent. By investing in innovative solutions and working together, we can create transit systems that are resilient to the challenges of the future.
