Twitch Indefinitely Bans Trump, Citing Potential for Harm

Twitch has indefinitely banned former President Donald Trump, removing his account from the platform. The decision comes after a temporary freeze of Trump's account following the Capitol riot, during which viewers could still access his past streams.

"We have determined that the continued presence of President Trump on our service is a risk to our community and violates our policies," a Twitch spokesperson said. "We have taken this action to protect our community from potential harm."

The ban prevents Trump from appealing or creating another account on Twitch. The decision was made after reviewing Trump's statements, which Twitch interpreted as calls to action that could incite violence.

"We believe that this is a necessary step to protect our community and prevent the platform from being used to incite further violence," the spokesperson added.

Twitch had previously banned the PogChamp emote due to concerns over its use in inciting violence. The platform's rules prohibit hateful conduct, harassment, or incitement of violence, and these policies apply to off-service events as well.

Twitch joins a growing list of social media platforms that have banned Trump after the Capitol siege. Twitter, Shopify, Snapchat, and Facebook have all taken similar actions. Facebook has also indefinitely banned Trump, with COO Sheryl Sandberg stating that it is unlikely he will be allowed back on the platform.

Trump's use of social media to promote election fraud theories has been cited as a contributing factor to the storming of the Capitol. Politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar have increasingly used gaming platforms like Twitch for digital messaging to younger audiences.

Twitch's decision to ban Trump sends a clear message that the platform will not tolerate content that incites violence or poses a risk to its community. The ban is a significant step in the ongoing efforts to combat online extremism and protect users from harmful content.
