Fact Check: Rittenhouse's Mar-a-Lago Stay Was Not a Two-Week Vacation

Following his acquittal in the Kenosha shooting trial, Kyle Rittenhouse visited Mar-a-Lago, the Florida resort of former President Donald Trump. Online claims emerged suggesting that Rittenhouse enjoyed a "two-week, all-expenses-paid vacation" at the exclusive club. However, these claims are inaccurate.

Rittenhouse's Acquittal and Mar-a-Lago Visit

Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges related to the shooting of two people and injuring another during a 2020 protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The verdict sparked widespread debate and controversy.

Shortly after the trial, Rittenhouse traveled to Florida and visited Mar-a-Lago. He met with Trump and gave an interview to Fox News. Trump's spokesperson, Liz Harrington, tweeted a photo of Rittenhouse and Trump at Mar-a-Lago.

Misinformation Spreads

Online claims that Rittenhouse had a "two-week, all-expenses-paid vacation" at Mar-a-Lago gained traction on social media, accumulating thousands of shares. However, these claims are not supported by the facts.

Rittenhouse's Lawyer Denies Two-Week Vacation

Rittenhouse's lead defense attorney, Mark Richards, stated that the claim of a two-week vacation is incorrect. However, he did not specify the length of Rittenhouse's stay at Mar-a-Lago.

Trump Confirms Short Stay

In an interview with Fox News, Trump mentioned that Rittenhouse had left Mar-a-Lago a few days after the verdict. This contradicts the claim of a two-week vacation.

Conclusion

The claim that Kyle Rittenhouse had a "two-week, all-expenses-paid vacation" at Mar-a-Lago is false. Rittenhouse was only at Mar-a-Lago for days at most, not for a two-week vacation.
