Griddy Energy Customers Freed from Winter Storm Bills in Landmark Settlement

Houston, Texas - Griddy Energy customers will no longer be responsible for the exorbitant electricity bills incurred during February's devastating winter storm, under a groundbreaking settlement announced by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.

The settlement stems from a lawsuit filed by Paxton against Griddy Energy, alleging misleading advertising that led to customers receiving astronomical bills during the storm. Griddy offered a wholesale electricity rate, which resulted in bills skyrocketing as demand surged during the power outages.

"This settlement is a major victory for Texans who were misled by Griddy Energy's deceptive marketing," said Paxton. "We will continue to fight for the rights of consumers and hold companies accountable for their actions."

The winter storm left millions of Texans without power and resulted in at least 210 deaths. The extreme weather conditions caused a surge in electricity demand, driving up wholesale prices and leaving Griddy customers with bills that, in some cases, exceeded $10,000.

Following the legal challenges, Griddy Energy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The settlement announced today releases former Griddy customers from any outstanding balances unless they choose to opt out. Customers who paid their bills can seek reimbursement through bankruptcy court.

The settlement also includes provisions to prevent Griddy and its parent company, Cielo Energy, from engaging in misleading advertising in the future.

"This settlement provides much-needed relief to Texans who were victimized by Griddy Energy's deceptive practices," said Paxton. "We are committed to protecting consumers and ensuring that companies operate fairly and honestly."

The settlement is a significant development in the ongoing legal battle surrounding the winter storm. It provides a resolution for former Griddy customers who were burdened with overwhelming bills and sends a clear message to energy companies that misleading advertising will not be tolerated.
