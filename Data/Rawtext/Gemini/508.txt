Nassau County Included in Major Disaster Declaration for Hurricane Ida Relief

New York, NY - Governor Kathy Hochul today announced that Nassau County has been included in the Major Disaster Declaration for Hurricane Ida, unlocking federal assistance for individuals and communities impacted by the storm.

"This Major Disaster Declaration is a critical step in our recovery from Hurricane Ida," Governor Hochul said. "Federal assistance will provide much-needed support to our communities and residents as they rebuild and recover."

The declaration, approved by President Biden, makes federal assistance available to Nassau County, as well as the previously declared counties of New York City, Westchester, Rockland, Suffolk, and Dutchess.

"I want to thank President Biden and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell for their support in securing this disaster declaration," Governor Hochul added. "Their commitment to helping New Yorkers recover from this devastating storm is greatly appreciated."

Nassau County Executive Laura Curran said, "I am grateful to Governor Hochul and FEMA for recognizing the severe impact of Hurricane Ida on Nassau County. This disaster declaration will provide much-needed assistance to our residents and businesses as they work to recover and rebuild."

The Major Disaster Declaration authorizes FEMA to provide Individual Assistance, which includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and families recover from the effects of the storm.

FEMA's Public Assistance Program will also provide grants to state and local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations for the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged public infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and utilities.

"FEMA is committed to supporting New Yorkers in their recovery from Hurricane Ida," said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. "This Major Disaster Declaration will provide essential assistance to individuals and communities as they work to rebuild and recover."

The New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services (DHSES) worked closely with FEMA to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Ida and apply for federal aid.

"DHSES is committed to ensuring that New Yorkers have access to all available resources to help them recover from Hurricane Ida," said DHSES Commissioner Jackie Bray. "We will continue to work closely with FEMA and other partners to support our communities and residents."

Preliminary damage assessments indicate that Hurricane Ida caused over $140 million in damages to public infrastructure and homes in Nassau County, with approximately 2,900 homes affected.

Governor Hochul also announced that New York State will receive $378 million in hazard mitigation funding from FEMA to strengthen state infrastructure against extreme weather events.

"This funding will help us to make our communities more resilient to future storms," Governor Hochul said. "We are committed to building back better and stronger than before."

Residents and businesses in Nassau County who have been affected by Hurricane Ida are urged to apply for federal assistance. Applications can be made online at DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362).
