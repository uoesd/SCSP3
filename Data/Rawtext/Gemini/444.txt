Harry and Meghan Quit Social Media, Citing 'Hate' and 'Toxicity'

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, have reportedly quit social media, deleting their official royal Instagram account, @sussexroyal, which had over 10 million followers. The couple's decision comes amid growing criticism of social media companies for their role in political events, particularly referencing Donald Trump's indefinite suspension.

According to The Sunday Times, there are no plans for their non-profit organization, Archewell, to use social media, nor for the couple to return personally. This move away from social media follows their step down as senior royals and a move towards financial independence in the US.

Harry and Meghan's disillusionment with social media stems from the "hate" and "toxicity" they encountered online, particularly on platforms like Instagram. Meghan has previously spoken out about the severe impact of online abuse on her mental health, claiming to be the most trolled person in 2019.

The couple's decision to quit social media aligns with their stated goal of using their platform to drive systemic cultural change through non-profit work and media production. Archewell aims to create a more compassionate and equitable world, without the need for an official social media presence.

Harry and Meghan have signed deals with Spotify and Netflix to produce podcasts and documentaries, which will allow them to continue to share their message and connect with audiences without the negative aspects of social media.

Previously, the couple had stated an intention to continue using social media after stepping down as senior royals. However, it appears that their experiences online have led them to reconsider their approach.

The decision by Harry and Meghan to quit social media highlights the growing concerns about the role of these platforms in society. The couple's move away from social media is a significant step, and it remains to be seen whether other public figures will follow their lead.

In the meantime, Archewell continues to work towards its mission of creating a better world, without the need for social media validation. The couple's commitment to using their platform for good is commendable, and it will be interesting to see how they continue to make a difference in the years to come.
