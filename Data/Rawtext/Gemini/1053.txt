FBI Confirms Remains Found in Florida Are Brian Laundrie, Gabby Petito's Boyfriend

Oct 21 (Reuters) – The FBI confirmed on Thursday that the remains found in a Florida nature reserve last month are those of Brian Laundrie, the boyfriend of Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old woman who was found strangled to death in Wyoming.

Laundrie, 23, had been missing for over a month after Petito's body was discovered in a remote area of Grand Teton National Park on September 19. He was named a person of interest in her murder, and a massive manhunt was launched to find him.

The couple embarked on a cross-country road trip from Florida to New York and then westward across the United States, documenting their journey on social media. However, their trip took a tragic turn in August when a 911 caller reported seeing them fighting in Moab, Utah. Police officers separated them for a night, but no charges were filed.

Petito was last seen leaving a hotel in Salt Lake City on August 24. Her final communication was with her mother on August 25, saying they were headed to Grand Teton National Park.

Travel bloggers spotted what they believed to be the couple's van in Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming on August 27. Petito's family reported her missing on September 11, and Laundrie was named a person of interest by police on September 15.

On October 12, the Teton County Coroner announced that Petito's death was caused by strangulation approximately three to four weeks before her body was found.

Laundrie's remains were found in the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park in North Port, Florida, on October 20. The FBI said in a statement that dental records confirmed his identity.

The discovery of Laundrie's remains brings closure to the Petito family, who have been grieving the loss of their daughter. However, many questions remain unanswered about what happened during the couple's cross-country trip and why Laundrie killed Petito.

The FBI is continuing to investigate the case, and no charges have been filed against Laundrie.
