Army Widow Grieves Loss of Husband Killed in Kabul Attack

FORT BRAGG, N.C. (WTVD) – Alena Knauss is still struggling to come to terms with the loss of her husband, Army Staff Sgt. Ryan C. Knauss, who was killed in the Kabul airport attack on August 26, 2021.

"It's been a rollercoaster of emotions," Alena said. "There are moments when I feel like I'm drowning in grief, and then there are moments when I feel a sense of peace knowing that he died doing what he loved."

Ryan, 23, was assigned to the 8th Psychological Operations Group at Fort Bragg. He joined the Army in 2016, the same year he and Alena got married.

"He was so excited to serve his country," Alena said. "He always wanted to make a difference in the world."

Ryan's last deployment was to Afghanistan, where he was part of an evacuation mission at the Kabul airport. On August 26, a suicide bomber attacked the airport, killing Ryan and 12 other service members.

Alena's last message to her husband was a simple expression of love. "I told him how much I loved him and asked him to respond when he could," she said. "I never got a response."

Ryan's death has left a void in Alena's life, but she is determined to honor his memory.

"He was such a charismatic person who loved to help others," Alena said. "He was always the first one to volunteer for anything."

Ryan was also dedicated to his field, and Alena believes he would have repeated his actions knowing the outcome.

"He knew the risks, but he was willing to put himself in harm's way to help others," Alena said. "That's the kind of person he was."

The Kabul airport attack was a tragedy that claimed the lives of 13 service members. Alena and the families of the other victims are still grieving their loss, but they are also grateful for the time they had with their loved ones.

"Ryan was a hero," Alena said. "He died serving his country, and I'm so proud of him."
