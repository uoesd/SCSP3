Deadly Kabul Airport Attack Ends Canada's Afghanistan Mission

OTTAWA – Canada's military mission in Afghanistan concluded hours before a deadly attack at Kabul airport, where suicide bombers targeted crowds, killing at least 11 American marines and one navy medic.

The withdrawal, aimed to meet the U.S.-led mission's deadline of August 31, left an unknown number of Canadians and their families trapped in Afghanistan. Canadian Forces confirmed all Canadian military personnel involved in the withdrawal are safe and accounted for.

"The situation on the ground is extremely fluid and unpredictable," said Acting Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre. "We are working closely with our partners to ensure the safety of our people and to continue to support the evacuation of Canadians and Afghans who are at risk."

Despite the attacks, U.S. Central Command Commander Gen. Kenneth McKenzie highlighted the real threat of ISIS and continued evacuation efforts. "We are committed to continuing our mission to evacuate American citizens, third-country nationals, and vulnerable Afghans," he said. "We will not be deterred by threats from the enemy."

The U.S. attributes the attacks to ISIS-K, with the expectation of further attacks. Over 47,000 Afghan civilians and more than 66,000 Afghan military and police died in the war. Canada evacuated approximately 3,700 people from Afghanistan.
