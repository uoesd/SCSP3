Royals Considered New Zealand Move in 2018, Former Governor-General Reveals

In a surprising revelation, former Governor-General of New Zealand, Patsy Reddy, has disclosed that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle considered relocating to the country in 2018. The couple's interest in New Zealand emerged during their visit to the picturesque Abel Tasman National Park.

"They were very interested in New Zealand," Reddy recalled. "They were talking about the possibility of moving here."

The discussion, which took place less than six months after their wedding, occurred before the couple's eventual move to the United States. Reddy emphasized that the conversation was informal, with the couple exploring their future plans and aspirations for raising a family.

"It was a very personal conversation," Reddy said. "They were talking about their hopes and dreams for the future."

The revelation aligns with the couple's subsequent comments in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, where they mentioned considering a move to a Commonwealth country like New Zealand.

"We did think about Canada, we did think about New Zealand," Meghan said. "We thought about those places because we wanted to be able to work and live together."

Reddy's disclosure comes as she prepares to step down from her ceremonial role in October after a five-year term. During her tenure, she has maintained a close relationship with the Queen, sending her hand-typed letters sharing her personal perspectives on New Zealand.

Despite some republican sentiments among New Zealanders, Reddy remains a staunch supporter of the monarchy.

"I think the monarchy is a very important part of our constitutional system," she said. "It provides stability and continuity."

Reddy's successor, Cindy Kiro, will become the first Indigenous woman to hold the position of Governor-General. Kiro, a renowned children's advocate, is expected to bring a fresh perspective to the role.

"I'm very excited about the future of New Zealand," Reddy said. "I think we're in very good hands."

The revelation of Prince Harry and Meghan's interest in New Zealand has sparked speculation about their potential return to the Commonwealth. However, the couple has not publicly expressed any plans to relocate again.
