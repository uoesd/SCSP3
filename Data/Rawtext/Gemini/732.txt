Canton Police Search Plymouth Canton Educational Park for Armed Student, Find No Suspect

Canton police conducted an extensive search at Plymouth Canton Educational Park on Thursday after a student reported seeing another student with a weapon, leading to a hours-long lockdown.

The search, which involved multiple law enforcement agencies, was initiated around 11:30 a.m. after a student reported seeing a fellow student with a gun. The complex houses three high schools, affecting approximately 6,000 students.

"I was in my English class, and then all of a sudden, the teacher came on the intercom and said, 'Lockdown, lockdown, lockdown,'" said Kenedy Williams, a student at Salem High School. "Everyone started freaking out."

Students and parents expressed fear and concern, referencing the recent Oxford High School shooting.

"I was terrified," said Acelino Villarini, another student. "I thought I was going to die."

During the lockdown, students prepared to defend themselves, arming with makeshift weapons.

"I grabbed a pair of scissors and a stapler," said Tyler Bond, a student at Plymouth High School. "I was ready to fight for my life."

Canton Police Chief Chad Baugh confirmed that everyone is safe and no injuries were reported.

"We are grateful that this incident ended peacefully," said Baugh. "We take all threats seriously, and we will continue to investigate this matter thoroughly."

No one was taken into custody, and no weapons were found during the search. However, police are continuing to investigate and are reviewing surveillance footage.

"We are still trying to determine what happened and who is responsible," said Baugh.

The incident has heightened anxiety among parents and students, following a series of threats against schools in Southeast Michigan.

"I'm scared to send my kids to school," said Larry Pado, a parent of two students at the complex. "I don't know if they're safe."

"This is becoming all too common," said Marie Castle, another parent. "We need to do something to stop these threats and keep our children safe."

Plymouth Canton Community Schools cancelled all classes and programs for Friday, prioritizing student safety and well-being.

"The safety and well-being of our students and staff is our top priority," said Superintendent Monica Merritt. "We will continue to work with law enforcement to ensure that our schools are safe."

The incident adds to the ongoing discussion about school safety and the impact of such events on students and communities.

"This is a wake-up call," said Baugh. "We need to have a serious conversation about how to prevent these tragedies from happening."
