Michigan School Shooting: Suspect Met with Parents, Officials Hours Before Attack

Oxford High School in Michigan was rocked by a horrific tragedy on Tuesday, November 30, when a 15-year-old sophomore, Ethan Crumbley, allegedly opened fire, killing four students and injuring seven others. The suspect has been charged as an adult with four counts of first-degree murder, seven counts of assault with intent to murder, and one count of terrorism.

Concerning Behavior Emerges

Disturbingly, it has emerged that the suspect had meetings with his parents and school officials just hours before the attack due to concerning behavior. Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard revealed that the suspect's office was unaware of any alarming behavior prior to the shooting. However, two teachers had raised concerns about his behavior, leading to meetings with school officials.

"We had no idea that this individual was capable of doing something like this," Sheriff Bouchard said. "There were no red flags that we were aware of."

Premeditated Attack

Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald has highlighted a "mountain of digital evidence" suggesting that the shooting was premeditated. At the arraignment, it was revealed that the suspect had made videos and kept a journal outlining plans for the shooting.

"This was not a snap decision," Prosecutor McDonald said. "This was something that was planned out in advance."

Gun Purchased Days Before

Adding to the tragedy, it has been revealed that the gun used in the attack was bought by the suspect's father, James Crumbley, four days before the shooting. Oakland County Assistant Prosecutor Marc Keast confirmed that the father had purchased the 9mm Sig Sauer pistol on Black Friday.

"We are investigating the father's role in this," Prosecutor McDonald said. "We are considering charges against him."

Calls for Gun Law Reform

In the wake of the shooting, Prosecutor McDonald has called for revisiting gun laws.

"We need to have a conversation about gun laws in this country," she said. "We need to make sure that guns are not getting into the hands of people who should not have them."

Suspect Faces Life Without Parole

The suspect, Ethan Crumbley, faces life without parole if convicted. He is currently being held without bond in the Oakland County Jail.

Victims Identified

The four students who were killed in the shooting have been identified as Tate Myre, 16; Hana St. Juliana, 14; Madisyn Baldwin, 17; and Justin Shilling, 17.

Community in Mourning

The Oxford community is reeling from the tragedy. A vigil was held on Wednesday night to remember the victims and support their families.

"This is a devastating loss for our community," said Oxford Community Schools Superintendent Tim Throne. "We are heartbroken and we are going to need time to heal."

Investigation Ongoing

The investigation into the shooting is ongoing. The Oakland County Sheriff's Office is working with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to determine the motive behind the attack.
