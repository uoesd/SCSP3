Venmo Unveils 'Cash a Check' Feature for Seamless Stimulus Check Deposit

The second round of stimulus payments is now being distributed to eligible US adults through direct deposit, paper checks, and EIP cards. To further streamline the process, Venmo has introduced a new 'Cash a Check' feature, enabling select customers to cash their stimulus checks directly into their Venmo accounts.

Eligibility and Requirements

To utilize Venmo's check-cashing feature, users must meet certain eligibility criteria. These include having a verified email address, an active Venmo debit card or direct deposit, and enabling location services on their device.

Partnership and Fees

Venmo has partnered with First Century Bank and Ingo Money to provide this service. As a subsidiary of PayPal, Venmo's check-cashing feature is also linked to its parent company. Notably, Venmo is waiving all fees associated with cashing government stimulus checks, allowing users to access their stimulus money without incurring any deductions.

Fee Waiver and Resumption

Venmo has committed to waiving fees for cashing stimulus checks up to a total of $400,000. Once this threshold is reached, the check-cashing feature will resume normal operations with applicable fees.

Step-by-Step Process

To cash a stimulus check using Venmo, users can follow these steps:

Download the Venmo app on their mobile device.
Verify their account information, including their email address and phone number.
Within the Venmo app, select the 'Cash a Check' option.
Take clear photos of the front and back of the stimulus check.
Venmo will conduct a review process to ensure the funds are available.
Once approved, the check amount will be deposited into the user's Venmo account.

Instant Access and Waiting Period

Venmo offers two options for accessing the deposited funds: instant access or a standard waiting period. Instant access incurs a fee, while the standard waiting period is free. For stimulus checks, the instant access fee is waived.

Tracking and Managing Stimulus Payments

In addition to the 'Cash a Check' feature, Venmo provides users with tools to track and manage their stimulus payments. The app displays the status of the payment, including whether it has been issued, deposited, or cashed.

Potential Third Stimulus Check

While the second round of stimulus payments is currently being distributed, discussions are ongoing regarding a potential third stimulus check. Venmo's 'Cash a Check' feature and other services will be available to facilitate the distribution of future stimulus payments if authorized.

Conclusion

Venmo's 'Cash a Check' feature offers a convenient and accessible way for eligible US adults to cash their stimulus checks. By waiving fees for stimulus checks, Venmo is helping individuals access their financial assistance quickly and efficiently. As the distribution of stimulus payments continues, Venmo remains committed to providing users with the tools they need to manage their finances effectively.
