Ever Given Crew Smiles Amidst Compensation Dispute, Indian Sailors' Fate Uncertain

Cairo, Egypt - The crew of the Ever Given, the massive container ship that blocked the Suez Canal for six days in March, have posed for a group picture amidst an ongoing compensation dispute between the vessel's owners and the Egyptian authorities.

The Ever Given's blockade caused an estimated £7 billion daily loss to world trade and delayed over 400 ships. Egypt has demanded $1 billion in compensation and has seized the ship, anchoring it in the Great Bitter Lake.

The 25 Indian sailors on board have been on the ship for two months without a clear prospect of returning home soon. Union officials in India express concern that the crew may be kept as 'hostages' until the ship's owners pay the demanded compensation.

"We are concerned about the welfare of our sailors," said Abdulgani Serang, a representative of the National Union of Seafarers of India. "They have been on the ship for two months now, and there is no clear indication of when they will be allowed to return home."

Two crew members were allowed to leave the ship for personal reasons, and a second master has flown out to join the ship. Serang said that a welfare visit was important to convey solidarity and support to the crew.

"We want to assure them that we are doing everything we can to get them home," Serang said.

The ship's insurer, the U.K. P&I Club, reported receiving a $916 million claim, which it described as 'largely unsupported.' The club said that negotiations were ongoing.

"We are confident that the vessel was operated professionally and competently at the time of the incident," a spokesperson for the U.K. P&I Club said.

Legal actions include a limited liability suit filed by the ship's owners in London's High Court and efforts to settle the compensation dispute.
