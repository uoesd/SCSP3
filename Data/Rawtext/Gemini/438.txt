Oprah's Interview with Harry and Meghan: A Seismic Shift for the Royal Family

Oprah Winfrey's highly anticipated interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle is set to air on CBS on March 7th, marking a pivotal moment in the couple's transition from British royalty to potential Hollywood elite.

The interview will be the couple's first since stepping back from their royal duties in early 2020. It has sparked intense interest in both the US and the UK, with concerns raised over the timing of the interview, given Prince Philip's hospitalization. However, US commentators have focused on a potential 'smear' campaign by the palace.

"This is a huge moment for Harry and Meghan," said Robert Thompson, Professor of TV and Film at the Newhouse School at Syracuse University. "It's their chance to tell their story on their own terms and to address the many misconceptions and criticisms that have been leveled against them."

The Sussexes have been active in the US since their move, discussing issues like racism, police brutality, and voting rights. They have also secured deals with Netflix and Spotify, signaling their intention to establish themselves in the entertainment industry.

"Harry and Meghan's move to the US has been a game-changer for the royal family," said Keli Goff, US columnist. "They've challenged the monarchy in ways that no one has done before, and they've shown that it's possible to break free from the constraints of tradition."

The couple's statements and actions have been credited with changing the royal family and continuing to challenge the monarchy. Their interview with Oprah is expected to cover the racism Meghan faced in the UK, their treatment by the British press, and their motivation for moving to the US.

"This interview is an opportunity for Harry and Meghan to address the many misconceptions and criticisms that have been leveled against them," said Maiysha Kai, Managing Editor of the Glow Up and Co-host of The Root Presents: It's Lit. "They've been accused of everything from being ungrateful to being attention-seekers, and they're finally getting a chance to set the record straight."

Oprah Winfrey, who has become close to the couple in the US, is seen as a guiding figure in their transition to life outside royal duties. Winfrey's interview with Harry and Meghan is expected to be a bombshell, with the potential to reshape the public's perception of the couple and the royal family.

"This interview is going to be a game-changer for Harry and Meghan," said Mark Borkowski, British brand expert. "It's their chance to re-invent their public image and to show the world who they really are."

A recent poll found that Queen Elizabeth II remains the favorite royal among Americans, but Harry and Meghan are also popular. The formal separation of Harry and Meghan from royal duties allows for a possible re-invention of their public image.

"Harry and Meghan are no longer bound by the constraints of the royal family," said Thompson. "They're free to speak their minds and to pursue their own interests. This interview is a sign that they're ready to embrace their new life in the US."

The interview with Oprah is a seismic shift for the royal family. It marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new one. Harry and Meghan are no longer content to play by the rules of the monarchy. They're ready to forge their own path, and this interview is their chance to show the world who they really are.
