Texans Demand Reforms After Winter Storm, Poll Shows

AUSTIN, Texas – A poll conducted by The University of Texas at Austin has revealed overwhelming support among Texans for reforms to prevent a repeat of the devastating winter storm that crippled the state in February.

The poll, which surveyed 1,200 registered voters, found that 75% of respondents blamed the lack of winterization of electricity facilities for the storm's impact, while 64% pointed to the lack of winterization of gas facilities. Additionally, 68% cited the unprecedented nature of the storm as a contributing factor.

"The results of this poll show that Texans are demanding action to ensure that our energy infrastructure is prepared for future extreme weather events," said James Henson, executive director of the Texas Politics Project at UT Austin.

The poll also found strong support for specific reform proposals. Eighty-five percent of respondents support requiring energy providers to weatherize their facilities, while 53% favor government funding for weatherization. Proposals to ensure higher energy reserves and require ERCOT board members to reside in Texas also received substantial support.

"These findings indicate that Texans are serious about holding energy providers and policymakers accountable for the failures that led to the winter storm," Henson said.

The poll also revealed the significant impact the storm had on Texans. Sixty-six percent of respondents experienced electricity outages during the storm, with many reporting prolonged power loss, internet issues, and financial impacts.

"The winter storm had a devastating impact on the lives of many Texans," Henson said. "These results show that the public is demanding reforms to prevent a similar crisis from happening again."

The poll also assessed the public's approval of various entities involved in the storm response. ERCOT, the Public Utility Commission, and the Railroad Commission of Texas received low approval ratings. Governor Greg Abbott received a 41% approval rating for his handling of the storm, slightly higher than the Texas Legislature and state-level entities.

"The public's dissatisfaction with the response to the winter storm is evident in these approval ratings," Henson said. "Texans are looking for leadership and accountability from their elected officials and energy providers."

Local governments were viewed more favorably in their response to the storm than state officials.

"Local governments were often the first responders to the storm and provided essential services to their communities," Henson said. "This poll suggests that Texans appreciate the efforts of their local leaders."

The poll results underscore the urgent need for reforms to improve the resilience of Texas' energy infrastructure and prevent future winter storm disasters. Texans are demanding action from energy providers and policymakers to ensure that the state is better prepared for extreme weather events.
