WHO Designates Omicron Variant as Variant of Concern

Geneva, 26 November 2021 - The World Health Organization (WHO) today designated the B.1.1.529 variant, named Omicron, as a variant of concern (VOC). This designation is based on the evidence that Omicron has several mutations that may affect its transmissibility and the severity of the disease it causes.

Implications for Public Health

The emergence of Omicron is a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over. It is important for countries to remain vigilant and to implement effective public health measures to prevent the spread of the virus. These measures include:

  • Enhancing surveillance and sharing data to track the spread of Omicron and identify new cases.
  • Reporting cases and performing investigations to understand the characteristics and impact of Omicron.
  • Implementing effective public health measures, such as physical distancing, mask-wearing, and hand hygiene.
  • Addressing inequities in access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to protect themselves from the virus.

Individual Actions

Individuals can also play a role in preventing the spread of Omicron by taking the following actions:

  • Getting vaccinated and boosted as soon as possible.
  • Wearing a mask in public settings.
  • Maintaining physical distance from others.
  • Washing hands frequently.
  • Staying home if sick.

WHO's Response

WHO is coordinating global research efforts to better understand Omicron's characteristics and impact. The organization is also working with countries to strengthen their surveillance and response systems.

WHO will continue to provide updates on Omicron as more information becomes available.
