Woods Expresses Gratitude for Golfing Community's Support After Accident

Following a serious car accident that left him with significant injuries, golf legend Tiger Woods has expressed his gratitude to fellow golfers for their unwavering support.

During the WGC-Workday Championship, several top golfers paid tribute to Woods by wearing his signature red shirt and black pants. Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, and others donned the attire as a gesture of solidarity and respect.

"It means the world to me," Woods said in a statement. "To see the guys out there playing in my colors, it's just incredible. It helps me get through this difficult time."

The tournament's eventual winner, Collin Morikawa, also acknowledged Woods in his victory speech. "Tiger is an inspiration to us all," Morikawa said. "We're all thinking of him and wishing him a speedy recovery."

Woods suffered a single-vehicle accident in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, on February 23. His car hit a sign, sheared through a tree, and flipped over. First responders had to extricate Woods from the vehicle due to the extensive damage.

He underwent emergency surgery at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center for significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity. "Mr. Woods suffered significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity that were treated during emergency surgery by orthopedic trauma specialists at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center," said Dr. Anish Mahajan, Chief Medical Officer at the hospital.

Following the initial surgery, Woods was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for follow-up procedures. Sources indicate that Woods has a long recovery ahead but remain optimistic about his eventual return to the golf course.

"I'm so grateful for the outpouring of support from the golf community and beyond," Woods added. "It's been a tough time, but I'm determined to come back stronger than ever."

The accident has sent shockwaves through the golfing world and beyond. Woods, a 15-time major champion, is widely regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time. His recovery and potential return to the sport are eagerly anticipated by fans and fellow players alike.
