Rittenhouse Acquitted in Kenosha Shootings, Sparking Debate and Calls for Unity

KENOSHA – A jury on Friday found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty on all charges in connection to the fatal shootings of two men and the wounding of a third during protests in Kenosha last year.

The verdict, which came after three days of deliberation, supports Rittenhouse's claim that he acted in self-defense when he opened fire on the demonstrators on Aug. 25, 2020.

"We are obviously very happy with the outcome," said Corey Chirafisi, one of Rittenhouse's defense attorneys. "We felt that the evidence supported self-defense from the very beginning."

Lead prosecutor Thomas Binger expressed disappointment with the verdict, saying that he believed the evidence showed that Rittenhouse was not acting in self-defense.

"We respect the jury's verdict, but we do not agree with it," Binger said.

Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley said that the verdict "speaks for itself."

"The jury has spoken, and we respect their decision," Graveley said.

Rittenhouse, now 18, showed little emotion as the verdict was read. He hugged his attorneys and thanked the jury.

"I'm just glad it's over," Rittenhouse said. "I'm just glad I can go home and be with my family."

Rittenhouse's other defense attorney, Mark Richards, said that the verdict was a "victory for the Second Amendment."

"This is a case where a young man was exercising his Second Amendment rights," Richards said. "He was attacked by a mob, and he defended himself."

The victims' families expressed disappointment and anger at the verdict.

"This is a miscarriage of justice," said Karen Bloom, the mother of Anthony Huber, one of the men who was killed. "Kyle Rittenhouse is a murderer."

John Huber, Anthony's father, said that the verdict sends a dangerous message.

"This verdict tells people that they can get away with murder if they claim self-defense," Huber said.

President Joe Biden said that he was "deeply disappointed" by the verdict.

"While the jury has spoken, I am deeply disappointed in the verdict," Biden said. "We must continue to fight for a more just and equitable society."

U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said that the verdict was "a victory for the rule of law."

"The jury has spoken, and they have found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty," Johnson said. "This is a victory for the rule of law."

Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes (D-Wis.) said that the verdict "is a reminder that our justice system is broken."

"This verdict is a reminder that our justice system is broken," Barnes said. "It is a system that too often fails to hold white people accountable for their actions."

Governor Tony Evers (D-Wis.) called for peace and unity in the wake of the verdict.

"Now is the time for healing and unity," Evers said. "We must come together as a community and work to build a better future for all."

The Rittenhouse case has intensified debates over gun rights, self-defense, and racial justice in the United States. The case has also raised questions about the role of vigilantes in society.

Rittenhouse was 17 at the time of the shootings, which occurred during unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake Jr., a Black man. Rittenhouse, who is white, traveled to Kenosha from his home in Antioch, Illinois, with an AR-15-style rifle. He said that he went to Kenosha to protect businesses from rioters.

The defense argued that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense against perceived threats from demonstrators. Prosecutors portrayed Rittenhouse as a vigilante seeking conflict, questioning his self-defense claim.

The jury's verdict has sparked calls for peaceful acceptance from both sides of the political spectrum. Some people have called for protests against the verdict, while others have urged for calm and unity.

The verdict is likely to be appealed, and the case could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
