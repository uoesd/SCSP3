Tragedy in Michigan: 15-Year-Old Kills Three, Wounds Eight in School Shooting

Nov 30 (Reuters) – A 15-year-old boy used a semi-automatic pistol purchased by his father to shoot and kill three fellow students at Oxford High School in Michigan on Tuesday, wounding eight others before being apprehended by law enforcement.

The motive behind the shooting remains unclear, as the suspect has declined to speak with investigators, according to Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard.

"We have no idea why," Bouchard said at a news conference. "We're hoping to get some answers from him."

The incident occurred about 40 miles north of Detroit, with over 100 calls for assistance made to the emergency dispatch center. Swift action by sheriff's deputies, who confronted the shooter as he advanced down a hallway, is credited with preventing a higher casualty toll.

"I'm very proud of the way our deputies responded," Bouchard said. "They went in and did their job."

The suspect is being held under suicide watch in a juvenile detention center, with prosecutors to decide on charges and whether he will be charged as an adult or a juvenile.

The three students who died were identified as Tate Myre, 16; Hana St. Juliana, 14; and Madisyn Baldwin, 17. Of the eight others injured, two were hospitalized with gunshot wounds to the head.

The shooter used a 9 millimeter semi-automatic handgun, which had been purchased by his father four days before the attack.

"This is a senseless tragedy," said Oakland County Executive David Coulter. "Our hearts go out to the victims and their families."

President Biden expressed condolences and highlighted the incident as part of a uniquely American problem related to gun control and mental health.

"My heart goes out to the families of the victims of this horrific shooting," Biden said in a statement. "We must address the root causes of gun violence in this country."

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer also expressed condolences and called for action to prevent future tragedies.

"This is a time for mourning and reflection," Whitmer said. "But it is also a time for action. We must come together to protect our children and prevent these senseless tragedies from happening again."

During the shooting, students and teachers barricaded themselves, and some students escaped out a back window after refusing to open a barricaded classroom door for someone claiming to be with the sheriff's office.

"I'm so proud of our students and staff for their bravery and quick thinking," said Oxford High School Principal Steve Wolf. "They saved lives today."

The shooting has sent shockwaves through the Oxford community and beyond. Residents gathered for a vigil on Tuesday night to mourn the victims and support the survivors.

"This is a close-knit community," said Oxford resident Mary Smith. "We're all hurting right now."

The investigation into the shooting is ongoing.
