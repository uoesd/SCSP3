CNN's 'Cuomo Prime Time' Plummets Amidst Andrew Cuomo Scandals

The viewership of CNN's 'Cuomo Prime Time' has taken a nosedive in recent months, coinciding with the mounting public scandals surrounding New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.

Once a ratings juggernaut, 'Cuomo Prime Time' averaged 2.2 million viewers when Governor Cuomo was a regular guest on the show. However, after CNN barred coverage of the governor on the show, viewership plummeted to 1.6 million viewers, a significant drop of 27%.

The decline is even more pronounced in the key demographic of adults 25-to-54, with a 42% viewership loss compared to 2020. This demographic is crucial for advertisers, making the loss particularly damaging for CNN.

The decline in viewership is directly linked to the multiple scandals engulfing Governor Cuomo, including sexual harassment accusations and alleged nursing home death coverups. The governor has denied any wrongdoing, but the allegations have cast a dark cloud over his administration.

CNN's decision to prevent Chris Cuomo, the show's host, from covering his brother's scandals was communicated in February 2021. The network cited a longstanding policy against family members covering each other, with an exception made during the pandemic.

Chris Cuomo's viewership has suffered significantly since the scandals, with a 30% drop after Lindsey Boylan's accusation of sexual harassment against Governor Cuomo. The host addressed the situation on air, stating that he could not cover his brother's scandals due to their relationship.

However, public scrutiny increased as Chris Cuomo had previously covered his brother in more favorable times. This perceived bias led to accusations of nepotism and a lack of journalistic integrity.

The decline in viewership has been consistent, with 'Cuomo Prime Time' experiencing its worst week in 2021 with only 1.2 million viewers. The show's future remains uncertain as the scandals surrounding Governor Cuomo continue to unfold.

CNN has not publicly commented on the viewership decline, but sources within the network have expressed concern about the show's trajectory. It remains to be seen whether 'Cuomo Prime Time' can regain its former glory or if the scandals surrounding Governor Cuomo have permanently damaged its reputation.

The decline of 'Cuomo Prime Time' is a cautionary tale about the dangers of mixing family and journalism. The public's trust in the media is paramount, and any perceived bias can have devastating consequences. CNN's decision to prevent Chris Cuomo from covering his brother's scandals was a difficult one, but it was ultimately the right one. The network must now work to rebuild trust with its viewers and ensure that its journalism remains impartial and objective.
