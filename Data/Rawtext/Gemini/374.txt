Roger Waters Rejects Facebook Ad Offer, Condemns Company's Influence

Legendary Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters has rejected a substantial financial offer from Facebook to use one of the band's songs in an advertisement. Waters vehemently condemned Facebook's influence, accusing the company of attempting to dominate and censor.

"I will not be a party to the systematic destruction of our planet and the suppression of truth," Waters declared. "Facebook is a beast that is out of control."

Waters criticized Facebook's origins, referring to Mark Zuckerberg's early project, FaceMash, which allowed users to rate the attractiveness of female students. "It's a company that was founded on the objectification of women," Waters said.

He expressed concerns about Facebook and Instagram's growing power and their role in censorship. "They are suppressing stories about Julian Assange," Waters said. "They are trying to control what we see and what we hear."

During his condemnation, Waters read aloud from Facebook's request, highlighting the company's interest in the song's "core sentiment." "They want to use our music to sell their product," Waters said. "They want to use it to make themselves look good."

A Facebook spokeswoman stated that Zuckerberg was not involved in the request, which came from the Instagram marketing team. "It is common for companies to approach musicians for the use of their songs in ads," the spokeswoman said. "We respect the decisions of artists regarding collaborations."

Waters used the offer to emphasize his stance against corporate dominance and censorship. "This is not about money," he said. "This is about protecting our freedom and our democracy."
