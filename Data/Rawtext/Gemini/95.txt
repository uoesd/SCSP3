Citigroup's $900 Million Mistake: Creditors Keep Windfall

New York City - A New York federal judge has ruled that 10 creditors can keep $500 million mistakenly transferred to them by Citigroup, in a case that has raised questions about the responsibilities of creditors when a bank overpays.

In August 2020, Citigroup mistakenly transferred nearly $900 million of its own funds instead of an $8 million interest payment from Revlon to its creditors. After the transfer, some creditors returned $400 million, but 10 others refused to return $500 million.

Citigroup sued to recover the funds, but Judge Jesse Furman ruled that the firms could keep the mistakenly transferred money. Furman cited legal precedents and the creditors' reasonable belief that the payment was intentional due to its accuracy.

"The creditors acted reasonably in believing that the payment was intentional and that they were entitled to keep it," Furman wrote in his decision.

The ruling was influenced by New York law, which aims to discourage banks from making such errors.

"New York law places a high burden on banks to ensure the accuracy of their wire transfers," Furman said. "This is because wire transfers are irrevocable and can be difficult to trace."

Adam Abensohn, representing the asset managers, argued that there is nothing unfair about keeping money that is owed.

"These are sophisticated financial institutions that received money that they were owed," Abensohn said. "There is no reason why they should have to return it."

The case poses a dilemma between the principle of returning mistakenly sent money and the right to use money repaid exactly as owed.

"On the one hand, it seems unfair for the creditors to keep money that was not intended for them," said Jennifer Taub, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. "On the other hand, the creditors acted reasonably in believing that the payment was intentional."

The decision, which may be appealed by Citigroup, has raised questions about the responsibilities of creditors when a bank overpays.

"This case highlights the need for clear rules about what happens when a bank makes a mistake," said Lee Reiners, a former senior official at the Federal Reserve. "The current system is too uncertain and leaves too much room for litigation."

The case has also sparked a debate on rules versus principles in financial transactions.

"The judge's decision was based on a strict interpretation of the law," said Robert Jackson, a law professor at New York University. "But it is important to remember that the law is not always just. In this case, the creditors are being allowed to keep money that was not intended for them."
