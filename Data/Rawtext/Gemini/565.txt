US Embassy in Kabul Evacuated as Taliban Seizes Control of Afghanistan

CNN – Kabul, Afghanistan

The United States embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, has been evacuated and the American flag taken down, marking the closure of the diplomatic compound as the Taliban took control of the Presidential Palace in Kabul.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered an additional 1,000 US troops into Afghanistan, bringing the total to 6,000, to manage the evacuation of embassy staff and other American citizens.

"We are doing everything we can to get our people out of harm's way," Austin said. "We will not abandon our Afghan partners who have fought alongside us for two decades."

The Taliban takeover of the Presidential Palace was broadcast live on al Jazeera, with Taliban fighters seen entering the compound and raising their flag.

Approximately 500 embassy staff were airlifted out of Afghanistan from a total of 4,000 employees awaiting evacuation.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the evacuation as "deliberate, orderly," and stated that document destruction is standard procedure.

"We are working around the clock to get our people out of Afghanistan," Blinken said. "We are committed to the safety and security of our personnel."

General Frank McKenzie of the US Central Command arrived in the Persian Gulf to oversee the Afghanistan situation.

"We are working closely with our partners on the ground to ensure a safe and orderly evacuation," McKenzie said. "We are committed to supporting the Afghan people and the Afghan government."

A military team set up its air traffic control at Kabul airport to increase evacuation flight numbers.

President Joe Biden and senior national security officials are assessing the situation from Camp David via secure video teleconference.

Most American diplomats have been moved to Kabul airport to fly back to the US, with a small number of core personnel remaining there.

The Taliban assumed control of Kabul and the Presidential Palace, with former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fleeing the country.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the group would not harm civilians and would respect women's rights.

"We want to assure the international community that we will not allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for terrorism," Mujahid said.

The evacuation of the US embassy and the Taliban takeover of Kabul mark a significant turning point in the 20-year war in Afghanistan.
