Harry and Meghan Join Global Citizen's Vaccine Campaign

Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have been appointed as campaign chairs for Global Citizen's vaccination effort, "Vax Live: The Concert to Reunite the World." The event, scheduled for May 8, aims to deliver COVID-19 vaccines to medical workers in poor countries.

"We must look beyond ourselves with empathy and compassion for those who are far less fortunate than us," said Harry. "Millions of people around the world cannot access the vaccine, and with vaccine hesitancy, we are creating the perfect storm for a prolonged global pandemic."

The concert will feature appearances by President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and leaders from France, Canada, and Croatia. It is part of the "We Can Do This" initiative, which aims to increase vaccine confidence and encourage equitable distribution.

"We need to make sure that everyone, everywhere has access to the vaccine," said Hugh Evans, CEO of Global Citizen. "This is a global crisis, and it will take a global effort to solve it."

Harry and Meghan's role includes raising money for COVAX, a global initiative that funds vaccines for medical workers. They will also advocate for businesses and G7 countries to donate and share vaccines.

"As we work to end this pandemic, we must remember that we are all connected," said Meghan. "No one is safe until everyone is safe."

As of April, 60 nations had not received any COVID-19 vaccines, according to Evans. The concert aims to address this inequity by urging pharmaceutical companies to offer vaccines at not-for-profit prices.

"We cannot leave anyone behind," said Emmanuel Macron, President of France. "We must work together to ensure that everyone has access to the vaccine."

The concert will feature performances and appearances by global celebrities, including Jennifer Lopez, Selena Gomez, and Eddie Vedder. It will be broadcast on ABC, CBS, and YouTube.

"This is a moment for us to come together and make a difference," said Evans. "We can end this pandemic, but only if we do it together."
