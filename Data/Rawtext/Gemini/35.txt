Military Chiefs Condemn Capitol Insurrection, Warn Against Impeding Biden Inauguration

In a strongly worded statement, the top military leaders in the United States have condemned the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, describing it as a direct assault on the nation's democratic institutions.

The statement, signed by all eight members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, emphasized that the rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not justify violence, sedition, and insurrection. The military leaders warned service members against impeding President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, reminding them that any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is against the law.

"The violent riot in Washington, D.C., on January 6, 2021, was a direct assault on the U.S. Congress, the Capitol building, and our Constitutional process," the statement reads. "We strongly condemn the rioters who stormed the Capitol and disrupted a joint session of Congress to count electoral votes."

The letter, which was sent to all U.S. military members, comes amid concerns that some veterans and possibly active-duty troops were allegedly involved in the Capitol attack. The military leaders felt compelled to address the issue partly because of these allegations.

"We are committed to upholding the Constitution, defending our democracy, and supporting the peaceful transfer of power," the statement continues. "We will not tolerate violence, sedition, and insurrection within our ranks."

The Joint Chiefs of Staff, led by Army Gen. Mark Milley, are responsible for advising the President and the Secretary of Defense on military matters. They are typically apolitical and tend to speak out only on highly egregious matters.

In their statement, the military chiefs reaffirmed their commitment to supporting and defending the Constitution and the forthcoming inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th Commander in Chief.

"We will continue to work closely with our civilian leaders to ensure a smooth and orderly transition of power," the statement concludes. "We are confident that our nation will emerge from this challenge stronger than ever."

The statement from the Joint Chiefs of Staff is a significant step in condemning the Capitol insurrection and reaffirming the military's commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law. It sends a clear message to service members that violence and insurrection will not be tolerated within the ranks.
