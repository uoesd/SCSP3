Cuomo's Deadly Nursing Home Cover-Up: 13,000 Lives Lost

In a shocking revelation that has sent shockwaves through the nation, Governor Andrew Cuomo's office has been accused of underreporting COVID-19 related nursing home deaths in New York during the spring of 2020. The alleged cover-up was reportedly orchestrated to avoid triggering a federal investigation by the Trump administration.

The underreporting came to light after an investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James, which found that the Cuomo administration had intentionally excluded thousands of nursing home deaths from its official count. The report revealed that the state's official count admitted to about 7,000 nursing home deaths, while estimates suggested around 12,000. James's investigation concluded that the real death toll was closer to 13,000.

"The Cuomo administration's failure to accurately report nursing home deaths is a grave disservice to the families of the victims and to the public," said James. "This cover-up must be fully investigated and those responsible must be held accountable."

The underreporting was allegedly part of a broader effort by the Cuomo administration to downplay the severity of the pandemic in New York. In March 2020, State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker issued a mandate requiring nursing homes to admit infectious COVID-19 patients, even if they did not have the capacity to properly isolate them. This mandate contributed to the spread of the virus within nursing homes, leading to a surge in deaths.

"We were not prepared for the influx of COVID-19 patients into our nursing homes," said Zucker. "We made the best decisions we could with the information we had at the time."

Cuomo did not lift the mandate until May 10, after substantial deaths had occurred in nursing homes. By that time, thousands of elderly New Yorkers had already lost their lives.

The revelations about the nursing home cover-up have cast a dark shadow over Cuomo's handling of the pandemic. Despite initially receiving national acclaim and media adulation for his daily COVID-19 briefings, Cuomo has faced increasing criticism for his actions.

"Governor Cuomo's handling of the pandemic has been a disaster," said Assemblyman Ron Kim. "He put politics ahead of public health and the result has been thousands of unnecessary deaths."

Cuomo's top aide, Melissa DeRosa, has acknowledged that the administration withheld information about nursing home deaths to avoid federal scrutiny. In a phone call with Democratic lawmakers, DeRosa said, "We froze because then we were in a position where we weren't sure if what we were going to give to the Department of Justice, or what we give to you guys, what we start saying, was going to be used against us."

The Biden Justice Department is not expected to pursue investigations into Cuomo's actions. However, the New York State Assembly is currently conducting an impeachment inquiry into Cuomo's handling of the pandemic.

The nursing home cover-up is a tragic example of the consequences of putting politics ahead of public health. The families of the victims deserve justice, and those responsible for this cover-up must be held accountable.
