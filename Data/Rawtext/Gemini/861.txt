Tiger Woods Undergoes Additional Surgeries After Devastating Car Accident

Golf legend Tiger Woods underwent additional follow-up procedures on Friday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, following a horrific car accident on Tuesday. The procedures were necessary to address injuries sustained in the crash.

Woods was initially treated at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he underwent emergency surgery to insert a rod into his tibia and screws and pins into his foot and ankle. The surgeries were successful, according to a statement released on Woods' Twitter account.

"Tiger Woods underwent additional procedures on his right leg on Friday, March 26, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles," the statement read. "The procedures were successful, and he is recovering and in good spirits. Tiger and his family want to thank the incredible surgeons, doctors, nurses, and staff at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for their outstanding care."

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department ruled the accident "purely accidental," emphasizing that Woods' seatbelt and the vehicle's safety features likely saved his life.

"It's very fortunate that Mr. Woods was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash," said Sheriff Alex Villanueva. "It's very fortunate that the interior of the vehicle remained intact, which gave him the cushion to survive what otherwise would have been a fatal crash."

Dr. Anish Mahajan, Chief Medical Officer of Harbor-UCLA, commented on Woods' transfer to Cedars-Sinai for continuing care.

"Mr. Woods was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for continuing orthopedic care and recovery," Mahajan said. "His injuries are serious, but we are optimistic that he will make a full recovery."

Experts predict that Woods will need additional surgeries and have a prolonged recovery due to the severity of his leg injuries.

"These are very complex injuries that will require multiple surgeries and a long rehabilitation process," said Dr. Michael Zuri, a specialist in sports injuries. "It's too early to say when he will be able to return to competitive golf."

Dr. David Agus, a professor of medicine at USC, echoed Zuri's concerns.

"The risk of infection is always a concern with this type of injury," Agus said. "We also don't know how long it will take for his bones to heal and for him to regain full range of motion in his leg."

Woods was in Los Angeles for the Genesis Invitational and promotional activities. He has not competed professionally since December.

The golf world and beyond have rallied around Woods, sending messages of support and prayers for his recovery.

"Tiger is a true champion, and we know he will fight through this," said PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan. "We wish him all the best in his recovery."
