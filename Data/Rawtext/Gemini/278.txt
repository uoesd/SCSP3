COVID-19 Cases Surge Again, Driven by Delta Variant and Low Vaccination Rates

WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, with new infections doubling over the past three weeks, driven by the highly contagious delta variant, low vaccination rates, and Fourth of July gatherings.

Confirmed infections have climbed to an average of about 23,600 a day, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This represents a significant increase from the low point of about 11,000 cases per day in late June.

"We're seeing a rapid increase in cases, and it's being driven by the delta variant," said Dr. Bill Powderly, co-director of the Infectious-Disease Division at Washington University's School of Medicine in St. Louis. "This variant is much more transmissible than the original strain of the virus, and it's causing more severe illness in younger people."

The rise in cases is particularly concerning in states with low vaccination rates. For example, Mississippi and Louisiana, which have some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, are experiencing significant increases in cases.

"We're seeing a huge surge in cases in our state," said Erik Frederick, chief administrative officer of Mercy Hospital Springfield in Missouri. "Our hospitals are filling up, and we're having to turn away patients."

Health authorities in some areas are urging even vaccinated people to wear masks again, especially in indoor public settings. The CDC has not yet recommended a return to universal masking, but it has advised that vaccinated people in areas with high transmission rates consider wearing masks in crowded indoor settings.

"We're not seeing a lot of breakthrough infections in vaccinated people, but we are seeing some," said Dr. James Lawler, leader of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. "Wearing a mask can help to reduce the risk of infection, even for vaccinated people."

Despite the rising case numbers, deaths from COVID-19 remain much lower than they were during the peak of the pandemic in January. This is likely due to the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing severe illness and death.

"The vaccines are working," said Powderly. "They're not perfect, but they're very effective at preventing serious illness and death. If you're not vaccinated, I urge you to get vaccinated as soon as possible."

The Biden administration is boosting vaccination efforts among young people with the help of celebrity Olivia Rodrigo. Rodrigo, who has a large following on social media, has been using her platform to encourage young people to get vaccinated.

"I know that getting vaccinated can be scary, but it's the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones," Rodrigo said in a recent video message. "If you're not vaccinated, please get vaccinated as soon as possible."

Despite the efforts to increase vaccination rates, there is resistance in some states to reintroducing restrictions or preventive measures. For example, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has banned local governments from requiring masks or proof of vaccination.

"We're not going to let the government tell us what to do," DeSantis said at a recent press conference. "We're going to let people make their own decisions about their health."

Health experts are concerned that the resistance to preventive measures could lead to a further surge in cases and deaths.

"We're at a critical point in the pandemic," said Lawler. "If we don't take action now, we could see a significant increase in cases and deaths. We need to get more people vaccinated, and we need to reintroduce preventive measures in areas with high transmission rates."
