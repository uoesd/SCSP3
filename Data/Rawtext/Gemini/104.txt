Chris Cuomo Terminated from CNN After External Review

New York – CNN has announced the immediate termination of anchor Chris Cuomo following an external review by a law firm. The review focused on Cuomo's involvement in his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's, defense against sexual harassment accusations.

"We have terminated Chris Cuomo's employment at CNN," said Jeff Zucker, President of CNN Worldwide. "This decision is based on new information that came to light about Chris's involvement in his brother's defense."

CNN had suspended Cuomo indefinitely earlier this week pending the outcome of the review. Michael Smerconish will temporarily host Cuomo's former 9 p.m. Eastern time slot.

The termination comes after the release of documents by New York Attorney General Letitia James, which revealed Chris Cuomo's deep involvement in advising his brother amid the scandal. Cuomo has maintained that he never reported on the scandal or interfered with CNN's coverage of it.

However, internal backlash at CNN grew against Cuomo following the release of the documents. Sources within the network expressed concerns about Cuomo's judgment and his ability to remain impartial in his reporting.

"I have never lied to CNN about my involvement with my brother's defense," Cuomo said in a statement. "I have always been transparent about my relationship with my brother and my role in his defense."

Following his termination, a lawyer revealed a new sexual misconduct allegation against Chris Cuomo from a former junior colleague at another network. Debra Katz, the lawyer representing the accuser, stated that the incident occurred in 2011.

"My client has made the difficult decision to come forward now, after the recent allegations against Mr. Cuomo came to light," Katz said. "She felt compelled to share her experience in the hope that it will help others who have been victims of sexual misconduct."

Cuomo has denied the allegation, calling it "false and defamatory."

CNN emphasized that Cuomo's termination was due to a breach of their standards, prompted by the findings of the external review.

"We take matters of ethics and journalistic integrity very seriously," Zucker said. "We expect our employees to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, and when those standards are violated, we will take appropriate action."

The termination of Chris Cuomo marks a significant development in the ongoing scandal surrounding his brother. It also raises questions about the future of CNN and its commitment to journalistic ethics.
