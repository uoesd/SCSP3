Texans to Pay Billions in Gas Bills for Winter Storm Profits

Texas regulators have approved a plan that will allow gas companies to collect $3.4 billion from customers to cover unexpected debt from skyrocketing gas prices during February's winter storm and blackout. The cost may be added to Texans' gas bills for up to 30 years.

The move by the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) is part of a process known as securitization, approved by state legislators last spring. Securitization aims to spread out the financial impact on consumers by converting debt into low-interest bonds paid over decades.

During the winter storm, gas prices surged, leading to massive profits for gas companies and accusations of price gouging. It remains unclear how much monthly bills will increase for individual ratepayers as a result of the securitization.

Critics accused state lawmakers and the RRC of prioritizing gas company profits over consumer needs.

"This is a massive giveaway to the gas industry," said Paula Gold-Williams, former head of San Antonio's publicly owned utility. "Texans should not be forced to pay for the industry's greed."

Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, a consumer advocacy group, said the RRC's handling of the situation was "deeply troubling."

"The commission has failed to protect consumers from price gouging and is now allowing gas companies to profit from a disaster," Palacios said.

Doug Lewin, head of Stoic Energy, a renewable energy company, said the securitization plan "sets a dangerous precedent."

"It allows gas companies to pass on their financial risks to consumers, even when those risks are caused by their own mismanagement," Lewin said.

Governor Greg Abbott has also come under fire for receiving a $1 million campaign contribution from Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, one of the gas companies that will benefit from the securitization plan.

"It's clear that Governor Abbott is more interested in protecting the interests of his wealthy donors than in helping Texans," Palacios said.

The RRC has defended its decision, saying that securitization is the best way to minimize the financial impact on consumers.

"This is a fair and reasonable solution that will help Texans avoid a significant increase in their gas bills," said RRC Chairman Wayne Christian.

However, critics argue that the RRC is downplaying the potential risks of securitization.

"This plan could end up costing Texans billions of dollars over the next 30 years," Lewin said. "It's a huge gamble that could have disastrous consequences."

The securitization plan is still subject to approval by the Texas Supreme Court. If the court approves the plan, gas companies could begin collecting the $3.4 billion from customers as early as next year.
