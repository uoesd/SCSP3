Taliban's Takeover and Aftermath: A Month of Turmoil and Transition in Afghanistan

Sept 15 (Reuters) – The Taliban's swift capture of Kabul on August 15 marked a turning point in Afghanistan's history, triggering chaos, global criticism, and a month of uncertainty and transition.

Immediate Chaos and Evacuations

As Taliban fighters entered the capital, panic ensued. Foreigners and Afghans alike rushed to leave the country, leading to chaotic scenes at Kabul airport. At least seven people were killed in the ensuing crush and gunfire.

Biden's Address and Global Criticism

U.S. President Joe Biden faced intense criticism for the chaotic withdrawal of American troops, which many saw as a failure of U.S. policy. On August 17, Biden addressed the nation, defending the decision to withdraw but acknowledging the challenges ahead.

Taliban's Promises and Protests

In a press conference, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid promised respect for women's rights and no reprisals against former government officials. However, anti-Taliban protests erupted in several cities, and violent incidents, including a suicide bomb attack at Kabul airport, marred the month.

"We are committed to the rights of women under the framework of Islamic law," Mujahid said. "We will not seek revenge against anyone."

Taliban's Measures and U.S. Drone Strikes

In response to reports of atrocities and economic turmoil, the Taliban announced measures to tackle lawlessness and stabilize the economy. The U.S. military conducted drone strikes against Islamic State threats near Kabul airport, killing several militants.

U.S. Troop Withdrawal and Taliban Government

On August 30, U.S. Central Command announced the completion of the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Taliban subsequently announced a new government on September 7, led by Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund. Kabul airport reopened for aid and domestic flights.

"The withdrawal of U.S. forces is complete," said U.S. General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command. "This represents the end of the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan."

International Aid and Humanitarian Crisis

International donors pledged $1.1 billion for Afghanistan amidst a worsening humanitarian crisis. The United Nations warned that half of the country's population faced acute hunger, and millions were displaced.

Ongoing Challenges and Uncertain Future

As Afghanistan enters a new era under Taliban rule, the country faces numerous challenges, including economic instability, security threats, and the need for reconciliation. The international community continues to monitor the situation closely, with concerns about the Taliban's ability to govern effectively and respect human rights.

The Taliban's takeover has brought a mix of hope and uncertainty to Afghanistan. While some welcome the end of the war, others fear a return to the repressive regime of the past. The coming months will be crucial in determining the country's future and the role of the international community in supporting its people.
