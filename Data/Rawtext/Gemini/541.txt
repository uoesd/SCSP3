Biden Honors Fallen Heroes in Dignified Transfer Ceremony at Dover Air Force Base

Dover Air Force Base, Delaware - President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden paid their respects to the 13 American service members killed in the Kabul airport attack during a dignified transfer ceremony at Dover Air Force Base on Sunday.

The ceremony, held under the shadow of criticism over Biden's handling of the exit from Afghanistan, honored the fallen soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, along with other dignitaries, joined Biden at the solemn event.

In a moving speech, Biden hailed the fallen soldiers as "heroes" and expressed the personal pain of loss, recalling his late son Beau.

"These American heroes who gave their lives, they're part of a legacy of sacrifice and service that spans generations," Biden said. "They're the best of us. They're the very best of us."

The Kabul airport attack, which killed more than 100 Afghans, was blamed on a regional arm of the Islamic State. In response, the US launched drone strikes on Islamic State targets.

Biden has faced criticism over the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, with approximately 250 US nationals remaining in the country.

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan assured those remaining that "they are not going to be stuck in Afghanistan."

"We are going to get them out," Sullivan said. "We are going to get them out as quickly as possible."

However, critics, including Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, have lambasted Biden's withdrawal strategy.

"This is a catastrophe," Sasse said. "This is a disaster of epic proportions."

McConnell accused Biden of "abandoning" Americans and Afghan allies.

"The Biden administration's withdrawal from Afghanistan has been a complete and utter failure," McConnell said.

Despite the criticism, Biden vowed to continue the evacuation efforts.

"We will not rest until we have brought every American home," Biden said.

The dignified transfer ceremony at Dover Air Force Base was a somber reminder of the sacrifices made by American service members in Afghanistan. As the nation mourns the loss of these heroes, questions linger about the future of the US presence in the war-torn country.
