Tiger Woods Crash Investigation: Sheriff's Department Obtains Black Box Warrant

Los Angeles, California - The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has obtained a search warrant for the black box from Tiger Woods' crashed car, a move that could provide crucial details about the circumstances leading up to the accident.

However, the department has not sought a warrant for Woods' blood to determine if he was under the influence of any substances at the time of the crash.

"This is part of a routine investigation," emphasized Deputy John Schloegl. "It does not necessarily indicate that we are conducting a criminal investigation."

The black box, also known as the event data recorder, contains data on the vehicle's speed, steering, brake, and acceleration before the crash. This information could help investigators determine whether Woods was speeding, distracted, or impaired at the time of the accident.

In 2017, Woods was found asleep at the wheel with various medications in his system. However, there was no evidence of impairment observed in Woods immediately after the crash.

Accident reconstruction experts have suggested that Woods may not have been paying attention to the road, possibly even asleep at the wheel.

"The data from the black box could provide valuable insights into what happened in the moments leading up to the crash," said Jonathan Cherney, an accident reconstruction expert.

Initially, Sheriff Alex Villanueva called the crash "purely an accident," but the department has not yet concluded the cause of the incident.

"We are still gathering evidence and conducting interviews," said Villanueva. "Once we have a complete picture of what happened, we will make a determination on whether any charges are warranted."

Genesis, the car's manufacturer, has taken possession of the vehicle after the sheriff's department completed its examination.
