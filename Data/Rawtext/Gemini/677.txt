Milwaukee Protests Erupt After Rittenhouse Acquittal, Denouncing Verdict as Setback for Racial Justice

Over 100 demonstrators took to the streets of Milwaukee on Saturday, November 20, to denounce the not-guilty verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, expressing outrage and concern over its implications for racial justice and the safety of protesters.

The protest, organized by the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (MAARPR), was a response to the acquittal of Rittenhouse, who was charged with killing two people and wounding a third during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020. The shootings occurred amid unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man.

"This verdict is a slap in the face to the Black community and to all those who believe in justice," said Mariah Smith, a speaker from the Peoples Revolution. "It sends a clear message that white people can kill Black people with impunity."

The protesters marched from Red Arrow Park to the Federal Courthouse downtown, chanting slogans such as "No Justice No Peace No Racist Police" and "Black Lives Matter." Along the way, they stopped at the scene of a fatal police shooting in 2016 to pay their respects.

At the courthouse, several speakers addressed the crowd, expressing their grief and anger over the verdict.

"This verdict is a tragedy for the families of the victims, for the city of Kenosha, and for our nation as a whole," said Omar Flores, co-chair of MAARPR. "It shows that our justice system is broken and that it does not value Black lives."

Dale Stohre, a retired minister, said he was "heartbroken" by the verdict. "This is not just about Kyle Rittenhouse," he said. "It's about all the Black people who have been killed by police and vigilantes with impunity."

Milwaukee resident Nathaniel Haack said the verdict has a chilling effect on the right to protest peacefully. "It sends a message that if you protest against police brutality, you could be met with violence," he said.

Adelana Akindes, a participant from Students for a Democratic Society, criticized the portrayal of protesters as rioters and looters by Judge Bruce Schroeder, who oversaw Rittenhouse's case. "The judge's comments were inflammatory and biased," she said. "They helped to create a climate of fear and intimidation that made it difficult for protesters to exercise their First Amendment rights."

The protesters vowed to continue fighting for racial justice and to hold police accountable for their actions. They called for the resignation of Judge Schroeder and for a new trial for Rittenhouse.

"We will not be silenced," said Smith. "We will continue to protest until Black lives matter in this country."
