UN Security Council Demands Taliban Guarantee Safe Passage, Prevent Terrorism

New York, United States - The United Nations Security Council has unanimously adopted a resolution demanding that the Taliban ensure safe passage for those seeking to leave Afghanistan and prevent the country from becoming a safe haven for terrorists.

The resolution, which was mainly pushed by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, strongly condemned the deadly attack at Kabul airport by the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP). The attack claimed the lives of over 150 people and injured more than 200.

"The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the deplorable terrorist attack that took place on 26 August 2021, at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, which resulted in the deaths and injuries of hundreds of civilians," the resolution stated.

The resolution emphasized the importance of safe passage for Afghans and foreign nationals at any time, regardless of their affiliation. It called on all parties to facilitate humanitarian assistance with safe and unhindered access.

"The Security Council emphasizes the importance of the safe, secure, and orderly departure from Afghanistan of Afghan and international citizens, who wish to do so, and calls for all parties to cooperate in this regard," the resolution said.

The United States has evacuated over 122,000 people from Afghanistan since July, including American citizens, Afghan allies, and other vulnerable individuals. However, thousands of people remain stranded in the country, desperate to leave.

"We must continue to work together to ensure that those who wish to leave Afghanistan are able to do so safely and with dignity," said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US Ambassador to the UN.

France and the UK stressed the importance of protecting human rights and the gains made over the past two decades.

"We must not allow the progress made in Afghanistan over the past 20 years to be reversed," said Nathalie Estival-Broadhurst, Deputy Permanent Representative of France to the UN.

"The protection of human rights, including the rights of women and girls, must be a priority," said Barbara Woodward, UK Ambassador to the UN.

Russia abstained from voting, citing the resolution's failure to address concerns about combating international terrorism.

"The resolution does not adequately address the issue of combating international terrorism, which is a major threat to Afghanistan and the region," said Vassily Nebenzia, Ambassador of Russia to the UN.

China emphasized that the chaos in Afghanistan is tied to the disorderly withdrawal of foreign troops and called for reflection.

"The hasty and disorderly withdrawal of foreign troops has led to the current chaotic situation in Afghanistan," said Geng Shuang, Ambassador of China to the UN. "We need to reflect on the lessons learned from this experience."

The resolution seeks to hold the Taliban accountable to their commitments as judged by their actions. It calls on the Taliban to respect the human rights of all Afghans, including women and girls, and to establish an inclusive government that represents the diversity of the Afghan people.

"The Security Council will continue to monitor the situation in Afghanistan closely and will take further action as necessary," the resolution stated.
