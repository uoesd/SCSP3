Royal Absence: Harry, Meghan, and Other Royals Miss Trooping the Colour

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were among the notable absentees at this year's Trooping the Colour ceremony, which took place on Saturday. The couple, who recently welcomed their baby girl, Lilibet, did not attend the event.

Other notable absences included Kate Middleton and Prince William. Only two royals attended the event: the Queen and her cousin, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. In the past, the event has seen large gatherings of royal family members on the balcony.

Trooping the Colour, known as The Queen's Official Birthday Parade, is typically a grand celebration in central London. However, COVID-19 restrictions resulted in a scaled-down ceremony this year. The palace had announced in March about the reduced attendance due to the pandemic. Consultations with Government and other relevant parties led to the decision to alter the event's traditional format.

Despite the reduced attendance, the ceremony still featured a display of military precision and pageantry. The Queen inspected the troops from the Quadrangle of Windsor Castle, while the Duke of Kent took the salute. The event concluded with a flypast by the Royal Air Force.
