'The Murder of Gabby Petito' Documentary to Premiere on Peacock

NBC's Peacock streaming service is set to air a documentary on Friday titled "The Murder of Gabby Petito: Truth, Lies and Social Media." The documentary will delve into the life, disappearance, and tragic death of Gabrielle "Gabby" Petito.

The documentary will feature exclusive interviews with Petito's parents, Nicole Schmidt and Joseph Petito, as well as her stepparents, Jim Schmidt and Tara Petito. Never-before-seen photos and stories of Petito's life will be shared, offering a glimpse into her personality and the events leading up to her disappearance.

"This is every parent's nightmare," said Jim Schmidt in the documentary. "You never think something like this could happen to your child."

Petito's story gained global attention after she vanished during a cross-country trip with her fiancé, Brian Laundrie. Her body was later discovered in Grand Teton National Park, and her death was ruled a strangulation. Laundrie, the primary person of interest in Petito's disappearance, was found deceased in a Florida nature preserve, with his death ruled a suicide.

The documentary will also explore the significant role that social media investigators played in the case. Petito's disappearance and death sparked a massive online search effort, with countless people sharing information and theories on social media platforms.

"Social media was a double-edged sword in this case," said Patricia McKnight, a Herald-Tribune reporter who covered the story. "It helped spread awareness and generate leads, but it also fueled a lot of misinformation and speculation."

The documentary will recount the tragic story of Gabby Petito through the perspectives of her family and the journalistic accounts of those who followed the case. It will offer a comprehensive look at the events that led to her disappearance and death, while also highlighting the role of social media in the investigation.
