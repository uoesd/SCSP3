DeSantis Proposes Stiff Fines for Social Media Companies Penalizing Politicians

TALLAHASSEE – Governor Ron DeSantis has unveiled a proposal to impose hefty fines on social media companies that block politicians, a move widely seen as a response to the banning of former President Donald Trump from major platforms.

The proposed legislation, unveiled during a press conference on Tuesday, would levy a $100,000 daily fine on social media companies that de-platform candidates for public office in Florida. The bill aims to protect politicians' speech on social media, even if it incites violence.

"We're not going to let Big Tech silence our voices," DeSantis declared. "We're going to fight back against the censorship and the suppression of conservative speech."

The proposal comes amid ongoing debates about the role of social media companies in moderating content and the potential for bias against certain political viewpoints. Trump's lawyers have argued that his speech before the Capitol riot was protected under the First Amendment, disputing claims that he incited violence.

"The First Amendment protects the right to speak freely, even if that speech is offensive or unpopular," said David Schoen, one of Trump's lawyers. "The government cannot censor speech simply because it disagrees with it."

DeSantis has been a vocal critic of social media companies, accusing them of bias against conservatives. He cited the lack of action against Black Lives Matter and Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as examples of this alleged bias.

"These companies have shown time and time again that they are willing to silence conservative voices," DeSantis said. "We're not going to stand for it anymore."

The proposed legislation would require social media companies to give a 30-day notice before suspending accounts and to explain the reasons for suspensions. It would also classify promotional content for candidates as political contributions and mandate transparency in how content is prioritized or suppressed.

"We need to make sure that social media companies are playing by the rules," said Blaise Ingoglia (R-Spring Hill), Chair of the Florida House Commerce Committee. "This legislation will help to ensure that they are not silencing conservative voices."

DeSantis also argued that the Hunter Biden story suppression proves social media bias. He criticized platforms for not moderating threats against him.

"These companies have a responsibility to protect their users from violence and harassment," DeSantis said. "They're not doing that."

DeSantis avoided directly answering whether he believes the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, instead comparing the situation to claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

"I think there are a lot of questions that need to be answered about the 2020 election," DeSantis said. "We need to get to the bottom of what happened."

Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, a Democrat, suggested the focus should be on reducing Big Tech's monopoly power at the federal level, rather than Florida attempting to regulate private companies.

"We need to break up Big Tech," Fried said. "They have too much power and they're using it to silence conservative voices."

Senate President Wilton Simpson (R-Trilby) said Florida has limited power to intervene with Big Tech, emphasizing the need for congressional action.

"We can't solve this problem on our own," Simpson said. "We need the federal government to step in and break up these monopolies."

The proposed legislation is expected to face legal challenges, with critics arguing that it violates the First Amendment. However, DeSantis has vowed to fight any legal challenges.

"We're not going to back down," DeSantis said. "We're going to protect the First Amendment rights of all Floridians."
