WHO Validates Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 Vaccine for Emergency Use

Geneva, 1 June 2021 - The World Health Organization (WHO) has validated the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, assuring its safety, efficacy, and manufacturing quality. This validation opens the door for the vaccine's inclusion in the COVAX Facility and international procurement.

"This is an important milestone in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic," said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products. "This vaccine has the potential to contribute significantly to the global effort to control the pandemic, particularly in low-resource settings."

The WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) process assesses novel health products during public health emergencies, focusing on safety, efficacy, and quality. The Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine underwent rigorous evaluation, including on-site inspections of its production facility.

The vaccine is suitable for low-resource settings due to its easy storage requirements, which do not require ultra-cold temperatures. It is recommended for adults 18 years and older, with a two-dose schedule.

Vaccine efficacy results showed that it prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of recipients and severe COVID-19 and hospitalization in 100% of the studied population. While efficacy in older adults (over 60 years) could not be estimated from trials, the WHO does not recommend an upper age limit due to supportive data.

"We need multiple vaccines to address the global access inequity," said Dr Simão. "The addition of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine to the COVAX portfolio will help us reach more people and protect them from COVID-19."

The WHO's validation of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine is a significant step forward in the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides assurance that the vaccine meets international standards for safety, efficacy, and manufacturing, and it will contribute to the equitable distribution of vaccines around the world.

About the WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) Process

The EUL process is a risk-based procedure for assessing and listing unlicensed vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics during public health emergencies. The EUL assessment focuses on the safety, efficacy, and quality of the product, as well as its suitability for use in emergency settings.

The EUL process is designed to provide assurance that the product meets minimum requirements for quality, safety, and efficacy, and that it is manufactured under appropriate conditions. The EUL process also includes a risk-benefit assessment, which considers the potential benefits of the product against its potential risks.

The EUL process is an important tool for ensuring the availability of safe and effective health products during public health emergencies. It provides assurance that products have been evaluated by WHO and meet minimum requirements for quality, safety, and efficacy.
