Egypt Seeks Over $1 Billion in Compensation for Suez Canal Blockage

CAIRO – Egyptian authorities are seeking over $1 billion in compensation for the costs incurred in clearing the Ever Given container ship from the Suez Canal, according to Osama Rabie, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA).

"We are calculating the compensation based on the losses we incurred in canal revenue, equipment costs, and manpower," Rabie said.

The Ever Given, a 200,000-ton mega-container carrier, became stuck in the Suez Canal on March 23, blocking the vital waterway for six days and causing a major disruption in international shipping. The incident held up an estimated $9 billion in global trade per day and left 422 vessels waiting to pass through the canal.

Rabie expressed hope for a compensation agreement soon but did not specify who might be liable to pay. The complex ownership and management structure of the Ever Given adds to the challenge of determining responsibility.

First-hand accounts from rescue workers highlighted the dangers and challenges faced in freeing the ship.

"It was a very difficult operation," said Aly Awamy, a mechanic on the Mashhour Dredger. "We had to work day and night to remove the sand and mud that had accumulated around the ship."

"The ship was so big that it was like trying to move a mountain," added Mohammed Sayed, head dredger on the Mashhour Dredger. "We had to use all of our equipment and manpower to get it unstuck."

Youssef Naghi, another dredger, described the moment the ship was finally refloated. "It was an amazing feeling," he said. "We had been working so hard for so long, and it was finally over."

An investigation into the incident is underway, examining potential human and technical errors.

The insurance industry is also closely watching the situation. Brian Schneider, senior director of the insurance division of Fitch Ratings, said that losses are estimated to be in the low hundreds of millions of dollars.

"The Ever Given is one of the largest container ships in the world, and its blockage of the Suez Canal caused a significant disruption to global trade," Schneider said. "This incident is a reminder of the importance of marine insurance and the potential for large losses in the shipping industry."

A spokesperson for Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the operator of the Ever Given, said that the company is in discussions with the SCA about compensation but declined to provide specifics.

"We are committed to working with the SCA to resolve this matter amicably," the spokesperson said.

The owner of the Ever Given, Shoei Kisen, has also not provided any details on compensation.
