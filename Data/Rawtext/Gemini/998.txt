Facebook Removes Trump Interview Video, Citing Ban on Former President

Facebook has removed a video featuring an interview with former President Donald Trump, citing its ongoing ban on the former commander-in-chief. The video was posted by Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law, who shared emails from Facebook explaining the removal of the content.

Facebook's ban on Donald Trump was enacted on January 7, following the insurrection at the US Capitol. The ban was justified by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg due to the risks of allowing Trump to use the service during the period leading up to the inauguration.

Facebook confirmed to CNBC and The Verge that it removed the video. The company declined to comment further.

The ban on Trump has been a controversial issue, with some arguing that it is necessary to prevent further violence and misinformation, while others believe it is an infringement on free speech.

Facebook's independent oversight board is currently reviewing the ban on Trump. The board has the power to overturn Facebook's decision, but it is not clear when it will make a ruling.

Twitter has also permanently banned Trump, including if he runs for office again in 2024.

Criticism of tech industry's content moderation practices is a bipartisan issue, with different reasons from conservatives and Democrats. Conservatives accuse social media platforms of discriminating against right-wing content, while Democrats argue that the platforms need to do more to combat hate speech and misinformation.

The removal of the Trump interview video is likely to further fuel the debate over content moderation on social media. It remains to be seen how Facebook's oversight board will rule on the ban on Trump, and whether other social media platforms will follow suit.

In the meantime, the removal of the video is a reminder of the ongoing debate over the role of social media in society and the challenges of balancing free speech with the need to prevent harm.
