U.S. Drone Strike Targets IS Member in Afghanistan in Retaliation for Kabul Attack

In a swift response to the deadly suicide bombing at Kabul airport, the U.S. military has conducted a drone strike in Afghanistan, targeting an Islamic State (IS) member believed to be planning further attacks against American forces.

Drone Strike Neutralizes IS Threat

"The strike was conducted in Nangahar province, Afghanistan, on August 29, 2021, at approximately 6:18 a.m. local time," said Navy Capt. William Urban, spokesman for U.S. Central Command. "The strike targeted an individual who was an ISIS-K planner and facilitator. We are confident we successfully hit the target."

Urban confirmed that the strike killed one individual and reported no civilian casualties. The strike was authorized by President Joe Biden and ordered by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

Retaliation for Kabul Airport Attack

The drone strike comes in retaliation for the suicide bombing at Kabul airport on August 26, which killed up to 169 Afghans and 13 American service members. The attack was claimed by IS.

"This strike was a necessary and appropriate response to the heinous attack on our troops and innocent civilians in Kabul," said Maj. Gen. Hank Taylor, deputy director for regional operations for the Pentagon's Joint Staff. "We will continue to take all necessary measures to protect our forces and our interests in Afghanistan."

Targeted Individual's Involvement in Kabul Attack

It is not yet confirmed whether the targeted individual was directly involved in the Kabul airport suicide bombing. However, Urban stated that the individual was "an ISIS-K planner and facilitator" and was "actively planning attacks against U.S. forces in Kabul."

MQ-9 Reaper Drone Used

The drone strike was executed using an MQ-9 Reaper drone, which is known for its precision and ability to minimize potential civilian casualties.

Biden's Vow to Retaliate

The strike follows President Biden's vow to retaliate against the perpetrators of the Kabul attack. "We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay," Biden said in a televised address.

Security Alert for U.S. Citizens in Kabul

The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has issued a security alert advising U.S. citizens to avoid airport gates due to security threats.

Threat of Another Terror Attack

President Biden has been warned that another terror attack in Kabul is "likely" as the U.S. approaches its deadline for military withdrawal on August 31.

U.S. Commitment to Afghanistan

Despite the ongoing security challenges, the U.S. remains committed to completing its mission in Afghanistan. "We will continue to work with our partners to evacuate American citizens, Afghan allies, and other vulnerable individuals," said Taylor. "We will also continue to support the Afghan people and their efforts to build a stable and secure future."
