Biden Inherits Trump's Iran-Focused Social Media Campaign

Washington, D.C. - The Biden administration is inheriting a robust Iran-focused social media campaign from the Trump administration, which sought to engage Iranians by criticizing their rulers and exerting "maximum pressure" on the country's clerics.

Under Trump, the State Department's Farsi-language Instagram account saw a surge in followers, from 147,000 in January 2019 to 759,000 in January 2021. The campaign utilized various social media channels and messages to amplify its message.

"We were trying to get the Iranian people to understand that we were on their side, that we were supporting them, and that we wanted to see a change in their government," said Gabriel Noronha, former manager of the State Department's Farsi social media channels.

Instagram is accessible in Iran, while Facebook and Twitter are blocked but can be accessed via VPNs. The most engaging posts supported calls for anti-government protests and celebrated pre-Islamic Revolution Iranian cultural traditions.

Trump's Farsi tweets, particularly in support of Iranian protests, drew significant attention and likes. In November 2019, he tweeted, "To the brave, long-suffering people of Iran: I have stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency, and my Administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage."

Iran's Foreign Ministry responded negatively to Trump's tweets, criticizing the use of the Persian language in them. "The use of Persian language in Trump's tweets is a sign of his desperation and his failure to understand the Iranian people," said Abbas Mousavi, then-Foreign Ministry spokesman.

The Trump administration's social media strategy built upon efforts started under the Obama administration, which launched a Farsi-language website and social media accounts in 2011.

Critics and observers note that Trump's approach was more aggressive and sometimes dismissed or mocked by Iranians. "Trump's tweets were often seen as condescending and out of touch with the realities of life in Iran," said Nazenin Ansari, managing editor of Kayhan London and Kayhan Life.

There is concern that the Biden administration's shift in approach might overlook human rights abuses in Iran. "The Biden administration needs to find a way to balance its desire to engage with Iran with its commitment to human rights," said Holly Dagres, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.

Alireza Nader, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, believes that the Biden administration should continue to use social media to engage with Iranians. "Social media is a powerful tool that can be used to promote democracy and human rights," he said.

The Biden administration is reviewing the Trump administration's Iran-focused social media campaign and is expected to make changes in the coming months. It remains to be seen how the new administration will use social media to engage with Iranians and promote its policy goals.

Conclusion:

The Biden administration is inheriting a robust Iran-focused social media campaign from the Trump administration. The campaign has been used to engage with Iranians, promote U.S. policy goals, and support the Iranian people's right to protest. The Biden administration is expected to make changes to the campaign in the coming months, but it is likely to continue to use social media as a tool to engage with Iranians and promote its policy goals.
