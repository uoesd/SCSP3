Injured Kabul Airport Bombing Victims Find Solace in US

CNN – Ahmad Faisal, 13, and Mina, 7, two young victims of the horrific Kabul airport suicide bombing, have finally arrived in the United States for much-needed medical treatment. Their aunt, Ferishta, described their reunion as "the best day of my life."

The children's family had desperately attempted to flee Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover, but tragedy struck during the ISIS-K attack. Ahmad Faisal and Mina were separated from their older brother and father in the ensuing chaos. Heartbreakingly, their mother succumbed to her injuries in the terrorist attack.

Ahmad Faisal and Mina were evacuated to Germany with a neighbor before being brought to the US. Tragically, they remain unaware of their mother's passing. Ferishta, a US citizen, has made the difficult decision to wait until they are settled with family in the US before informing them of their devastating loss.

Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. John Bradley, who runs the Lamia Afghan Foundation, played a pivotal role in assisting Ferishta and feels a deep sense of responsibility for the family's situation. "I feel responsible for them," Bradley said. "I sent them documents that led them to the airport at the time of the attack."

Bradley's efforts are now focused on reuniting the entire family in Virginia with Ferishta. "We're working to get the father and the other brother here," he said.

Ferishta's heart overflows with gratitude for the outpouring of support she has received. "I'm so thankful to everyone who has helped us," she said. "We're just trying to take it one day at a time."

Ahmad Faisal and Mina are now receiving specialized medical care at a hospital in Virginia. Their injuries, while severe, are expected to heal with time. Ferishta remains hopeful that her family will find peace and healing in the United States.

"I'm just so happy to have them here," she said. "They're my everything."

Ferishta's Journey of Hope and Resilience

Ferishta's journey to reunite with her family has been marked by both unimaginable pain and unwavering determination. After learning of the bombing, she frantically searched for her loved ones, fearing the worst.

"I couldn't believe it," she said. "I thought I had lost them forever."

When she finally received word that Ahmad Faisal and Mina had survived, a glimmer of hope emerged amidst the darkness. However, the realization that her sister had been killed shattered her heart.

"It's still so hard to believe that she's gone," Ferishta said. "She was such a wonderful mother."

Despite her grief, Ferishta remains focused on providing a safe and loving home for her niece and nephew. She is grateful for the support of her community and the medical professionals who are caring for Ahmad Faisal and Mina.

"I know we have a long road ahead of us," she said. "But I'm determined to give these children the best life possible."

Bradley's Commitment to Helping Afghan Families

Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. John Bradley has dedicated his post-military career to assisting Afghan families in need. Through the Lamia Afghan Foundation, he has provided support to refugees, orphans, and victims of war.

Bradley's involvement with Ahmad Faisal and Mina's family began when he sent them documents that allowed them to enter the Kabul airport. Tragically, the timing of their arrival coincided with the deadly bombing.

"I feel a deep sense of responsibility for what happened," Bradley said. "I wish I could have done more to protect them."

Bradley is now committed to ensuring that the family receives the support they need to heal and rebuild their lives. He is working tirelessly to reunite them with their father and other brother and to provide them with access to medical care, education, and counseling.

"These children have been through so much," Bradley said. "They deserve a chance to live in peace and happiness."

A Community of Support

Ahmad Faisal and Mina's arrival in the US has been met with an outpouring of support from the community. Neighbors, friends, and strangers alike have reached out to offer their assistance.

A local church has provided the family with a place to stay, while a group of volunteers has organized a fundraiser to help cover their medical expenses.

"We're so grateful for all the help we've received," Ferishta said. "It's truly heartwarming to know that there are so many people who care."

As Ahmad Faisal and Mina begin their recovery, they are surrounded by love and support. Their aunt, Ferishta, is determined to provide them with a stable and nurturing environment where they can heal and thrive.
