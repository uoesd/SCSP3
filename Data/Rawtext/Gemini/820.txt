Disabled Californians Feel Neglected by Golden State Stimulus

As California continues to grapple with the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, many disabled residents feel left behind by the state's Golden State Stimulus program. The stimulus, which has distributed $600 payments to millions of Californians, has largely excluded those who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), a federal program that provides income to individuals with disabilities who are unable to work.

SSDI Recipients Express Frustration

"It's like we're being punished for being disabled," said Janet Clendenin, an SSDI recipient from Sacramento. "We're already struggling financially, and now we're being told we don't qualify for help."

Clendenin, who has multiple sclerosis, relies on SSDI to cover her basic living expenses. She said she was shocked and disappointed when she learned she would not receive a Golden State Stimulus payment.

"I'm not asking for a handout," Clendenin said. "I'm just asking for a little bit of help to get through this difficult time."

1.2 Million Californians on SSDI Excluded

Clendenin is not alone. An estimated 1.2 million Californians on SSDI were skipped by the Golden State Stimulus payments. The stimulus payments were primarily targeted at individuals who had work income in 2020 or who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI), another federal program for low-income individuals with disabilities.

Disability Advocates Criticize State

Disability advocates have criticized California for not adequately supporting its disabled residents during the pandemic.

"Disabled Californians have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic," said Andrew Imparato, Executive Director of Disability Rights California. "They are more likely to live in poverty, have underlying health conditions, and face barriers to accessing essential services."

Imparato said the exclusion of SSDI recipients from the Golden State Stimulus is a "clear example of how the state is failing to meet the needs of its most vulnerable residents."

Logistical Challenges Cited

H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for the Department of Finance, said there were logistical challenges in including SSDI recipients in the stimulus payments.

"We do not have access to federal records that would allow us to verify the income and eligibility of SSDI recipients," Palmer said.

Palmer said the state is working on ways to include SSDI recipients in future stimulus payments, but he did not provide a timeline.

SSDI Recipients Face Financial Hardships

Despite the exclusion, SSDI recipients often face significant financial hardships. Many live in poverty and deal with additional medical expenses.

"SSDI is not a lot of money," said Charis Hill, a disabled activist from Oakland. "It's barely enough to cover my rent and food."

Hill managed to qualify for the Golden State Stimulus by filing taxes for freelance work she did in 2020. However, she said she knows many other SSDI recipients who were not as fortunate.

"It's not fair that we're being left behind," Hill said. "We need help too."

Caretakers Also Impacted

The exclusion of SSDI recipients from the Golden State Stimulus has also impacted caretakers, who often provide unpaid care to disabled family members.

"My cousin has severe disabilities and relies on me for everything," said Sydney Chandler, a caretaker and writer from Los Angeles. "The Golden State Stimulus would have been a huge help to us."

Chandler said she is angry that the state has excluded SSDI recipients from the stimulus payments.

"It's a slap in the face to disabled people and their families," Chandler said. "We're already struggling, and now the state is making it even harder."

Legislative Effort to Include SSDI Recipients

There is some legislative effort to include SSDI recipients in future stimulus payments. Assemblymember Miguel Santiago (D-Los Angeles) has introduced a bill that would expand the Golden State Stimulus to include SSDI recipients.

The bill is currently in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

Stimulus Program Has Evolved

The Golden State Stimulus program has evolved since it was first announced by Governor Gavin Newsom in January. The initial payments were $600, but they were later increased to $1,200 for individuals who filed their taxes jointly.

The program has also been expanded to include undocumented immigrants and incarcerated individuals.

Conclusion

Despite the changes and expansions, the Golden State Stimulus program continues to exclude SSDI recipients. Disability advocates and caretakers are calling on the state to address this issue and provide financial assistance to disabled Californians who are struggling during the pandemic.
