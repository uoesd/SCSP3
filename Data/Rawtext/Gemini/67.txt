Raskin Leads Charge to Remove Trump, Citing Capitol Riot and Son's Death

In the wake of the deadly Capitol riot and the tragic loss of his son, Representative Jamie Raskin (D-MD) has emerged as a vocal advocate for removing President Donald Trump from office. As the House's lead manager for Trump's upcoming impeachment trial, Raskin is determined to hold the president accountable for his actions.

Impeachment and the 25th Amendment

Democrats are actively considering both impeachment and invoking the 25th Amendment as means to remove Trump from office. Raskin supports both options, emphasizing the urgency of removing Trump from power.

"We have to act now," Raskin said in an interview with ABC News. "Trump is a clear and present danger to our democracy."

Raskin believes that impeachment is the most appropriate course of action, as it would allow the Senate to hold a trial and potentially remove Trump from office. However, he also recognizes that the 25th Amendment could provide a bipartisan solution, as it would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Trump unfit for office.

Capitol Insurrection and Trump's Responsibility

Raskin was present at the Capitol during the insurrection, along with his daughter and son-in-law. He witnessed firsthand the violence and chaos that unfolded, and he holds Trump directly responsible for inciting the mob.

"Trump is the one who whipped up this mob," Raskin said. "He is the one who told them to march on the Capitol and 'fight like hell.'"

Raskin is particularly concerned about the possibility of Trump pardoning those involved in the Capitol siege. He believes that such a move would be a travesty of justice and would send a dangerous message that violence against our democracy will be tolerated.

Personal Impact of Capitol Events

The Capitol events have had a profound impact on Raskin and his family. His son, Tommy, died by suicide just days before the insurrection. Raskin has said that the events of January 6th have made his grief even more difficult to bear.

"I'm still trying to process everything that has happened," Raskin said. "But I know that we cannot let Trump get away with this. We have to hold him accountable for his actions."

Senate's Failure to Convict Trump

Raskin is critical of the Senate's failure to convict Trump during his first impeachment trial. He believes that the Senate abdicated its responsibility to hold the president accountable for his actions.

"The Senate had a chance to remove Trump from office, and they failed," Raskin said. "We cannot let that happen again."

Urgency of Removing Trump

Raskin believes that it is imperative to remove Trump from office as soon as possible. He fears that if Trump remains in power, he will continue to pose a threat to our democracy.

"Trump is a dangerous man," Raskin said. "He is a threat to our national security, our economy, and our way of life. We have to get him out of office now."
