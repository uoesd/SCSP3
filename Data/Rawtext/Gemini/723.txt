School Threats Surge in Wake of Oxford Shooting, Spurring Arrests and Warnings

DETROIT – In the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Oxford High School, a disturbing trend of "copycat" threats against schools has emerged, leading to dozens of arrests and charges against students, including children as young as 9.

In metro Detroit alone, at least two dozen students have been taken into custody or charged in recent days for making threats of violence. Authorities are issuing stern warnings about the serious consequences of making threats, even in jest.

"We're taking these threats very seriously," said Waterford Police Chief Scott Underwood. "We want to make it clear that there will be consequences for anyone who makes a threat against a school."

In Waterford, four students, including two 9-year-olds, were detained for making threats and creating concerning lists. Two middle school students in Waterford have been charged with making a false threat of terrorism, potentially facing 20 years in prison.

"These are not just pranks," Underwood said. "These are serious threats that can have real-world consequences."

Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy reported charging 18 youths in recent days for related crimes. She stressed the need for community effort to address the issue.

"We need parents to talk to their children about the seriousness of making threats," Worthy said. "We need to make sure that our children understand that there are consequences for their actions."

Worthy's office has been working to educate parents and students on the risks since 2018. She emphasized the need to confront access to guns and their portrayal.

"We need to have a conversation about how we can reduce the number of guns in our communities," Worthy said. "We need to talk about how we can change the way that guns are portrayed in the media."

The Oakland County Sheriff's Office is investigating a note found in a high school, though it appears not to constitute a credible threat.

"We are taking every threat seriously," said Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard. "We want to make sure that our schools are safe for our children."

The surge in school threats has raised concerns about the mental health of students. Experts say that the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent school shooting may have contributed to the increase in threats.

"We need to make sure that our children have access to mental health services," said Dr. Frank McGeorge, a child psychologist. "We need to let them know that it's okay to ask for help."

Parents are urged to talk to their children about the seriousness of making threats. They should also be aware of the signs of mental health problems and seek help if they are concerned.

"We need to work together to keep our schools safe," Worthy said. "We need to make sure that our children know that there are consequences for their actions."
