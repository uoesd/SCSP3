Oakland County Prosecutor: Michigan School Shooting Could Have Been Prevented

Oxford, Michigan - A week after a tragic school shooting that claimed the lives of four students at Oxford High School, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald has asserted that the incident could have been averted if the suspect's parents had been more forthcoming about his access to firearms.

Suspect and Parental Charges

Ethan Crumbley, a 15-year-old sophomore, is accused of carrying out the shooting on November 30, 2021. His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, have been charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter for their alleged role in the tragedy.

Prosecutors allege that James Crumbley purchased the 9mm Sig Sauer SP 2022 pistol used in the shooting just four days prior to the incident. Jennifer Crumbley is accused of posting about the gun on social media, stating, "My son is home for the weekend on holidays. Let's target practice."

Missed Warning Signs

The day before the shooting, school officials and Crumbley's parents met to discuss concerning drawings and statements made by the suspect. However, he was allowed to return to class despite these red flags.

"The school missed multiple warning signs," said Casey Smith, a parent of an Oxford High student. "They should have searched his backpack, where we believe the firearm was during the meeting."

School's Response and Criticism

Following the incident, Oxford High has announced plans for a "soft opening" on December 6, 2021, with law enforcement present and trained clinicians available to support students.

However, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel expressed disappointment in the school district's decision to hire a private security firm for a safety review instead of accepting the state's offer.

"The state has a team of experts who could have conducted a thorough and independent review," Nessel said. "It's concerning that the school district chose not to take advantage of this resource."

Parents' Detention and Search Warrant

James and Jennifer Crumbley are being held at the Oakland County Jail, separated from each other and their son to avoid interaction.

A search warrant was executed at the home of Andrzej Sikora, who is believed to have helped the Crumbleys hide before their arrest.

"Mr. Sikora did not assist the Crumbleys in evading law enforcement nor was he aware of their warrants at the time of their use of his workspace," said Clarence Dass, Sikora's attorney.

Legal Proceedings

Paulette Michel Loftin, the court-appointed attorney for Ethan Crumbley, has entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. A probable cause conference is scheduled for December 13, 2021.

Oakland County Undersheriff Michael G. McCabe stated that the investigation into the shooting is ongoing and that additional charges may be filed.

Expert Analysis

Chris Dorn, a senior analyst at Safe Havens International, a school safety consulting firm, emphasized the importance of comprehensive threat assessment protocols in preventing school shootings.

"Schools need to have a system in place to identify and respond to students who may pose a threat to themselves or others," Dorn said.

Superintendent's Statement

Oxford Community Schools Superintendent Tim Throne acknowledged the concerns raised by parents and the community.

"We are committed to providing a safe and supportive learning environment for our students," Throne said. "We will continue to work with law enforcement and mental health professionals to ensure that our school is a safe place for all."

Sheriff's Perspective

Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard emphasized the need for accountability in the wake of the tragedy.

"We must hold those responsible for this senseless act accountable," Bouchard said. "We will continue to investigate this incident thoroughly and pursue justice for the victims and their families."

Community Response

The Oxford community has been reeling from the shooting, with residents expressing shock, grief, and anger.

"This is a tragedy that could have been prevented," said Casey Smith. "We need to do everything we can to ensure that something like this never happens again."

Conclusion

The Oakland County Prosecutor's assertion that the Oxford High School shooting could have been prevented has raised questions about the adequacy of school safety protocols and the role of parents in preventing gun violence. As the investigation continues and legal proceedings unfold, the community grapples with the aftermath of this devastating tragedy.
