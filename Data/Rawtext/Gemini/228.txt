Cybersecurity: A Critical Infrastructure Imperative

The recent ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, a major U.S. fuel pipeline, has once again brought the issue of cybersecurity to the forefront. This attack, perpetrated by hackers operating from Russia, is part of a growing trend of cyber-attacks targeting companies, federal agencies, and municipalities in the United States.

The Colonial Pipeline attack highlights the vulnerability of our critical infrastructure to cyber threats. Eighty-five percent of American critical infrastructure is privately owned, with limited direct governmental protection against cyber threats. This means that the responsibility for protecting our critical infrastructure largely falls on the private sector.

While federal agencies like the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) play roles in cyber-defense, no single agency is tasked with protecting the public from hackers. This lack of a centralized authority has led to gaps in our cyber-defense capabilities.

In 2012, a bill to establish security standards for critical infrastructure failed in the Senate, highlighting the legislative gaps in cyber-defense. Experts advocate for more government-corporation collaboration and information sharing to improve cyber-defense.

"The government needs to do a better job of sharing information with the private sector about cyber threats," said Glenn Gerstell, the recent former NSA general counsel. "And the private sector needs to do a better job of reporting cyber incidents to the government."

Legislation is also needed to protect companies from liability when disclosing hacks, encouraging them to report incidents promptly. Companies negligent in protecting customer data or critical infrastructure should face liability.

The Biden administration's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan includes funds to address critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. This is a positive step, but more needs to be done to ensure that our critical infrastructure is protected from cyber threats.

The proliferation of 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) devices increases the importance of robust cyber-defense. These devices are often connected to critical infrastructure, making them potential targets for hackers.

"The increasing interconnectedness of our world means that cyber-attacks can have a ripple effect, disrupting critical infrastructure and causing economic damage," said Gerstell. "We need to take steps now to improve our cyber-defense capabilities."

The Colonial Pipeline attack is a wake-up call. We can no longer afford to be complacent about cybersecurity. We need to take action now to protect our critical infrastructure from cyber threats.
