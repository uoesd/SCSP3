Special Lockdown Locks Credited with Saving Lives in Oxford High School Shooting

Oxford, Michigan - The special lockdown locks installed at Oxford High School four years ago likely saved lives during last week's shooting spree, according to law enforcement officials.

The locks, designed by Nightlock in Mt. Morris, Michigan, have been sold to approximately 10,000 school districts nationwide. The locking device features a red handle that can be inserted into the door from a wall-mounted box, preventing entry. The locks are designed to keep doors secured even if the glass is broken and someone tries to unlock the door from the outside.

Oxford High School installed a variety of these locks in 2017, suitable for both inward and outward swinging doors. The alleged shooter did not enter any classrooms, with all casualties occurring in the hallways.

"These locks likely saved lives," said Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard. "They prevented the shooter from entering classrooms and harming more students."

Bouchard praised Oxford Community Schools for their safety precautions and training protocols. "The school district had a plan in place, and they executed it flawlessly," he said.

Cris Ahearn, Director of Sales at Nightlock, expressed emotional distress over the incident. "It's heartbreaking to know that this happened," he said. "We design these locks to protect people, and it's devastating to think that they weren't enough."

Ahearn emphasized the limitations of locking devices in protecting individuals in hallways. "Locks can only do so much," he said. "They can't prevent someone from shooting through a window or attacking people in the hallways."

Nightlock has experienced increased inquiries from districts seeking to enhance facility security following the shooting. "We're getting calls from all over the country," Ahearn said. "People are scared, and they want to know what they can do to protect their students."

Nightlock's creation was initially inspired by a home invasion at the owners' parents' house. After the Sandy Hook shooting, the company shifted its focus to developing school security devices.

"We want to make sure that no other school has to go through what Oxford did," Ahearn said. "We're committed to providing schools with the best possible security solutions."

The Oxford High School shooting has reignited the debate over school safety. Some experts argue that more armed security guards are needed in schools, while others believe that a focus on mental health and early intervention is more effective.

"There is no one-size-fits-all solution to school safety," Bouchard said. "We need to look at all of the options and find the best way to protect our students."

In the meantime, Nightlock's special lockdown locks are providing schools with an additional layer of security. "We can't prevent every tragedy," Ahearn said. "But we can do everything we can to make sure that our schools are as safe as possible."
