US Withdrawal Marks End of Two Decades in Afghanistan

The United States and its allies launched airstrikes against Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan on October 7, 2001, in response to the September 11 attacks. The Taliban, who had been in control of Afghanistan since the Soviet occupation and subsequent civil war, refused to surrender Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the attacks. The airstrikes targeted Kabul, Kandahar, and Jalalabad, destroying the Taliban's defense capabilities.

After the airstrikes, the US and its allies worked with Afghan opposition groups to establish a new Afghan government. A new constitution was drafted and approved in 2004, leading to presidential elections in October of that year. Hamid Karzai was elected as the first president of the new Afghan government.

NATO took over combat operations in Afghanistan in 2003, and the US shifted its focus to training and supporting Afghan security forces. However, the war continued, and the Taliban gradually regained control of parts of the country. In 2014, NATO ended its combat operations in Afghanistan, and the US began to withdraw its troops.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani reported in 2019 that over 45,000 members of the country's security forces had died since 2014, a higher figure than previously known. The war has also taken a heavy toll on Afghan civilians.

On April 14, 2021, US President Joe Biden announced that all US troops would be withdrawn from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. "It is time to end America's longest war," Biden said.

The withdrawal of US troops marks a significant shift in the US's involvement in Afghanistan. The war has been costly in terms of both lives and money, and it has not achieved all of its objectives. The withdrawal of US troops will leave the Afghan government to face the Taliban on its own. It remains to be seen whether the Afghan government will be able to maintain control of the country without US support.
