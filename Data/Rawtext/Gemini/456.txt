'Harry & Meghan: Escaping the Palace' Explores the Sussexes' Journey Beyond Royal Life

Lifetime's highly anticipated movie, "Harry & Meghan: Escaping the Palace," has finally premiered, offering a glimpse into the couple's tumultuous journey as they navigate the complexities of leaving royal life. The film, which combines tabloid stories with Harry and Meghan's personal account, spans the period from after Archie's birth to the aftermath of the bombshell Oprah interview.

Dramatizing Events and Adding Fiction

While the movie attempts to stay true to the couple's experiences, it also dramatizes events and adds fictional elements to real-life incidents. For instance, the film depicts the couple's discomfort at Trooping the Colour 2019, a stark contrast to their actual situation according to royal protocol.

"The reality is that they were very much part of the family at that point," said Joe Little, Managing Editor of Majesty magazine. "They were still very much working royals."

Meghan's Mental Health Struggles

The film also delves into Meghan's mental health struggles and suicidal thoughts, which she shared in the Oprah interview. These experiences are paralleled with Princess Diana's own struggles, highlighting the challenges faced by women within the royal family.

"I was ashamed to admit it to Harry," Meghan says in the film. "But I knew if I didn't say it, I would do it."

Dramatizing the Sussexes' Final Royal Appearance

The movie dramatizes the Sussexes' final royal appearance at the Commonwealth Day service in March 2020, suggesting tension and reconciliation among the royals that was not confirmed in real life.

"It's a very emotional scene," said Sydney Morton, who portrays Meghan in the movie. "It's a moment where they're saying goodbye to the life they've known."

Move to Los Angeles and Tyler Perry's Assistance

The film also covers the Sussexes' move from Canada to Los Angeles at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, including Tyler Perry's assistance in providing them with a safe haven.

"Tyler Perry was a huge help to them," said a source close to the couple. "He gave them a place to stay and helped them get settled in."

Underrepresented Oprah Interview

Despite the Oprah interview being a pivotal event in the Sussexes' journey, it was surprisingly underrepresented in the film.

"I think they wanted to focus on the events leading up to the interview," said a source close to the production. "The interview itself was just a small part of their story."

Reality Check from People Magazine

People magazine provides a reality check on these dramatized events, offering insights from sources close to the royals.

"The film is a dramatization of events," said a source. "It's not a documentary."

Sensitive Topics Explored

The film touches on sensitive topics like mental health, royal family dynamics, and the couple's search for independence.

"It's a very personal story," said Morton. "It's a story about love, loss, and finding your own way."

Conclusion

"Harry & Meghan: Escaping the Palace" offers a dramatized glimpse into the Sussexes' tumultuous journey as they navigate the complexities of leaving royal life. While the film takes some creative liberties, it touches on sensitive topics and provides insights into the couple's personal experiences.
