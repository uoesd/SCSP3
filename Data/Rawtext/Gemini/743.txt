Baldwin's Attorney Denies Trigger Pull in 'Rust' Shooting

NEW YORK – Attorney Lisa Torraco, representing Dave Halls, the first assistant director on the set of the film "Rust," has asserted that actor Alec Baldwin did not pull the trigger on the prop gun that fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

"Mr. Baldwin did not pull the trigger," Torraco stated. "He was handed a gun that he was told was safe, and he relied on the professionals on the set to ensure that it was."

Baldwin echoed this claim in a recent interview with ABC News, stating, "I didn't pull the trigger. I would never point a gun at anyone and pull the trigger at them. Never."

The tragic incident occurred on October 21, 2021, during a dress rehearsal at Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe, New Mexico. Hutchins was fatally shot, and director Joel Souza was injured when the gun Baldwin was holding discharged.

The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office has identified Gutierrez-Reed, the film's armorer, and Halls as the individuals who handled the gun before the incident.

"This was a freak, awful accident," Torraco emphasized. "Dave is heartbroken. He is devastated by what happened."

No charges have been filed at this time, but Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies has stated, "Everything is on the table" regarding potential charges.

Investigators have searched a gun store for additional details but have not yet confirmed the source of the live rounds used.

Two related ABC specials will air discussing the "Rust" shooting and featuring interviews with Baldwin and others involved.

According to a search warrant affidavit, Halls communicated a "cold gun" to the crew, indicating that the firearm supposedly had no live rounds.

Sheriff Adan Mendoza stated, "We're still investigating the exact circumstances surrounding the incident, and we're working to determine how live rounds got onto the set."

Carmack-Altwies added, "We're not going to rush to judgment. We're going to take our time and make sure we do a thorough investigation."

The investigation is ongoing, and further details are expected to emerge in the coming weeks.
