Biden Inauguration Proceeds Safely Amid Heightened Security

WASHINGTON (AP) – Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday without any major security incidents, despite heightened concerns following the January 6 attack on the Capitol by rioters loyal to Donald Trump.

Law enforcement agencies had been monitoring far-right extremist and militia groups for potential threats in the lead-up to the inauguration. Over 25,000 troops and police were deployed to secure the event, and the National Mall was closed with extensive checkpoints.

"We were very concerned about the potential for violence and disruption," said Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau. "We took every possible precaution to ensure that the inauguration would be safe and secure."

Despite the heavy security presence, there were only a few scattered arrests and no major protests. Federal agents had been wary of concerning online chatter and possible infiltration attempts, but no such incidents occurred.

QAnon followers, who had been predicting a "storm" of violence and the arrest of Biden and other Democrats, expressed disappointment online as their conspiracy theories did not materialize.

"This is a major setback for the QAnon movement," said a former FBI agent who has been tracking the group. "They have been predicting this event for months, and it has turned out to be a complete dud."

Twelve National Guard members were removed from their duties due to extremist statements or ties to right-wing militias. The FBI vetted all 25,000 National Guard members in an unprecedented security effort.

"We wanted to make sure that there were no potential threats within the ranks of the National Guard," said a senior FBI official. "We took every possible step to ensure the safety of the inauguration."

Security in Washington, D.C., is expected to remain heightened for several days post-inauguration. The Capitol building remains closed to the public, and there are still a large number of troops and police patrolling the city.

"We are not taking any chances," said a spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police. "We want to make sure that the city is safe and secure for all residents and visitors."

The peaceful inauguration of Joe Biden is a testament to the resilience of American democracy and the hard work of law enforcement agencies. Despite the heightened security concerns, the event proceeded without any major incidents, ensuring a smooth transition of power.
