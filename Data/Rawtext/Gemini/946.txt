Cassidy 'at Peace' with Impeachment Vote, Despite GOP Censure

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) – U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy says he feels "at peace" with his vote to convict former President Donald Trump at his impeachment trial, despite facing criticism and censure from the Louisiana Republican Party.

Cassidy was one of seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. His vote diverged from Louisiana's other U.S. senator, John Kennedy, who voted against conviction.

"I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution," Cassidy said in an interview with The Associated Press. "I believe that the evidence presented in the trial showed that President Trump had incited an insurrection against the United States, and I voted to convict him accordingly."

Cassidy's vote drew swift backlash from the Louisiana Republican Party, which voted to censure him and called for his resignation. However, Cassidy believes this does not represent the broader party opinion.

"I think the Republican Party is a big tent party," he said. "There are a lot of different views within the party, and I don't think the censure resolution represents the views of all Republicans."

Cassidy has received support and respect from some Republicans for his decision. Former President George W. Bush praised Cassidy's "courage and principle" in a statement.

"I believe that Senator Cassidy's vote was a courageous and principled stand," Bush said. "He put his country before his party, and I commend him for his service."

Despite the backlash, Cassidy has sought to focus on other issues, including Biden's cabinet confirmations and weather recovery efforts. He recently visited areas of Louisiana affected by Hurricane Ida and met with local officials to discuss recovery efforts.

"I'm not going to let the censure resolution distract me from my work," Cassidy said. "I'm going to continue to focus on the needs of the people of Louisiana."

Trump supporters continue to criticize Cassidy, leading to calls for his exclusion from Republican events and more local GOP groups condemning his vote. However, Cassidy remains defiant.

"I'm not going to be intimidated by these attacks," he said. "I'm going to continue to stand up for what I believe is right."

The 57-43 Senate vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump. Some Republicans who acquitted Trump disputed the evidence or rejected Congress's jurisdiction over a former president.

Cassidy said he understands that some people disagree with his vote, but he believes he made the right decision.

"I know that some people are angry with me, but I hope that over time they will come to understand why I voted the way I did," he said. "I believe that I did the right thing, and I'm at peace with my decision."
