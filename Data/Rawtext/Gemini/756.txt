'The Rookie' Bans Live Weapons After 'Rust' Tragedy

CNN – In the wake of the fatal shooting on the set of "Rust," ABC's "The Rookie" has announced a ban on the use of live weapons.

Showrunner Alexi Hawley issued a letter to the cast and crew on Thursday, stating, "After the tragic incident on the 'Rust' set, we have decided to ban the use of live weapons on our show."

The decision was influenced by the October 21 incident where cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was injured after actor Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun that contained live rounds.

"The safety of our cast and crew is our top priority," Hawley wrote. "We are committed to creating a safe work environment and will continue to review our safety protocols."

Airsoft guns will now be used on "The Rookie," with effects added in post-production. Weapons expert Ben Simmons categorizes prop guns into three types: fake, deactivated, and real firearms.

"Fake guns are made of rubber or plastic and cannot fire any type of projectile," Simmons said. "Deactivated guns have had their firing mechanisms removed and are incapable of firing live rounds. Real firearms are capable of firing live rounds and should only be used by trained professionals."

Hawley emphasized the importance of cast and crew safety in his decision. "We cannot afford to take any chances when it comes to the safety of our people," he said.

CNN has reached out to ABC and "The Rookie" representatives for comment.

The investigation into the "Rust" shooting incident is still ongoing. Baldwin has stated that he was told the prop gun was a "cold gun," meaning it did not contain live rounds. Assistant director David Halls has admitted to unknowingly handing Baldwin a gun with live rounds.

"I checked the gun three times," Halls said. "I didn't see any live rounds."

The incident has raised questions about the safety protocols on film sets. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) has called for stricter gun safety measures, including the use of fake or deactivated guns whenever possible.

The ban on live weapons on "The Rookie" is a step in the right direction towards ensuring the safety of cast and crew on film sets.
