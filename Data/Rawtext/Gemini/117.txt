Texas ICU Nurse Fears for Lives Amid Eased Covid-19 Restrictions

CNN – Brittany Smart, an ICU nurse in Texas, is exhausted and scared. Despite the state's recent lifting of the statewide mask mandate and capacity limits on businesses, Covid-19 cases and deaths continue to rise.

"I'm afraid," Smart told CNN. "I'm afraid for my patients. I'm afraid for my colleagues. I'm afraid for my family."

Smart's concerns are shared by many health care workers across the state. While vaccinations have helped reduce the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths, the lifting of restrictions is seen as premature.

"We're not out of the woods yet," said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "The steep decline in cases is leveling off at very high numbers."

In the past week, the US has averaged over 65,000 new Covid-19 cases daily. Texas alone reported more than 6,600 new cases and over 270 deaths in a single day. More than 5,600 Covid-19 patients are currently hospitalized in the state.

"People are still dying," Smart said. "Just because the hospitals aren't as overcrowded doesn't mean Covid-19 is gone."

Experts warn that the easing of restrictions could lead to a surge in cases, especially with highly contagious variants circulating in the US.

"We're concerned about the potential for a fourth wave," Walensky said. "We're not out of this pandemic yet."

Smart's biggest fear is that more lives will be lost as a result of the eased restrictions.

"I don't want to see any more people die," she said. "We've come too far to give up now."

Health care workers are urging Texans to continue wearing masks, social distancing, and getting vaccinated.

"We're not asking for much," Smart said. "We're just asking people to do their part to protect themselves and others."

The Texas Department of State Health Services has issued a statement saying that it is "closely monitoring the situation" and will "take appropriate action if necessary."

However, Smart and other health care workers believe that more needs to be done to prevent a surge in cases.

"We need the governor to reinstate the mask mandate and capacity limits," Smart said. "We need people to take this seriously."

Until then, Smart and her colleagues will continue to work tirelessly to care for Covid-19 patients.

"We're not going to give up," she said. "We're going to keep fighting until this pandemic is over."
