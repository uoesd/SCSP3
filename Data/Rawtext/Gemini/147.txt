Hannity's Fox News Show Dominates Cable News Ratings

Sean Hannity's show on Fox News Channel emerged as the most-watched cable news program last week, attracting an average of 3.7 million viewers. Hannity's show slightly surpassed Tucker Carlson Tonight, which drew 3.6 million viewers.

Hannity also maintained his lead in the coveted 25-54 age demographic, with 669,000 viewers. Tucker Carlson Tonight was a close second with 654,000 viewers in the key demographic.

Fox News Channel continued its dominance among cable news networks, boasting an average total audience of 2.980 million viewers for the week of August 16 through 22. This outperformed not only CNN and MSNBC but also the broadcast networks in prime time.

Other top-performing shows on Fox included The Five, The Ingraham Angle, and Special Report with Bret Baier. Chris Cuomo's return to CNN's Cuomo Prime Time resulted in a total audience of 1.076 million viewers, a 28% decline from the previous week. Cuomo Prime Time also experienced a reduction of more than 30% in viewership in the 25-54 age demographic.

CNN saw a significant drop in women viewers for Cuomo Prime Time, with a 30% decrease for the week. This decline in viewership suggests that Cuomo's return to the network has not yet resonated with the audience.
