Tiger Woods Undergoes Emergency Surgery After Rollover Crash in Los Angeles

Los Angeles, California - Golf legend Tiger Woods underwent emergency surgery Tuesday morning after a single-vehicle rollover crash in Los Angeles. Woods was the sole occupant of the vehicle, which sustained "major damage," according to authorities.

The crash occurred around 7:12 a.m. PST in the upscale Rolling Hills Estates neighborhood. First responders had to extricate Woods from the wreckage using the "jaws of life."

"Mr. Woods suffered significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity," said Dr. Anish Mahajan, Chief Medical Officer and Interim CEO of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where Woods was transported. "Comminuted open fractures affecting both the upper and lower portions of the tibia and fibula bones were stabilized by inserting a rod into the tibia."

Woods is reportedly awake and responsive following the surgery.

"Tiger Woods is currently awake, responsive, and recovering in his hospital room," Mahajan said. "He is currently receiving treatment and is under the care of our trauma team and orthopedic specialists."

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is investigating the crash, which is being treated as an accident.

"This is an accident. An accident is defined as no criminal intent," said Sheriff Alex Villanueva. "We don't contemplate any charges whatsoever in this case. We don't believe that this is a DUI."

Deputy Carlos Gonzalez, who responded to the scene, said Woods was wearing his seatbelt at the time of the crash.

"It's very fortunate that Mr. Woods was wearing a seatbelt," Gonzalez said. "It greatly increased his chances of surviving this traumatic crash."

The crash occurred on Hawthorne Boulevard, a road known for speeding and accidents. According to the Sheriff's Department, there have been 13 accidents on that stretch of road since last January.

Woods was in Los Angeles for his annual Genesis Invitational golf tournament, which was scheduled to begin on Thursday. He had been seen filming with celebrities, including David Spade and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, prior to the crash.

This is Woods' third automobile incident. In 2009, he crashed his SUV into a fire hydrant and a tree outside his Florida home. In 2017, he was arrested for driving under the influence in Florida.

Woods, 45, is one of the most successful golfers in history. He has won 15 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus' 18. He has also won 82 PGA Tour events, tied for the most all-time.

The golf world and beyond is sending well wishes to Woods for a speedy recovery.

"Tiger Woods is a true champion and a role model for millions around the world," said PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan. "We are all praying for him and his family during this difficult time."

"Tiger, you are a fighter. You have overcome so much in your life, and I know you will overcome this too," said former President Barack Obama.

Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, said in a statement that Woods is "awake, responsive, and recovering in his hospital room."

"We thank everyone for the well wishes and privacy respecting the family's request," Steinberg said.
