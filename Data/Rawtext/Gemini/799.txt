Third Stimulus Checks: Over 156 Million Payments Distributed, IRS Offers Guidance for Unpaid Funds

Washington, D.C. - President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act into law in March 2021, authorizing a third round of stimulus payments to provide financial relief to Americans amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has since distributed over 156 million of these payments, totaling billions of dollars.

Eligibility and Payment Status

Individuals who meet the eligibility criteria, including income thresholds and residency requirements, have received or will receive their third stimulus check. The IRS has established a Get My Payment tool on its website where individuals can track the status of their payment and confirm the amount they received.

Claiming Unpaid Stimulus Checks

Individuals who have not yet received their third stimulus check or believe they are entitled to additional funds can claim them by filing their 2020 tax return. Line 30 of the 1040 (or 1040-SR) form is used to request any unpaid stimulus payments.

Calculating Unpaid Stimulus Amount

To accurately claim unpaid stimulus funds, individuals must know how much they have already received and how much they are entitled to. The IRS provides worksheets and tax-filing software to help calculate the amount owed.

IRS Verification and Adjustments

The IRS will review the claimed stimulus payment amounts against its records. If there is a discrepancy, the IRS will send a letter explaining the difference and any necessary adjustments.

Impact on Tax Refunds and IRS Bills

Claiming unpaid stimulus payments could result in a larger tax refund or reduce outstanding IRS bills. The IRS emphasizes that individuals should file their taxes accurately to avoid potential delays or penalties.

Extended Tax Filing Deadline

The deadline to file 2020 taxes and claim unpaid stimulus funds has been extended until May 17, 2021. This extension provides additional time for individuals to gather necessary documents and file their returns.

IRS Assistance

The IRS encourages individuals with questions or concerns about stimulus payments to visit its website or contact the IRS hotline at 1-800-919-9835. Tax professionals can also provide guidance and assistance with filing tax returns and claiming unpaid stimulus funds.
