Rittenhouse's Post-Acquittal Media Blitz Raises Concerns

KENOSHA, Wis. (CBS 58) – Following his acquittal on all charges last week, Kyle Rittenhouse has remained in the public eye, sparking concerns about the potential impact of his actions on future litigation.

After the verdict, Rittenhouse's attorney, Mark Richards, held a news conference but distanced himself from Rittenhouse's media decisions. "I'm not going to be involved in any of those," Richards said.

Despite this, Fox News' Tucker Carlson announced an exclusive interview with Rittenhouse, which was met with controversy. Rittenhouse's legal team objected to the interaction, with Richards expressing disapproval of Rittenhouse allowing Carlson's film crew to follow him before the trial.

"I think it was a mistake," Richards said. "I think he should have listened to us."

In advising Rittenhouse post-verdict, Richards emphasized the importance of taking responsibility and learning to refuse certain requests. "He's got to learn to say no," Richards said.

Rittenhouse has continued to maintain a high public profile, visiting former President Donald Trump in Florida. Legal expert Julius Kim commented that while Rittenhouse is free to do what he wants, his public actions could negatively impact him in potential future litigation.

"Anything he says or does can be used against him in any subsequent legal challenges," Kim said.

Kim highlighted the risks associated with making public statements that could be used against Rittenhouse in any future civil cases. "If he profits from his notoriety, it may increase his chances of being targeted by lawsuits related to the events of August 25, 2020," Kim said.

Concerns are raised about the implications of Rittenhouse's public appearances and statements for any future civil cases. "He needs to be very careful about what he says and does," Kim said. "Every word he utters could be used against him."

Richards echoed these concerns, saying, "He's got to be careful. He's got to be responsible. He's got to be accountable."
