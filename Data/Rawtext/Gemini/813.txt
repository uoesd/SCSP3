Broken Promise: The $2,000 Stimulus Check That Never Was

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the promise of $2,000 stimulus checks became a beacon of hope for struggling Americans. However, the reality fell short of the expectations, leaving many questioning the integrity of the promise.

The Promise

During the Georgia Senate runoff elections, then President-elect Joe Biden, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) all touted $2,000 stimulus payments. Biden declared, "We need $2,000 checks going out the door immediately." Schumer echoed this sentiment, stating, "We need to get $2,000 checks out to the American people." Sanders emphasized, "We need to pass $2,000 survival checks."

The Reality

Despite these promises, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, signed into law by Biden, included $1,400 stimulus checks for individuals and $2,800 for married and joint filers. This fell $600 short of the promised $2,000.

The Discrepancy

Some Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), highlighted the discrepancy between the promised $2,000 and the delivered $1,400 checks. Ocasio-Cortez stated, "We were promised $2,000 stimulus checks. We got $1,400." Bush declared, "The American people were promised $2,000 checks. They deserve $2,000 checks."

Proposals for Monthly Payments

There were also proposals for providing $2,000 stimulus checks on a monthly basis until the end of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, these proposals did not gain traction.

Criticisms of Biden

Biden faced criticism for not delivering on the full $2,000 stimulus check as promised. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) expressed his disappointment, saying, "I think it's a broken promise."

Biden's Defense

The Biden administration argued that the combination of the second stimulus check of $600 and the third of $1,400 equals $2,000 in total stimulus payments. Biden stated, "We're going to get $2,000 in checks out to the American people."

Biden's Pragmatism

Biden has been mentioned as being preferential towards a stimulus package that could realistically be passed, acknowledging the hesitance of moderate Democrats regarding a $2,000 check.

Total Stimulus Payments

Under the conditions laid out in the legislation, a family of four could receive a total of $5,600 in stimulus payments from the third stimulus check.

Conclusion

The promise of $2,000 stimulus checks has been examined against the reality of the $1,400 checks delivered. Whether the "promise" was kept is a matter of perspective. Some argue that the combination of the second and third checks fulfills the promise, while others maintain that the shortfall of $600 constitutes a broken promise. The debate continues, leaving Americans to decide for themselves if the promise was kept.
