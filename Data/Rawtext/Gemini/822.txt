Stimulus Checks for Prisoners: A Partisan Divide

The issue of whether prisoners should receive stimulus checks has sparked a partisan divide, with Democrats and Republicans taking opposing stances. While both parties have supported stimulus bills that included payments to prisoners in the past, recent efforts to exclude them have been met with resistance from Democrats.

Democrats' Opposition to Amendment Barring Stimulus Checks for Prisoners

In the recent COVID-19 relief package, Democrats opposed an amendment proposed by Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) that would have barred prisoners from receiving $1,400 stimulus checks. Democrats argued that the amendment would disproportionately harm prisoners' families, who rely on the checks for financial support.

"This amendment would hurt the families of prisoners, who are already struggling to make ends meet," said Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). "It would also disproportionately harm children and communities of color, who are more likely to have family members in prison."

Cotton's Criticism of Decision

Cotton criticized the decision to allow stimulus checks to go to prisoners, arguing that they have not lost jobs due to the pandemic and thus do not need the financial assistance.

"Prisoners have not lost their jobs because of the pandemic," Cotton said. "They are not eligible for unemployment benefits. They do not need stimulus checks."

Eligibility for Stimulus Payments

Eligibility for stimulus payments is broad, requiring only citizenship or legal residency and either a tax return filing or completion of an IRS form. This means that prisoners who meet these criteria are eligible for the checks, regardless of their incarceration status.

Previous Stimulus Checks for Prisoners

Previous stimulus checks during the Trump administration were also available to prisoners. The CARES Act, passed in March 2020, included payments to prisoners who met the eligibility criteria.

Cotton's Explanation for CARES Act Payments

Cotton's press secretary, James Arnold, claimed that the issue with prisoners receiving checks in the CARES Act was "unanticipated" and could not be amended in December's bill.

"The issue of prisoners receiving stimulus checks in the CARES Act was unanticipated," Arnold said. "We were not able to amend it in the December bill."

Republicans' Past Opportunities to Address Issue

However, Republicans had opportunities to address the issue of stimulus payments to prisoners in past legislation but did not. The CARES Act was passed with bipartisan support, and Republicans could have included an amendment to exclude prisoners at that time.

Fact Check Rating: Mostly True

The claim that Democrats voted to give stimulus checks to prisoners is rated as "Mostly True." While it is true that Democrats supported the recent COVID-19 relief package that included payments to prisoners, it is also true that Republicans have supported similar measures in the past.

Conclusion

The issue of stimulus checks for prisoners has become a partisan divide, with Democrats and Republicans taking opposing stances. Democrats argue that excluding prisoners from stimulus payments would disproportionately harm their families and communities of color, while Republicans argue that prisoners do not need the financial assistance. The eligibility criteria for stimulus payments are broad, and prisoners who meet the criteria are eligible for the checks, regardless of their incarceration status.
