Federal Stimulus Checks Unlikely, States Step Up with Own Payments

The prospect of a fourth round of federal stimulus checks for the general American public appears increasingly unlikely, as lawmakers prioritize other forms of financial support and states take the initiative to provide their own payments.

No Federal Anticipation

Despite ongoing economic challenges and rising inflation, there has been no meaningful discussion at the federal level about issuing another round of stimulus checks. The Biden administration has focused on other measures, such as the American Rescue Plan Act, which provided direct payments to many Americans in 2021.

State Stimulus Initiatives

In the absence of federal action, several states have launched their own stimulus programs. California, New York, New Mexico, Maryland, and Colorado are among those that have initiated payments to residents. These payments typically range from $250 to $1,000 per individual, with eligibility criteria varying by state.

Targeted Support

State-issued stimulus payments often target specific groups, such as undocumented immigrants, low-income households, and frontline workers. For example, California's Golden State Stimulus II program provides payments to undocumented immigrants who meet certain income requirements.

Funding Sources

States are funding their stimulus programs through various means, including surplus state income tax revenue and federal pandemic aid. New York, for instance, is using $2.1 billion in federal funds to provide payments to low-income New Yorkers.

Congressional Advocacy

Despite the lack of federal action, some lawmakers continue to advocate for additional aid. More than 20 Democratic senators and over 60 Democratic members of the House have signed letters urging the Biden administration to consider recurring direct payments.

Child Tax Credits

The rollout of the expanded child tax credit has provided a form of financial support similar to what was suggested for recurring payments. The credit, which began rolling out in July 2021, provides monthly payments of up to $300 per child to eligible families.

Legislative Challenges

Legislative progress on additional spending or direct payments has been hampered by intense fighting in Congress and a closely divided legislative body. Republicans have largely opposed further stimulus measures, arguing that they would contribute to inflation.

Housing and Food Security

Direct payments and pandemic relief programs have played a crucial role in mitigating housing and food insecurity during the pandemic. According to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, stimulus checks helped reduce food insecurity by 40% among households with children.

Conclusion

While the prospect of a fourth round of federal stimulus checks remains uncertain, states are stepping up to provide their own payments to residents in need. Lawmakers continue to advocate for additional aid, but legislative challenges make it unlikely that further federal stimulus will be approved in the near future.
