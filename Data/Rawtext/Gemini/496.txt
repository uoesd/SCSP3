Biden Visits Hurricane Ida-Ravaged New Jersey, Calls for Climate Action

New Brunswick, New Jersey - President Joe Biden toured flood-stricken areas of New Jersey on Tuesday, September 7, 2021, and pledged federal support for recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Ida's destructive path through the region.

Biden's visit to New Jersey followed his earlier trip to Louisiana, where Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 storm, unleashing devastating floods that claimed the lives of at least 13 people in the state.

Climate Change Impact

During his tour of New Jersey, Biden emphasized the urgent need to address climate change, which he said was intensifying the frequency and severity of extreme weather events like Hurricane Ida.

"We're seeing more and more of these extreme weather events. And it's not just here in New Jersey. It's all across the country," Biden said. "We have to act now to address the climate crisis."

Federal Aid Approved

Biden announced that he had approved major disaster declarations for affected counties in New Jersey and New York, unlocking federal aid to support recovery efforts. The declarations will provide funding for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and repairs to public infrastructure.

Infrastructure Spending

The president also called for increased federal spending on infrastructure to better protect communities from future storms. He highlighted the need for investments in flood control systems, resilient energy grids, and improved transportation networks.

"We need to build back better, and we need to build back more resilient," Biden said. "We can't keep rebuilding the same way we have in the past."

Devastating Floods

Hurricane Ida's remnants brought record-breaking rainfall to the Northeast, causing widespread flooding and power outages. Over 50 people have been killed in six eastern states due to the storm.

In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy said the clean-up and rebuilding process would take months. He estimated that the state had sustained billions of dollars in damage.

"This is a major disaster for our state," Murphy said. "We're going to need all the help we can get from the federal government."

Widespread Impact

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the Biden administration was closely monitoring the aftermath of Hurricane Ida and coordinating with state and local officials to provide assistance.

"This storm has had a devastating impact on communities across the country," Psaki said. "The president is committed to ensuring that those affected receive the support they need to recover and rebuild."

Previous Visit to Louisiana

Biden's visit to New Jersey came just days after he toured hurricane-ravaged areas of Louisiana. The president met with local officials and residents to assess the damage and offer federal support.

Call for Unity

In both New Jersey and Louisiana, Biden emphasized the importance of unity and resilience in the face of adversity. He called on Americans to come together to support those affected by the storm and to work towards a more sustainable and resilient future.

"We're all in this together," Biden said. "We're going to get through this together."
