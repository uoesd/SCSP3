Facebook Bans 'Stop the Steal' Content Amid Crackdown on Misinformation

In the wake of the January 6 storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters, Facebook is removing content containing the phrase 'stop the steal', a rallying cry of those alleging voter fraud in the 2020 elections.

"We've been allowing posts that use 'stop the steal' to condemn the movement or discuss it neutrally," said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's COO. "However, we're now removing content that uses 'stop the steal' to incite violence or spread misinformation about the election."

The move is part of a broader crackdown on misinformation by social media platforms. Twitter permanently banned President Trump and continues to ban political advertising in the US, including ads paid for by Trump or his allies.

Other platforms such as Reddit, YouTube, Pinterest, and TikTok have also taken actions against Trump. Peloton announced a ban on the hashtag #stopthesteal.

Parler, a platform sympathetic to Trump, was suspended by Amazon from its hosting service and removed from Apple and Google app stores.

Twitter removed 70,000 QAnon-related accounts and increased enforcement of policies against incitement of violence and spreading of misleading information.

"No one is above our policies," Sandberg said. "We're committed to keeping people safe on our platform and preventing the spread of misinformation."

The crackdown on misinformation has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised the platforms for taking action, while others have criticized them for censorship.

"It's a necessary step to protect our democracy," said Senator Mark Warner (D-VA). "These platforms have allowed misinformation to spread unchecked for too long."

"This is a dangerous precedent," said Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH). "The government should not be able to dictate what we can and cannot say on social media."

The crackdown on misinformation is likely to continue in the coming weeks and months. As the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden approaches, social media platforms are under pressure to prevent the spread of misinformation that could lead to further violence.
