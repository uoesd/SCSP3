Rittenhouse Proclaims Innocence, Supports BLM After Not-Guilty Verdict

New York – Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager acquitted of all charges stemming from the fatal shootings during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has asserted his innocence and expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Rittenhouse maintained that the case was not about race but rather about his right to self-defense. "I'm not a racist," he declared. "I support the BLM movement."

Rittenhouse, who is white, as were the men he shot, emphasized his belief in peaceful demonstrations. "I went to Kenosha to help people," he said. "I was there to protect businesses and property."

David Hancock, a spokesman for the Rittenhouse family, described Kyle as "a caring, empathetic, and civic-minded young man." He added, "He has always been a strong supporter of the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense."

Rittenhouse was 17 when he traveled to Kenosha in August 2020, where protests had erupted following the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer. During the unrest, Rittenhouse shot and killed two men and injured a third.

At his trial, Rittenhouse testified that he fired in self-defense after being attacked by the victims. The jury ultimately found him not guilty on all charges, including first-degree intentional homicide.

Rittenhouse's case has sparked intense debates about Second Amendment rights and protests against police brutality. Some have hailed him as a hero who defended himself against violent rioters, while others have condemned him as a vigilante who provoked the shootings.

Despite being photographed with members of the Proud Boys, a far-right group, Rittenhouse's attorneys have denied that he is a white supremacist.

The NAACP, the nation's oldest civil rights organization, has expressed concern about the trial's outcome. "This verdict is a warning shot for Black communities across the country," said Derrick Johnson, the NAACP's president and CEO. "It sends a message that vigilantes can take the law into their own hands and kill Black people with impunity."

Rittenhouse's acquittal has reignited discussions about racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Some have argued that the verdict would have been different if Rittenhouse had been Black.

"The fact that Kyle Rittenhouse was found not guilty while Black people are routinely criminalized and killed for far less is a testament to the systemic racism that permeates our society," said Johnson.

Rittenhouse's future remains uncertain. He has expressed interest in pursuing a career in law enforcement, but it is unclear whether he will be able to obtain the necessary training and certification.

The shootings in Kenosha have left a lasting impact on the community. The families of the victims have filed lawsuits against Rittenhouse and the city of Kenosha. The city has also been criticized for its handling of the protests and the shooting.

As the nation grapples with the aftermath of the Rittenhouse trial, it is clear that the issues of race, self-defense, and the right to protest will continue to be debated for years to come.
