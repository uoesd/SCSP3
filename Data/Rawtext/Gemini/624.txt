Harris to Lead National Space Council, Focusing on STEM, Cybersecurity, and Diversity

CNN – Vice President Kamala Harris will chair the National Space Council, continuing its operation under the Biden administration.

Harris announced her new role in a tweet on Thursday, expressing her honor in leading the Council and emphasizing America's achievements in space.

"I am honored to chair the National Space Council and continue America's leadership in space exploration and innovation," Harris tweeted. "Our nation has a proud history of space exploration, and I look forward to working with the Council to build on that legacy."

The Vice President aims to focus the Council on STEM education, cybersecurity, commercial space activity, diversity, and peaceful space norms.

"The Vice President is very focused on making sure that we are doing the work and not just talking about the work," a senior administration official said. "She's very focused on substance over optics."

The National Space Council was previously led by Vice President Mike Pence during the Trump administration, which had revived the council in 2017. The council's operation will continue under the executive order from 2017, with an ongoing review for potential changes.

The council assists the President in forming national space policies and strategies, balancing civil, commercial, and national security space activities.

Harris' approach to the Council is expected to differ from Pence's tenure, which was marked by big displays and ambitious goals.

"The Vice President is very focused on substance over optics," the official said. "She's not going to be doing a lot of big events or speeches. She's going to be focused on getting the work done."

Harris has other significant responsibilities, including diplomatic efforts in the Northern Triangle and expanding broadband access.

"The Vice President has a lot on her plate," the official said. "But she's very committed to the National Space Council and she's going to make sure that it's a success."

Harris will swear in the newly confirmed NASA administrator Bill Nelson.

There's no set date for the National Space Council's first meeting under Harris, but she will begin her duties soon.

Harris' Focus on STEM, Cybersecurity, and Diversity

Harris' focus on STEM education, cybersecurity, and diversity in space aligns with her broader policy agenda.

"The Vice President is very committed to STEM education," the official said. "She believes that we need to invest in our children and give them the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century economy."

Harris is also focused on cybersecurity, an increasingly important issue in the space domain.

"The Vice President is very concerned about cybersecurity," the official said. "She believes that we need to take steps to protect our space assets from cyber threats."

Harris is also committed to promoting diversity in the space sector.

"The Vice President believes that we need to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to participate in the space program," the official said. "She's going to work to make sure that the National Space Council is inclusive and that everyone has a voice."
