Baldwin's Phone Seized in 'Rust' Shooting Probe, Emails Reveal Gun Choice Discussions

Santa Fe, New Mexico - A search warrant has been issued to acquire Alec Baldwin's cell phone for a forensic download, as part of the ongoing investigation into the fatal shooting on the set of the Western film "Rust."

According to an affidavit from Detective Alexandria Hancock, Baldwin discussed his choice of weapon with Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed via email before the incident. The affidavit states that Baldwin requested a larger gun for the rehearsal, specifically a Colt .45.

"Mr. Baldwin requested a larger gun for the rehearsal," Hancock wrote in the affidavit. "He specifically requested a Colt .45."

The search warrant was issued after Baldwin's cooperation in providing the phone was contingent on a warrant being issued. His civil attorney, Aaron Dyer, stated that Baldwin is cooperating with authorities and emphasized the need to protect personal information on Baldwin's phone.

"Mr. Baldwin is cooperating with authorities and has provided his phone to the authorities," Dyer said. "We are confident that the evidence will show that Mr. Baldwin is not responsible for this tragic accident."

Baldwin has insisted in an ABC News interview that he did not pull the trigger. He claimed the gun fired when he released the hammer. Lisa Torraco, attorney for Rust assistant director Dave Halls, supported Baldwin's claim that he did not pull the trigger.

"Mr. Baldwin did not pull the trigger," Torraco said. "The gun fired when Mr. Baldwin released the hammer."

The incident resulted in the death of 42-year-old cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuries to director Joel Souza. The detective believes Baldwin's phone may contain evidence of the commission of a crime.

"The phone may contain evidence of the commission of a crime, including text messages, emails, and other communications between Mr. Baldwin and other individuals involved in the production of 'Rust,'" Hancock wrote in the affidavit.

Discussions about the choice of gun and accessories for the production were conducted through email between Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed. The emails show that Baldwin was actively involved in the decision-making process regarding the weapons used on set.

"The emails show that Mr. Baldwin was very specific about the type of gun he wanted to use for the rehearsal," Hancock said. "He also requested specific accessories for the gun, including a larger magazine."

The investigation into the shooting is ongoing. No charges have been filed at this time.
