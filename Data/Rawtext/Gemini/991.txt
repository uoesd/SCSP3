YouTube Suspends Trump's Channel, Disables Comments Indefinitely

In the wake of the violent insurrection at the US Capitol, YouTube has taken decisive action against President Donald Trump's channel, suspending it for at least a week due to concerns over "ongoing potential for violence." The platform has also disabled all comments on Trump's channel indefinitely.

This move comes after Twitter permanently banned Trump and Facebook suspended him at least until President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.

"This is an important and necessary first step," said Jim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media. "But it should not be the last. YouTube should make this suspension permanent."

Steyer argued that Trump's channel has been a "breeding ground for misinformation and incitement of violence," and that its continued presence on the platform poses a threat to public safety.

Google Pauses Political Ads

In a related move, Google has announced a pause on political ads on its platforms until after Inauguration Day. The company said this measure is intended to prevent the spread of misinformation and exploitation of the Capitol siege.

Parler Finds New Home, Sues Amazon

Parler, the social media platform popular among Trump supporters, has registered its domain with Epik, a company known for hosting far-right services. This move comes after Parler was removed by Amazon Web Services and app stores for its failure to moderate violent content.

Parler has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, alleging antitrust violations over its expulsion. The lawsuit claims that Amazon's actions were motivated by political bias and aimed at silencing conservative voices.
