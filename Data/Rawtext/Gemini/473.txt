Lilibet's Name: A Contradiction in Harry and Meghan's Anti-Racism Stance

On June 4, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry welcomed their second child, a daughter named Lilibet 'Lili' Diana Mountbatten-Windsor. The name 'Lilibet' is a nod to Queen Elizabeth II, whose family nickname is Lilibet, while 'Diana' honors Harry's late mother, Princess Diana.

The choice of name has raised eyebrows, given Harry and Meghan's previous allegations of racism within the Royal Family. In a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, the couple detailed their struggles with racism, lack of support, and concerns over mental health, which ultimately led them to leave the Royal Family.

The decision to name their daughter after members of the institution they have accused of racial abuse has sparked a debate about their stance against the monarchy and its traditions. Some argue that naming their child after the Queen sends a message of support to the royal family, despite their previous criticisms.

It is important to note that Harry and Meghan have not explicitly stated that they are naming their daughter after the Queen as a gesture of reconciliation. However, the choice of name does raise questions about their commitment to challenging the monarchy's history of racism.

Real change against racism and the monarchy requires more than just personal reconciliation with the family. It necessitates a fundamental shift in the institution's power structures, policies, and attitudes. Naming their daughter after the Queen may be seen as a symbolic gesture, but it does little to address the systemic issues that Harry and Meghan have highlighted.

Furthermore, the choice of name could be interpreted as a way for Harry and Meghan to maintain a connection to the royal family while distancing themselves from its negative aspects. This could be seen as a compromise, but it also undermines their previous criticisms of the institution.

It is important to remember that Harry and Meghan are not heroes in the anti-racism movement. They are family members seeking reconciliation, and their actions should be evaluated accordingly. While their personal experiences with racism are valid, their decision to name their daughter after the Queen should not be seen as a victory for anti-racism.

The fight against racism and the monarchy's problematic history requires more than just symbolic gestures. It requires sustained activism, policy changes, and a willingness to challenge the status quo. Harry and Meghan's decision to name their daughter after the Queen may be a personal choice, but it does not absolve them from their responsibility to continue speaking out against racism within the institution.

In conclusion, the choice of name for Harry and Meghan's daughter raises questions about their stance against the royal institution and traditions. While their personal experiences with racism are valid, naming their daughter after the Queen sends a mixed message and undermines their previous criticisms of the monarchy. Real change against racism and the monarchy requires more than just personal reconciliation; it necessitates a fundamental shift in the institution's power structures, policies, and attitudes.
