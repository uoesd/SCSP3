Ziminski Faces Arson Charge in Kenosha Protest Case

Kenosha, Wis. – Joshua Ziminski, a key figure in the Kenosha protests that led to the fatal shooting of Joseph Rosenbaum by Kyle Rittenhouse, has been charged with felony arson and other misdemeanors.

Ziminski, 36, was arrested on Aug. 25 after allegedly attempting to block police and starting a large trash bin fire at a gas station. He was also seen manipulating the fire of an overturned, burning trailer blocking police.

The new charges come after Ziminski was previously accused of firing a shot in the air before Rittenhouse fatally shot Rosenbaum. That case was dismissed in December due to insufficient evidence.

Ziminski's wife, Kelly Ziminski, was also charged with disorderly conduct, resisting an officer, and curfew violation. She has a pretrial conference scheduled for March 17.

According to prosecutors, Ziminski's shot fired was the "first shot" that night, potentially leading Rittenhouse to believe he was being attacked. Ziminski's supporters have claimed that his shot was fired in self-defense.

Both Joshua and Kelly Ziminski were involved in a confrontation with police during the protests. Video footage shows Joshua Ziminski arguing with officers and Kelly Ziminski being arrested.

Kyle Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shootings, pleaded not guilty to homicide among other counts. He claims he acted in self-defense when he shot Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber, and Gaige Grosskreutz.

The case has brought renewed attention to the Kenosha protests and the incidents of violence that occurred. The protests erupted in August 2020 following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man.

The charges against Ziminski are the latest in a series of legal proceedings stemming from the Kenosha protests. Several other individuals have been charged with crimes related to the unrest, including arson, looting, and rioting.

The case is expected to go to trial later this year.
