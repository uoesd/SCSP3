FDA Statement on COVID-19 Vaccine Dosing Schedules

Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today emphasized the importance of adhering to the authorized dosing schedules for COVID-19 vaccines, following the release of data suggesting high effectiveness after a single dose.

Two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, have demonstrated approximately 95% effectiveness in preventing the disease in adults after a two-dose regimen. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires a 21-day interval between doses, while the Moderna vaccine requires 28 days.

The FDA cautions against altering these authorized dosing schedules or mixing vaccines without solid evidence to support such changes. Changing the dosing schedule without adequate data may pose a significant risk to public health.

"Misinterpretation of data regarding a single dose's effectiveness can lead to unwarranted assumptions about protection," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. "There is concern that altering dose regimens without understanding protection depth and duration could be harmful."

The FDA's decision to authorize the COVID-19 vaccines was based on rigorous scientific evaluation of clinical trial data. The trials demonstrated that the vaccines are safe and effective when administered according to the authorized dosing schedules.

"The FDA's role includes assuring the safety and effectiveness of drugs, vaccines, and other biological products," said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "We will continue to make decisions based on data and science."

Healthcare providers are strongly recommended to follow the FDA-authorized dosing schedule for COVID-19 vaccines. Any changes to the dosing schedule should be based on sound scientific evidence and should be made in consultation with public health officials.

The FDA will continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and will provide updates as new information becomes available.
