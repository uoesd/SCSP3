Ever Given Frees Suez Canal After 106-Day Blockage

ISMAILIA, Egypt, July 7 (Reuters) – The Ever Given container ship, which blocked the Suez Canal for 106 days, has finally left the waterway, allowing global trade to resume its normal course.

The ship resumed its journey heading north across the Great Bitter Lake, where it had been moored since being refloated on March 29. The departure followed the signing of a compensation settlement between the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) and the ship's representatives.

"The ship is free to go," said Tarek Alzeki, captain of a tug boat that helped guide the Ever Given out of the canal. "It's a great relief for everyone."

The Ever Given, loaded with about 18,300 containers, was due for a hull inspection before sailing to its next port. The ship had been held under court order while the SCA sought compensation from its owner and insurers.

"We are pleased that the Ever Given has finally been released," said R P Veetil, General Secretary of the Sailors Union of India. "This has been a long and difficult ordeal for the crew."

An undisclosed settlement was reached between the parties, with some compensation to be paid this month. The SCA aims to keep the terms of the agreement confidential.

"We are not at liberty to discuss the details of the settlement," said Khalid Abubakr, a lawyer for the SCA. "However, we can confirm that an agreement has been reached."

The Ever Given's blockage of the Suez Canal caused a major disruption to global trade, with hundreds of ships forced to wait to transit the waterway. The incident has led to a push to widen and deepen the southernmost section of the canal and extend a second lane.

"The Suez Canal is a vital artery for global trade," said Yukito Higaki, a spokesman for Imabari shipbuilding, a subsidiary of Shoei Kisen, the owner of the Ever Given. "We are committed to working with the SCA to ensure that such an incident does not happen again."

The SCA has said that it will not change the rules for ships transiting the canal in difficult weather conditions.

"The current rules are adequate," said Osama Rabie, SCA Chairman. "We will continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary."

The International Chamber of Shipping has welcomed the release of the Ever Given.

"This is a positive step forward," said Guy Platten, Secretary General of the International Chamber of Shipping. "We urge all parties to work together to prevent such incidents from happening in the future."
