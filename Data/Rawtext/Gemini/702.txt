Crumbleys Plead Not Guilty in Michigan School Shooting

OXFORD TOWNSHIP, Mich. – James and Jennifer Crumbley, the parents of Ethan Crumbley, the 15-year-old charged with murder and other crimes in the Michigan high school shooting, pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges on Friday.

The charges stem from the November 30 shooting at Oxford High School that killed four students and injured seven others. Ethan Crumbley is accused of carrying out the attack with a gun his father had purchased just days before.

A timeline of events leading up to the shooting reveals a series of concerning behaviors and missed warnings.

Disturbing Social Media Posts and Note

In the days leading up to the shooting, Ethan Crumbley posted disturbing messages on social media, including a photo of a gun with the caption "Just got my new beauty today." He also posted a video of himself shooting at a target.

On the morning of the shooting, a teacher found Ethan searching for ammunition online at school. The teacher reported the incident to school officials, but no action was taken.

Later that morning, another teacher discovered a note Ethan had drawn on his math homework. The note contained drawings of a handgun and phrases indicating distress and violence.

Parents Refuse to Take Son Home

School counselors evaluated Ethan's behavior and responses and did not believe he posed a threat. However, they called his parents and asked them to take him home.

James and Jennifer Crumbley refused, saying they would take him to a doctor after school. They left the school without Ethan, who went on to shoot and wound students and a teacher shortly after.

Manhunt and Arrests

Following a manhunt, the Crumbleys were arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter. A third-party review of the events leading up to the shooting has been announced.

Prosecutor: Parents 'Had a Duty to Intervene'

Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said the Crumbleys "had a duty to intervene" when they saw their son's disturbing behavior.

"They failed to do so, and as a result, four students are dead and seven others are injured," McDonald said.

Superintendent: 'We Failed Our Students'

Oxford Community Schools Superintendent Tim Throne said the district "failed our students" by not taking appropriate action after Ethan Crumbley's note was discovered.

"We should have done more to protect our students," Throne said.

Sheriff: 'Missed Opportunities'

Sheriff's Lieutenant Tim Willis said there were "missed opportunities" to prevent the shooting.

"We could have done more to connect the dots and prevent this tragedy," Willis said.

Parents' Attorney: 'They're Not Guilty'

The Crumbleys' attorney, Shannon Smith, said his clients are "not guilty" of involuntary manslaughter.

"They did not know their son was going to commit this terrible crime," Smith said.

The trial for the Crumbleys is scheduled to begin on January 17, 2023.
