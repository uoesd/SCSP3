False Claim: Bill Clinton Poisoned at Guantanamo Bay Debunked

A fabricated story claiming former President Bill Clinton was poisoned to death at Guantanamo Bay has been circulating on social media, prompting a fact-checking investigation that has debunked the false claim.

The baseless rumor, which originated from the website Real Raw News, alleged that Clinton had been hospitalized at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Guantanamo Bay and later died from poisoning. However, Clinton was actually hospitalized in California for a non-COVID-related infection, specifically sepsis.

"President Clinton was admitted to UCI Medical Center on Tuesday evening with an infection," said Angel Ureña, Clinton's spokesperson. "He is on the mend, and we appreciate the well wishes he has received."

The false claim about Clinton's death is part of a broader pattern of fabricated stories about high-profile figures, often linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. Real Raw News, the source of the Clinton poisoning claim, is known for publishing fake stories and conspiracy theories.

"The story about President Clinton's death is completely false," said Dawn Grimes, a spokesperson for the U.S. Naval Hospital in Guantanamo Bay. "There was no autopsy performed or overseen by Capt. Dale Ramirez, as the story claims."

Real Raw News has a disclaimer stating that its content contains humor, parody, and satire. However, this disclaimer is hidden on the website's about page, making it easy for readers to miss.

A fact-checking investigation by PolitiFact attributes these fabricated stories to Michael Ruffin, who uses the pseudonym Michael Baxter. Ruffin defends the accuracy of his stories despite the satire disclaimer.

"I stand by my reporting," Ruffin told PolitiFact. "I have sources that I trust, and I believe the stories I write are true."

However, PolitiFact found that Ruffin's stories often contain factual errors and rely on anonymous sources. In the case of the Clinton poisoning claim, Ruffin cited an unnamed source at Guantanamo Bay and a fictitious U.S. Naval Hospital officer named Capt. Dale Ramirez.

The false claim about Clinton's death has been widely shared on social media, prompting concern and confusion among his supporters. However, the fact-checking investigation has confirmed that the claim is baseless and that Clinton is alive and recovering from an infection.

"President Clinton is in excellent spirits and is looking forward to getting back to work," said Ureña. "We appreciate the support and well wishes he has received."

It is important to be aware of the spread of false information and to rely on credible sources for news and information. Fact-checking organizations like PolitiFact play a crucial role in debunking fabricated stories and ensuring that the public has access to accurate information.
