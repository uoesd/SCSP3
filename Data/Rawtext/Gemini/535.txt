Biden Vows to 'Hunt Down' Kabul Attackers, Declares 'We Will Not Forgive or Forget'

In the wake of the deadly attack outside Kabul's airport, President Joe Biden has vowed to "hunt down" those responsible, declaring that the United States "will not forgive or forget." The attack, claimed by the Islamic State group, resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and dozens of Afghans.

"We will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation," Biden said in a televised address to the nation. "We will hunt down the terrorists who carried out this attack and make them pay."

The president praised the service members killed in the attack as "heroes" and the "backbone of America." He offered his condolences to their families and led a moment of silence in their honor.

"These American heroes who gave their lives, serving others, serving our nation, they were part of an extraordinary mission," Biden said. "They represented the very best of our country."

The attack occurred as large crowds have been gathering around the Kabul airport for weeks, seeking evacuation amid the U.S. military withdrawal and Taliban takeover. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., head of U.S. Central Command, confirmed that the attack involved a suicide bombing followed by Islamist State gunmen opening fire.

"We do not know the exact number of casualties, but it is believed to be in the dozens," McKenzie said. "We are still assessing the situation."

McKenzie acknowledged a "failure somewhere" in security, as the bomber was being screened by American forces at a gate.

"We are looking into how this happened," McKenzie said. "We will find out what went wrong and we will fix it."

The Pentagon later corrected initial reports, clarifying that there was only one bombing, not two.

Despite the attack, ongoing evacuations have moved more than 104,000 civilians since August 14, including about 5,000 Americans.

"We have evacuated more people in the last 10 days than we did in the entire month of July," McKenzie said. "We are working around the clock to get as many people out as possible."

Biden emphasized that terrorism would not deter the U.S. from continuing its evacuation mission or intimidate the nation.

"We will not be intimidated. We will not be deterred. We will not let the terrorists win," Biden said. "We will continue our mission to evacuate American citizens, our Afghan allies, and other vulnerable Afghans."

The president also called on the Taliban to cooperate with the U.S. in securing the airport and allowing safe passage for those seeking to evacuate.

"We have made it clear to the Taliban that any attack on our forces or disruption of our operations at the airport will be met with a swift and forceful response," Biden said.

The attack on the Kabul airport has been widely condemned by world leaders and international organizations. The United Nations Security Council issued a statement condemning the attack and calling for those responsible to be held accountable.

"The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the deplorable terrorist attack that took place on 26 August 2021 outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, which resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians and members of the United States armed forces," the statement said.

The attack has also raised concerns about the security of the evacuation mission and the safety of those still seeking to leave Afghanistan.

"We are deeply concerned about the safety of our staff and the people we are trying to help," said a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. "We are working with our partners to ensure that those in need of protection are able to reach safety."

The U.S. military has increased security measures at the Kabul airport in response to the attack. Additional troops have been deployed and checkpoints have been strengthened.

"We are doing everything we can to secure the airport and ensure the safe evacuation of our citizens and Afghan allies," McKenzie said. "We will not be deterred by this attack."
