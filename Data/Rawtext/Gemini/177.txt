The Bell and Ladder of Wealth Preservation

In 1868, Franz Vester patented a coffin equipped with a bell and ladder, offering a lifeline to those prematurely buried. Today, we face a similar predicament, not of physical entombment, but of the premature burial of wealth. Modern government policies, like Vester's invention, are designed to preserve wealth after death, creating a parallel between the past and present.

In recent years, the United States has witnessed a significant shift in wealth redistribution, with a focus on inheritance rather than income. President Joe Biden's recent attempt to reform policies affecting inheritance was met with resistance from fellow Democrats, highlighting the entrenched nature of these practices. Since 1989, the wealthiest one percent of Americans have seen their share of the nation's wealth grow from 30% to 39%, a trend attributed to rising income inequality. However, future wealth inequality may be driven more by unequal inheritance than by unequal income.

As millennials and younger generations age, we anticipate the largest transfer of wealth in U.S. history. Current and future government policies may allow for the 'resurrection' of the deceased's wealth, preserving it for generations to come. This raises concerns about the societal and economic implications of such wealth preservation and redistribution practices.

The bell and ladder of wealth preservation may provide a temporary lifeline for the wealthy, but it will ultimately lead to a society where the gap between the haves and have-nots widens. It is imperative that we re-examine our policies and prioritize policies that promote equitable wealth distribution, ensuring that the fruits of our labor are shared more fairly across generations.
