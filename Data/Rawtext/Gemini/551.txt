ISIS-K Emerges as Threat to Taliban Rule in Afghanistan

Sept 23 (Reuters) – The Islamic State in Khorasan (ISIS-K) has emerged as a significant threat to the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan, employing guerrilla tactics similar to those used by the Taliban against U.S. forces.

Despite Taliban control, ISIS-K has launched deadly attacks, including the suicide bombing at Kabul airport and a series of bomb blasts in Jalalabad.

"ISIS-K is a serious threat to the stability of Afghanistan," said Rohan Gunaratna, a professor of security studies at Nanyang Technological University. "They have shown their ability to carry out complex and deadly attacks."

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has downplayed the threat, saying ISIS-K is "a small group that has no popular support." However, Taliban commanders have expressed concern over ISIS-K's tactics, particularly the use of sticky bombs.

"They are using the same tactics that we used against the Americans," said a Taliban commander in Nangarhar province. "They are very difficult to detect and can cause significant casualties."

ISIS-K has suffered losses from both Taliban and U.S. forces since its peak around 2018, leading to a decline in its activities. However, recent attacks suggest that the group is regaining strength.

Taliban security forces reported killing three ISIS-K members in a raid in Kabul, indicating ongoing conflict between the two groups.

Some analysts and the UN believe the return of the Taliban to power may invigorate extremist groups like ISIS-K and al Qaeda.

"The Taliban's victory has created a vacuum that could be exploited by these groups," said a UN report. "The Taliban's inability to provide security and governance could lead to defections to ISIS-K."

ISIS-K's strength is estimated to be under 2,000 fighters, considerably fewer than the Taliban's forces. However, the group's use of guerrilla tactics and its ability to recruit new members make it a formidable opponent.

ISIS-K recruits include former Taliban members and fighters from the Pakistani Taliban (TTP). The group is also believed to receive financial and logistical support from its parent organization in Syria, although this support has reportedly diminished.

"ISIS-K is a resilient group that has adapted to the changing environment in Afghanistan," said Gunaratna. "They will continue to pose a threat to the Taliban and the stability of the country."
