WHO Approves Two AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 Vaccines for Emergency Use

Geneva, Switzerland - The World Health Organization (WHO) has granted Emergency Use Listing (EUL) to two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine, paving the way for their wider distribution through the COVAX Facility and accelerating regulatory approvals in countries around the world.

"This is a critical step towards ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines," said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. "These vaccines are safe, effective, and affordable, and they will play a vital role in protecting people and saving lives."

The EUL process is a rigorous assessment of a vaccine's safety, efficacy, and quality. Vaccine developers must submit full data for a rapid assessment by WHO, which includes inspections of manufacturing sites. The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines' EUL process took under four weeks.

The two vaccines that have received EUL are produced by AstraZeneca-SKBio (Republic of Korea) and the Serum Institute of India. Both vaccines are based on the ChAdOx1-S technology, which uses a modified chimpanzee adenovirus to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization has recommended the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine for use in all adults aged 18 and above. The vaccine has been found to have a 63.09% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 and is suitable for use in low- and middle-income countries.

"The EUL procedure is a critical tool for making health products available rapidly during emergencies, while ensuring that they meet the necessary standards of safety, efficacy, and quality," said Dr Simão. "We are committed to working with all partners to ensure that everyone, everywhere has access to these life-saving vaccines."

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was also listed by WHO for emergency use on 31 December 2020.
