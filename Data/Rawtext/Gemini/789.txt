Biden Unveils $1.9 Trillion 'Rescue Plan' with $1,400 Stimulus Payments

President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled a sweeping $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package that includes an additional $1,400 in direct payments to Americans. This brings the total cash relief to $2,000, combined with the previously distributed $600.

"We need to act now," Biden said in a speech outlining the plan. "We need to deliver immediate relief to the American people."

Direct Payments

The $465 billion allocated for direct payments would provide $1,400 to each eligible individual, including dependents. This expands eligibility beyond those under 17 to include college students and disabled adults.

Income eligibility for the new payment would likely follow the same criteria as the current $600 stimulus payments. Payments would gradually reduce for individuals with an adjusted gross income (AGI) over $75,000 and married couples with an AGI over $150,000, adjusting with the number of dependents.

Eligibility would be determined based on the most recent tax return and AGI. The IRS used 2019 tax returns to determine eligibility for the second round of checks.

Impact on Income

The additional $1,400 payment would significantly boost income for America's poorest families. The lowest 20% of households would experience a 29% income increase with the $2,000 checks. For comparison, the current $600 payment raises income for the same group by 8%, and the $1,200 CARES Act payments increased it by 11%.

Other Provisions

In addition to direct payments, Biden's plan includes funding for vaccine distribution, unemployment benefits, small business support, and aid to state and local governments.

"This is a bold plan, but it is a plan that is necessary," Biden said. "It is a plan that will help us build back better."

Congressional Approval

The plan is expected to face resistance from Republicans in Congress, who have expressed concerns about the cost and scope of the package. However, Biden has urged lawmakers to work together to pass the legislation.

"We have to act now," Biden said. "We cannot afford to wait."
