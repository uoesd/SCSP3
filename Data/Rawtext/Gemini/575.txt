As Biden departed Dover Air Force Base after meeting with the families, a woman shouted at him, "Burn in hell!" expressing her anger over his handling of the meeting.

Father's Frustration

Mark Schmitz, father of deceased Marine Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz, expressed frustration over Biden mentioning his own son, Beau, and allegedly checking his watch during the meeting.

"He started talking about his son, Beau. I was just thinking, 'You know what? I don't want to hear about your son. I want to hear about my son,'" Schmitz said.

Debated Watch Check

The veracity of Biden checking his watch during the dignified transfer of the coffins is debated. Some witnesses claimed he did, while others disputed the allegation.

Families' Disappointment

Jiennah McCollum, widow of Marine Lance Corporal Rylee McCollum, and her sister described their disappointment with Biden's conversation as "scripted and shallow."

"It was like he was reading off a teleprompter. It wasn't genuine," McCollum said.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended Biden, emphasizing his empathetic intent despite the criticisms.

"The President's intention was to convey his heartfelt condolences and support to the families," Psaki said.

"I'm not going to talk to the man who disrespected my son," Hoover said.
