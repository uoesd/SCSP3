Biden's Inauguration to Unfold Amidst Unprecedented Security, Virtual Festivities

Washington, D.C. - President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20th will be a historic event marked by unprecedented security measures and a scaled-back, heavily virtual format due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and heightened security concerns following the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

Heightened Security in the Nation's Capital

In the wake of the Capitol riot, more than 25,000 National Guard soldiers have been deployed to Washington, D.C., to ensure a secure and peaceful inauguration. The National Mall, the traditional gathering place for inauguration crowds, will be closed to the public, and crowd size at the ceremony will be significantly reduced, with about 1,000 guests expected.

Virtual Inaugural Balls and Star-Studded Concert

The traditional black-tie inaugural balls have been replaced by a star-studded virtual concert hosted by Tom Hanks, featuring performances by Justin Timberlake, Demi Lovato, Jon Bon Jovi, and Ant Clemons. The concert will be streamed live on multiple platforms, allowing Americans across the country to participate in the festivities from the safety of their homes.

Memorial for COVID-19 Victims and Virtual Programming

The inauguration will be preceded by a memorial for coronavirus victims on January 19th, honoring the lives lost during the pandemic. Several days of virtual programming, including a youth inaugural concert and a poetry reading, will also take place leading up to the ceremony.

Changes to Biden's Travel Plans and Inauguration Rehearsal

Security concerns have prompted changes to Biden's travel plans and the postponement of the inauguration rehearsal. Biden, who typically travels by train to Washington, D.C., for the inauguration, will instead fly to the city on January 19th. The inauguration rehearsal, which was scheduled for January 18th, has been postponed due to security concerns.

Former Presidents and First Ladies to Attend

Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, along with former First Ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, and Hillary Clinton, will attend the inauguration. Notably absent will be former President Donald Trump, who has declined to attend.

Post-Inauguration Events

Following the inauguration ceremony, Biden will participate in a Pass in Review, a military tradition where the new commander-in-chief inspects troops. He will also visit Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. A virtual parade will be held on January 21st, featuring performances by marching bands and military units from across the country.

Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez to Perform

Lady Gaga will sing the National Anthem at the inauguration ceremony, while Jennifer Lopez will perform a musical selection. The ceremony will also feature remarks from Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, and other dignitaries.

'Celebrating America' TV Special

The traditional in-person inaugural balls will be replaced by a primetime television special titled 'Celebrating America.' The special will feature performances by Katy Perry, Bruce Springsteen, John Legend, and Foo Fighters, as well as remarks from Biden and Harris. The special will be hosted by Tom Hanks and will air on multiple networks.

A Historic Inauguration Amidst Unprecedented Challenges

Biden's inauguration will be a historic event that will take place amidst unprecedented challenges. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and heightened security concerns have necessitated a scaled-back, virtual format, but the spirit of the inauguration remains strong. The ceremony will mark a peaceful transition of power and a new chapter in American history.
