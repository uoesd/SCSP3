Harris Discusses Challenges, American Rescue Plan with WSAZ

HUNTINGTON/CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) – Vice President Kamala Harris spoke exclusively with WSAZ's Amanda Barren on Tuesday, addressing challenges facing the region amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and outlining the Biden administration's American Rescue Plan (ARP).

American Rescue Plan

The ARP, signed into law by President Biden on March 11, provides $1.9 trillion in financial assistance to Americans, including $1,400 stimulus checks, extended unemployment benefits, and funding for small businesses, education, and healthcare.

"The American Rescue Plan is about meeting the moment," Harris said. "It's about providing immediate relief to families and businesses who are struggling during this pandemic."

Job Losses and Retraining

Harris acknowledged concerns over job losses in the coal, oil, and gas industries, particularly in West Virginia. She emphasized the administration's commitment to supporting workers and communities affected by the transition to clean energy.

"We are committed to creating jobs and addressing climate change," Harris said. "We believe that we can do both."

Harris suggested retraining workers towards reclaiming abandoned land mines and plugging oil and gas leaks as potential opportunities.

Energy Legislation

Senator Shelley Moore-Capito (R-WV) introduced legislation opposing President Biden's executive orders on energy, including the Protecting Our Workers and Energy Resources (POWER) Act.

"The POWER Act is about protecting West Virginia jobs and our way of life," Capito said. "We cannot afford to lose the jobs that support our families and communities."

Harris emphasized that the administration is not seeking to eliminate existing leases or negatively affect the energy industry.

"We are focused on creating jobs while addressing climate change," Harris said. "We believe that we can do both."

Vaccine Distribution

Harris addressed concerns over vaccine distribution based on state population, especially for states like West Virginia with efficient vaccination but small size.

"We are committed to ensuring that everyone has access to the vaccine," Harris said. "We have set an initial goal of vaccinating 100 million people in our first 100 days."

Child Poverty

Harris highlighted the ARP's aim to address child poverty, exacerbated by the pandemic and resulting unemployment.

"We know that the pandemic has had a devastating impact on families and children," Harris said. "The American Rescue Plan includes measures to help lift children out of poverty."

Unity

Harris called for unity, stating that though the administration is Democratic, they serve all Americans regardless of political affiliation.

"We are all in this together," Harris said. "We need to work together to overcome the challenges we face."

The ARP is expected to provide significant relief to Americans and help the economy recover from the pandemic.
