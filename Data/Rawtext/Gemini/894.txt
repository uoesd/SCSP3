Seacoast Native Flagg Transitions from Patriots to Buccaneers, Remains Loyal to Brady

North Hampton native Robert Flagg has been a loyal Tom Brady fan for as long as he can remember. Growing up in New England, he witnessed firsthand the Patriots' dominance under Brady's leadership, cheering them on to six Super Bowl victories.

However, when Brady made the unexpected move to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020, Flagg's allegiance followed suit. Now residing in Tampa, just five minutes away from Brady's home, Flagg is ready to cheer on his favorite player in Super Bowl LV against the Kansas City Chiefs.

"I've always been a Brady fan first and foremost," Flagg explained. "I'm not a huge Patriots fan, I'm a huge Tom Brady fan. So when he went to Tampa, I went to Tampa with him."

Flagg's transition from Patriots to Buccaneers fan was a natural one. He had already moved to Florida in 2014 and graduated from the University of Tampa, so the connection to the Buccaneers was already there.

"I've always had a soft spot for the Buccaneers," Flagg said. "I've been to a few games here and there, and I've always liked the atmosphere. So when Tom came here, it was a perfect fit."

Despite his relocation, Flagg maintains a close connection to his roots in New England. He still follows the Patriots and keeps up with his friends and family back home.

"I'm still a New Englander at heart," Flagg said. "I love the Patriots, I love Tom Brady, and I'm proud of where I come from."

Flagg's favorite memory of Brady's Patriots tenure is the team's comeback victory in Super Bowl LI against the Atlanta Falcons.

"That was the most incredible game I've ever seen," Flagg said. "I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. When they came back from being down 28-3, it was just unbelievable."

Brady's move to the Buccaneers was well-received by Flagg, who believes the team has a good chance of winning the Super Bowl this year.

"I think they have a great team," Flagg said. "They have a lot of weapons on offense, and their defense is really good. I think they can definitely win it all."

Flagg considers himself more of a Brady fan than a specific team fan. He believes Brady could play until his late 40s and has a goal of earning 12 rings.

"I think he can do it," Flagg said. "He's the greatest quarterback of all time, and he's still playing at a high level. I wouldn't be surprised if he wins another few Super Bowls."

As the Super Bowl approaches, Flagg is excited to see Brady play in his 10th Super Bowl, a game notably held at the home stadium of one of the participating teams for the first time.

"It's going to be a great game," Flagg said. "I'm predicting a close victory for the Buccaneers, 27-21."

Flagg is confident in Brady's ability to lead the Buccaneers to victory and is eager to witness another chapter in the legendary quarterback's illustrious career.
