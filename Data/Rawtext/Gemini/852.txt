Genesis GV80 Earns Top Safety Rating, Same Model Tiger Woods Drove in Crash

The 2021 Genesis GV80 SUV, the same model Tiger Woods was driving during his February crash in the Los Angeles area, has been named a Top Safety Pick+ by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).

At the time of Woods' crash, the GV80 had not yet undergone independent safety assessments. However, the IIHS's recent evaluation has confirmed the vehicle's high level of safety performance.

"The Genesis GV80 performed well in all of our crashworthiness and crash prevention evaluations," said Russ Rader, spokesman for the IIHS. "It earned good ratings in all six crash tests, and it comes standard with a suite of advanced safety features that helped it earn superior ratings for both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian front crash prevention."

Brian Latouf, chief safety officer for Genesis Motor North America, said the company is proud of the GV80's safety performance.

"Safety is a top priority for Genesis, and we are committed to providing our customers with vehicles that are both luxurious and safe," Latouf said. "The GV80's Top Safety Pick+ rating from the IIHS is a testament to our commitment to safety."

The GV80 comes standard with 10 airbags, forward-collision alert avoidance, lane-keeping assist, and blind-spot monitoring. It also offers a number of optional safety features, such as adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and a surround-view camera system.

The IIHS's Top Safety Pick+ award is given to vehicles that earn good ratings in all six crash tests, as well as superior ratings for both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian front crash prevention. The GV80 is one of only a few SUVs to earn this award for 2021.

The GV80 was not initially included in the IIHS's Top Safety Pick+ awards due to its newness. However, the IIHS recently added the GV80 to its list of tested vehicles, and the SUV performed well in all of the assessments.

The GV80's safety features may have contributed to saving Tiger Woods' life. Woods was seriously injured in the crash, but he is expected to make a full recovery.

"The GV80 is a very safe vehicle," Rader said. "It is equipped with a number of advanced safety features that can help to prevent crashes and reduce the severity of injuries in the event of a crash."

The importance of vehicle safety cannot be overstated. In 2019, over 36,000 people were killed in car crashes in the United States. Many of these deaths could have been prevented if the vehicles involved had been equipped with the latest safety features.

Genesis emphasizes safety in its brand and engineering. The GV80 is a testament to the company's commitment to providing customers with vehicles that are both luxurious and safe. The GV80 starts at nearly $50,000.
