Pence Breaks with Trump, Calls Harris to Offer Congratulations

WASHINGTON (AP) – Vice President Mike Pence called Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on Tuesday to offer congratulations, marking the first known contact between the outgoing and incoming administrations.

The call comes as President Donald Trump has refused to concede defeat and has made baseless claims of widespread voter fraud. Trump has not reached out to President-elect Joe Biden or invited him to the White House.

Pence, who has distanced himself from Trump since the Capitol siege, has defended Biden's win and will attend his inauguration, unlike Trump who will skip it.

The call between Pence and Harris was described as a "good call," with Pence offering his assistance.

"I congratulated her on her historic election and wished her and President-elect Biden well," Pence said in a statement. "I also assured her that I would do everything in my power to ensure a smooth and orderly transition of power."

Harris thanked Pence for his congratulations and said she looked forward to working with him during the transition.

"I am grateful for Vice President Pence's congratulations and his commitment to a smooth and orderly transition of power," Harris said in a statement. "I look forward to working with him and the Biden-Harris administration to address the challenges facing our nation."

Pence's call to Harris represents the traditional show of comity between outgoing and incoming leaders that Trump has flouted.

Biden said he would be "honored" to have Pence attend his inauguration, underscoring the importance of maintaining historical precedents for peaceful transfer of power.

"I think it's important that we do everything we can to make sure that the transfer of power is smooth and orderly," Biden said. "And I think that's what the American people expect."

Pence has been fulfilling ceremonial duties since the Capitol siege, including thanking National Guard members protecting the Capitol.

He has also met with foreign leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Pence's call to Harris is a sign that he is preparing for the transition of power, even as Trump continues to make baseless claims about voter fraud.

It is unclear whether Trump will eventually concede defeat and reach out to Biden.

But Pence's call to Harris is a positive step towards a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.
