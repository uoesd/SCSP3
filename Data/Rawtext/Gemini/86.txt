Haley Breaks with Trump, Condemns Capitol Riot and Predicts Political Demise

Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley has launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump, excoriating his behavior leading up to and following the Capitol riot on January 6. In a series of interviews, Haley expressed disgust at Trump's attacks on former Vice President Mike Pence before the riot and predicted that his political career is effectively over.

"I was disgusted by what I saw," Haley said of Trump's actions. "I was disgusted by the way he was talking about Mike Pence, the way he was talking about the election."

Haley's criticism marks a significant shift in her stance toward Trump. She had previously avoided publicly challenging his false claims of election fraud, but she said she had expected him to accept his defeat after legal challenges failed.

"I thought he would step up and do the right thing," Haley said. "I thought he would say, 'You know what, I lost. I'm going to go home. I'm going to take a break.'"

Instead, Trump continued to stoke the flames of division, culminating in the Capitol riot. Haley emphasized the impact of Trump's words on his supporters and criticized his call for Pence to halt Biden's Electoral College certification.

"He put Mike Pence in a terrible position," Haley said. "He betrayed Mike Pence's loyalty and friendship."

Haley expressed deep disappointment in Trump for betraying Pence's loyalty and friendship. She said she believes Trump's political career is over, regardless of the outcome of his second impeachment trial.

"I don't think he's going to run for federal office again," Haley said. "I think he's lost his influence. I think he's lost his base."

Despite her criticism of Trump's recent actions, Haley considers the impeachment trial a 'waste of time' and believes Trump will face isolation and business losses.

"I think he's going to be isolated," Haley said. "I think he's going to lose a lot of business. I think he's going to be a pariah."

Politico's Tim Alberta suggests Haley is prepping for a 2024 presidential run based on her actions and interviews with people who know her.

"Haley is clearly positioning herself for a potential presidential run in 2024," Alberta wrote. "She's been giving speeches, doing interviews, and meeting with donors. She's also been critical of Trump, which is a sign that she's trying to distance herself from him."

Haley has not publicly announced her plans for 2024, but her recent actions suggest that she is considering a run for the presidency. If she does decide to run, she will face a crowded field of potential candidates, including Trump himself.

Haley's criticism of Trump is a sign of the growing divide within the Republican Party. Many Republicans are distancing themselves from Trump in the wake of the Capitol riot, and Haley's comments are a reflection of that trend.

It remains to be seen whether Haley will ultimately decide to run for president in 2024. However, her recent actions suggest that she is preparing for a potential run and that she is willing to challenge Trump for the leadership of the Republican Party.
