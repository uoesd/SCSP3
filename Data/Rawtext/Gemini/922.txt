Howard's Journey: From Achilles Rupture to Fatherhood and Recovery

TAMPA – For Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end O.J. Howard, the 2020 season was a tale of two halves – one marked by disappointment and injury, the other filled with joy and recovery.

Howard, who missed most of the Super Bowl-winning season due to an Achilles rupture, found solace in the birth of his daughter, Caliana Mia Howard, who became his beacon of hope during a trying time.

"It was tough, but having my daughter there, it made it a lot easier," Howard said. "She was my motivation to get back on the field."

Before the injury, Howard was having the best start to a season in his career. He had caught 16 passes for 211 yards and three touchdowns in the first four games before suffering the season-ending injury in a game against the Los Angeles Chargers.

"I felt like I was kicked in the back of the leg," Howard recalled. "I knew right away that it was serious."

Howard had a history of injuries, but he had taken extra steps in fitness and focus, especially with Tom Brady joining the team.

"I was in the best shape of my life," Howard said. "I was feeling really good about the season."

The birth of his daughter brought Howard joy and allowed him full-time parenting during his injury recovery.

"It was a blessing in disguise," Howard said. "I got to be there for every moment of her life."

Howard comes from a family-rich environment in Prattville, Ala., which has always been surrounded by children.

"I love being around kids," Howard said. "It's one of the reasons I'm so excited to be a father."

Howard appreciated the unique opportunity to be present during the early months of his daughter's life, unlike many athletes during the season.

"It's been an amazing experience," Howard said. "I'm so grateful that I've been able to be there for her."

He spent rehab time with Vita Vea, and though he missed playing, Howard found solace in his daughter and the team's success.

"It was tough to watch the team win without me," Howard said. "But I was so proud of them."

Howard is nearing the end of his rehab and looks forward to contributing to the team and making new memories with his daughter.

"I'm excited to get back on the field," Howard said. "But I'm also excited to continue watching my daughter grow."

Howard's girlfriend, Chanel Sideboard, has been a constant source of support throughout his journey.

"He's been through a lot," Sideboard said. "But he's never given up."

Sideboard said that Howard's daughter has brought him a new sense of purpose.

"She's his everything," Sideboard said. "He's an amazing father."

Howard is grateful for the support of his family, friends, and teammates.

"I wouldn't be where I am today without them," Howard said. "I'm so blessed."

Howard's story is a reminder that even in the face of adversity, there is always hope. With the love of his family and the support of his team, Howard is ready to overcome any challenge and achieve his dreams.
