Colorado Springs Schools Targeted by Unfounded Threats

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) – Two Colorado Springs schools were the subject of social media threats on Monday, prompting an investigation by the Colorado Springs Police Department (CSPD).

Chinook Trail Middle School and Chinook Trail Elementary School, which share a campus on the northeast side of Colorado Springs, were the targets of the threats.

"We received information about a potential threat to our schools this morning," said Allison Cortez, spokesperson for Academy District 20, which oversees the schools. "We immediately contacted the Colorado Springs Police Department, who investigated and determined that there was no credible threat."

CSPD identified the students involved in the threats and found that they were not credible. However, parents were allowed to keep their children home from school on Monday if they wished.

"The safety of our students and staff is our top priority," said Lt. James Sokolik of CSPD. "We take all threats seriously and investigate them thoroughly."

The increased number of school threats in recent weeks has been attributed to the recent national incidents, such as the Michigan high school shooting.

"We are aware of the recent incidents across the country and are taking steps to ensure the safety of our schools," said Tom Andrew, principal of Chinook Trail Middle School. "We have increased security measures and are working closely with the police department."

Pat Schumaker, principal of Chinook Trail Elementary School, echoed Andrew's sentiments.

"We are committed to providing a safe and secure learning environment for our students," said Schumaker. "We are working with the police department to investigate these threats and take appropriate action."

However, the investigation was hindered by misinformation and rumors spreading on social media.

"There were a lot of rumors circulating on social media, including outdated photos that were misinterpreted as threats and an unfounded 'hit list,'" said Sokolik. "This made it difficult for us to investigate the threats and determine their credibility."

The police department is urging the public to report any incidents through official channels, such as Safe2Tell, rather than spreading rumors on social media.

"Safe2Tell is a confidential reporting system that allows students and community members to report threats or suspicious activity," said Sokolik. "It is a valuable tool for keeping our schools safe."

Cortez also emphasized the importance of reporting threats through official channels.

"We encourage parents and students to report any threats or suspicious activity to the school or to Safe2Tell," said Cortez. "This helps us to investigate the threats and take appropriate action."

The schools remained open on Monday, with increased security measures in place.

"We understand that these threats can be unsettling, but we want to assure parents and students that we are taking every precaution to ensure their safety," said Andrew.

Schumaker added, "We are grateful for the support of the police department and the community. We are all working together to keep our schools safe."
