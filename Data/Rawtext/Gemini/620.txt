Harris' Approval Rating Plummets to Historic Low of 28%, Biden's Sinks to 38%

Vice President Kamala Harris' approval rating has plummeted to a historic low of 28%, according to a new USA Today/Suffolk University poll, marking an unprecedented level of unpopularity for a modern vice president.

The poll, conducted among 1,000 registered voters nationwide, found that a majority of 51% disapprove of Harris' job performance. This represents a significant decline from her approval rating of 49% in April.

President Joe Biden's approval rating has also hit a new low of 38%, with 59% of respondents disapproving of his performance.

Harris' approval rating is particularly low compared to previous vice presidents at this point in their tenure. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, previously the most unpopular US vice president with a low of 30%, is slightly less unpopular than Harris at the same point in his tenure.

Harris has been tasked with several challenging assignments, including managing the migration surge of asylum seekers at the southern border. However, her handling of these issues has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.

Aides to Harris are reportedly concerned about the 2024 presidential election and potential competition from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has emerged as a popular figure within the Democratic Party.

The poll's results were published in a story by Business Insider, available exclusively to its subscribers. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

Harris' low approval rating is a reflection of the challenges facing the Biden administration, which has been grappling with a range of issues, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, economic uncertainty, and political polarization.

The administration's handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal and the ongoing crisis at the southern border have also contributed to the decline in public support.

It remains to be seen whether Harris can improve her approval ratings in the coming months. However, the poll's results suggest that she faces an uphill battle in regaining the public's trust.
