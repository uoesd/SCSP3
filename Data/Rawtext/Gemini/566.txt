Kabul Airport Reopens, Facilitating Departures of Western Nationals

Kabul, Afghanistan - Scores of Afghan dual nationals, including Americans and citizens of other Western countries, have departed Kabul via the newly reopened airport, marking a significant development in the ongoing evacuation efforts.

The departures were facilitated by the United States, with Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad playing a key role in negotiations with the Taliban. "We have been pressing the Taliban to allow the departure of all American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and Afghans who worked with us," Khalilzad said.

National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne confirmed the U.S.'s role in the departures. "The United States facilitated the departure of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents from Kabul today," Horne stated.

The Taliban, who have been in control of Kabul since August 15, have been cooperative in facilitating the departures, demonstrating a degree of flexibility and professionalism. "The Taliban have been cooperative in allowing the departures," Horne said. "They have shown flexibility and professionalism in working with us to facilitate these departures."

Qatari and Taliban officials announced that Kabul airport is nearly fully operational after repairs. "Kabul airport is now nearly fully operational," said Qatari special envoy Mutlaq al-Qahtani. "We are working with the Taliban to ensure that the airport is safe and secure for all travelers."

Al-Qahtani emphasized the transition from 'evacuation' to normal travel for those with valid documents. "We are now moving from an evacuation phase to a normalization phase," al-Qahtani said. "We encourage all those with valid travel documents to use the airport to depart Afghanistan."

However, planes in Mazar-e Sharif meant to evacuate at-risk Afghans have been unable to leave due to Taliban restrictions and technical issues. "We have been unable to get our planes out of Mazar-e Sharif due to Taliban restrictions and technical issues," said a U.S. official. "We are working with the Taliban to resolve these issues."

Taliban Actions and International Reactions

In recent days, the Taliban have announced an interim government, cracked down on protests, and requested the U.S.'s blacklist of their new interim interior minister be removed.

"We have announced an interim government," said Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi. "We are committed to forming an inclusive government that represents all Afghans."

The Taliban's actions have drawn mixed reactions from the international community. Some countries have expressed concerns over the Taliban's promises on government formation and treatment of protesters and journalists.

"We are concerned about the Taliban's crackdown on protests and the treatment of journalists," said a spokesperson for the European Union. "We urge the Taliban to respect the rights of all Afghans."

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the U.S. is "watching the Taliban's actions closely." "We are committed to holding the Taliban accountable for their actions," Austin said.

Former President Ghani's Denial

Former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who fled the country as the Taliban advanced on Kabul, has denied fleeing with millions of dollars. "I did not flee with millions of dollars," Ghani said in a statement. "I am open to a U.N. investigation into my departure."

Ghani's denial comes amid allegations that he fled with millions of dollars from the Afghan treasury. The U.N. has not yet announced whether it will investigate Ghani's departure.
