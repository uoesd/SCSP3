National Guard Deployment Hampered by Pentagon Restrictions, Delays

WASHINGTON (AP) – The Defense Department imposed unusual restrictions on the National Guard in the lead-up to the Capitol riot and delayed sending assistance, according to testimony before a Senate committee.

Maj. Gen. William Walker, Commanding General of the District of Columbia National Guard, told the Senate Rules Committee that he received a call from the Pentagon on January 5, 2021, requesting that he prepare his troops for possible deployment to the Capitol. However, he was instructed that the troops could not be armed and could only be used for traffic control and crowd management.

"I was surprised by the restrictions," Walker said. "I had never received such restrictions before."

Walker also testified that he was told by Pentagon officials that the National Guard would not be deployed until after the Capitol Police had exhausted all of their own resources. This delay resulted in the National Guard arriving at the Capitol hours after the first request for help.

"We could have been there sooner," Walker said. "But we were not allowed to."

Pentagon officials have defended their actions, saying that they were concerned about the optics of a substantial National Guard presence at the Capitol.

"We did not want to create the impression that we were militarizing the Capitol," said Robert Salesses, a senior Pentagon official.

However, the Senate hearings have revealed a series of mishandlings and lack of preparation by law enforcement in the lead-up to the Capitol riot.

The FBI has faced scrutiny for not adequately sharing intelligence warnings of violence. Jill Sanborn, the bureau's top counterterrorism official, admitted that the FBI did not share a specific threat assessment with the Capitol Police that warned of a possible attack on January 6.

"We should have done more," Sanborn said.

The Capitol Police were also aware of a possible plot by a militia group to breach the Capitol again. However, Acting Chief of Police Robert Contee said that the department did not have enough resources to prevent the attack.

"We were overwhelmed," Contee said.

The controversy over the exact timeline and approval process for National Guard deployment on January 6 is likely to continue. Officials have blamed one another for the security failures, and congressional investigations are focusing on both the security failures and the motivations behind the Capitol riot.

"We need to get to the bottom of what happened," said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). "We need to make sure that this never happens again."
