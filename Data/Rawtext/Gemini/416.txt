Chauvin Hires New Attorney for Appeal in George Floyd Case

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, has hired attorney William Mohrman to represent him in his appeal.

Mohrman filed a document with the court indicating his representation of Chauvin, who was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. Chauvin was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison.

Chauvin's appeal seeks to overturn his conviction on 14 grounds, including claims of an unfair trial location and the lack of jury sequestration. His request for a public defender to represent him on appeal was denied due to an assessment of his assets.

Chauvin's legal representation has been funded by the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association's legal defense fund. Mohrman's firm, Mohrman & Kaardal, has been involved in controversial lawsuits, including an attempt to vacate the 2020 presidential election results.

The firm also represents Minnesota health care workers suing over COVID-19 vaccine mandates. A federal judge recently denied a temporary restraining order related to the vaccine mandate lawsuit.

Chauvin also faces federal charges for violating George Floyd's civil rights, to which he has pleaded not guilty. His trial in that case is scheduled for March 7.

Mohrman has previously represented clients in high-profile cases, including former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor, who was convicted of third-degree murder in the fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk Damond.

Chauvin's appeal is expected to be complex and lengthy. The Minnesota Court of Appeals has not yet set a date for oral arguments.
