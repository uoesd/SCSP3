Schrader Apologizes for 'Lynching' Comparison in Impeachment Debate

Oregon Congressman Kurt Schrader has apologized for comparing the potential impeachment of President Trump to a "lynching."

The controversial comment was made during a House Democratic caucus call on Tuesday, where Schrader expressed opposition to impeaching Trump for inciting the Capitol riot.

"I'm not going to support impeachment," Schrader said. "This is a lynching. This is a political lynching."

Schrader's remarks drew swift condemnation from his former political consultant, Mark Wiener.

"I was shocked and appalled by his comments," Wiener said. "To equate impeachment with lynching is deeply offensive and insensitive, especially given the insurrection's clear ties to white supremacy."

U.S. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Portland, also criticized Schrader's remarks.

"Congressman Schrader's comments were hurtful and insensitive," Bonamici said. "Our nation has a long and painful history of lynching, and to compare impeachment to such a heinous crime is deeply inappropriate."

Schrader apologized for his comments on Wednesday, acknowledging the historical context and insensitivity of his words.

"I deeply regret my choice of words," Schrader said. "I understand the pain and harm that my comments have caused, and I take full responsibility for them."

Schrader has begun reaching out to colleagues to express understanding of the harm caused and to rebuild trust.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, announced plans to impeach President Trump on Wednesday, urging his immediate resignation.

"The President of the United States incited an insurrection against the United States," Pelosi said. "He must be held accountable."

Schrader, a moderate Democrat, has previously diverged from party lines, notably on stimulus check increases. Despite a primary challenge, Schrader was reelected in November, representing a district including Portland suburbs and parts of Oregon.

Schrader's apology comes amid growing pressure from Democrats to hold Trump accountable for his role in the Capitol riot. The House is expected to vote on impeachment on Wednesday, and the Senate will hold a trial to determine whether to remove Trump from office.
