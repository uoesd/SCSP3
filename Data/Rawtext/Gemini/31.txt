Taiwan's Presence at Biden's Inauguration Signals Strong US Ties

Taipei (Reuters) – Taiwan's de facto ambassador in Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim, attended the inauguration of President Joe Biden with an official invitation, a move that signals strong ties between the two countries.

Hsiao's presence at the inauguration is seen as a continuation of the increased support for Taiwan under the Trump administration, which included arms sales and visits by senior officials. These actions angered China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory.

There were concerns in Taiwan that Biden might not continue the same level of support, but the White House National Security Council has stated that the U.S. commitment to Taiwan is "rock-solid."

"Our commitment to Taiwan is rock-solid and we will continue to support Taiwan's self-defense capabilities," said Emily Horne, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council.

Taiwan's foreign ministry highlighted that the formal invitation to the inauguration was a first and demonstrated the close friendship based on shared values of democracy, freedom, and human rights.

"This is the first time that Taiwan has received an official invitation to attend the U.S. presidential inauguration," said Joanne Ou, spokeswoman for Taiwan's foreign ministry. "It shows the close friendship between Taiwan and the United States and our shared values of democracy, freedom, and human rights."

The United States formally ended diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979 in favor of China but remains legally bound to assist Taiwan in its defense.

Hsiao expressed honor in representing Taiwan at the inauguration, emphasizing democracy and freedom as common objectives.

"It is a great honor to represent Taiwan at President Biden's inauguration," said Hsiao. "We share the common objectives of democracy, freedom, and human rights."

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen congratulated the U.S. and expressed hopes for continued cooperation on regional democracy, freedom, peace, and stability.

"Congratulations to President Biden and Vice President Harris on their inauguration," said Tsai. "We look forward to working with the new U.S. administration to promote regional democracy, freedom, peace, and stability."

Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has expressed favor for greater engagement with Taiwan.

"I believe that we need to engage more closely with Taiwan," Blinken said during his confirmation hearing. "Taiwan is a vibrant democracy and a key partner in the Indo-Pacific region."

Tsai and Blinken met in 2015, indicating a pre-existing relationship between the current administration and Taiwan.

"I had the pleasure of meeting with President Tsai in 2015," said Blinken. "I was impressed by her commitment to democracy and her vision for Taiwan's future."
