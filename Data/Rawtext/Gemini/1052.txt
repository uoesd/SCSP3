Body Found in Wyoming Believed to Be Missing Gabby Petito

MOOSE, Wyo. (AP) – A body discovered in Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National Forest is believed to be that of Gabrielle "Gabby" Petito, the 22-year-old woman who vanished while on a cross-country trip with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie.

The FBI announced the discovery Sunday after a two-day search of campgrounds in the area. The cause of death has not yet been determined, according to FBI Supervisory Special Agent Charles Jones.

"Full forensic identification has not been completed to confirm 100% that we found Gabby, but our belief is that it is her," Jones said. "The family has been notified of this discovery."

Petito's family has requested privacy as they grieve, according to their attorney, Richard Benson Stafford.

"We ask that the family's privacy be respected at this difficult time," Stafford said. "We will be making no further statements and we ask the public and the press to do the same."

Parts of Grand Teton National Park and surrounding areas have been closed amid ongoing investigations. Authorities are seeking information from anyone who may have seen Petito or Laundrie near the campgrounds.

Laundrie, who is considered a person of interest in the case, returned to his parents' home in North Port, Florida, on September 1 without Petito. He has since disappeared, and a massive search is underway for him in the Carlton Reserve, a 25,000-acre nature preserve in Sarasota County.

Over 50 law enforcement officers are involved in the search for Laundrie, including the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, and local police.

Petito and Laundrie embarked on their cross-country trip in July, documenting their travels on social media. Petito's last known contact with her family was on August 25, when she sent a text message from Grand Teton National Park.

Her family reported her missing on September 11, after she failed to return home as planned.

The discovery of Petito's body has sent shockwaves through the nation, and many are expressing their condolences to her family and friends.

"Our hearts are broken for Gabby's family and friends," Jones said. "We will continue to do everything we can to find Brian Laundrie and bring him to justice."

Anyone with information about Petito's or Laundrie's whereabouts is urged to contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324).
