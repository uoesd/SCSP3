Tragic Shooting at Michigan High School Leaves Four Students Dead, Seven Injured

Oxford, Michigan - A horrific shooting at Oxford High School in Michigan has left four students dead and seven others, including a teacher, injured. The 15-year-old suspect, Ethan Crumbley, is in custody and has been charged as an adult with multiple counts, including murder and terrorism.

Swift Law Enforcement Response

Law enforcement responded swiftly to the incident, arriving at the school within three minutes of receiving the first call. The suspect surrendered without firing at police, and was taken into custody.

"Our deputies were on scene within three minutes," said Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard. "The suspect was apprehended within minutes of our arrival."

Devastating Toll

The shooting has left the community reeling. The four students who lost their lives have been identified as Tate Myre, Hana St. Juliana, Madisyn Baldwin, and Justin Shilling. The injured students and teacher are currently receiving medical attention.

Suspect's Motive

Investigators have uncovered evidence indicating that Crumbley planned the attack in advance. They have found videos and a journal in which he expressed his intent to shoot up the school.

"We have recovered a significant amount of digital evidence, including videos and a journal," said Undersheriff Michael McCabe. "These items indicate that the suspect had been planning this attack for some time."

Weapon and Ammunition

The weapon used in the shooting was a 9 mm Sig Sauer pistol, which was purchased by the suspect's father, James Crumbley, just four days before the attack.

"The weapon was purchased by the suspect's father on November 26th," said Sheriff's Lieutenant Tim Willis. "We are investigating why the father purchased the gun and whether he knew of his son's intentions."

Prior Warnings

Two teachers had reported concerning behavior by Crumbley close to the shooting date. This led to two meetings with him, including one with his parents just hours before the attack.

"We had two teachers who reported concerning behavior by the suspect," said Sheriff Bouchard. "We had two meetings with the suspect, including one with his parents, just hours before the shooting."

Parents Charged

Crumbley's parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, have been charged with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly failing to secure the gun used in the shooting. They were arrested after being considered fugitives.

"We believe that the parents should have known that their son was dangerous and that they failed to take reasonable steps to prevent this tragedy," said Oakland County Prosecutor Karen D. McDonald.

Chilling Account

Prosecutors and law enforcement have detailed a chilling account of the shooting, describing it as "methodical" and "cold-hearted."

"The suspect entered the school and immediately began shooting," said Prosecutor McDonald. "He fired multiple rounds into each classroom, targeting students and staff."

No Body Armor

Investigators have confirmed that the suspect was not wearing body armor during the shooting.

"We have no indication that the suspect was wearing body armor," said Lieutenant Willis. "He was wearing normal clothing."

Sole Suspect

Investigators have determined that there was only one shooter involved in the attack.

"We have no evidence to suggest that there was anyone else involved in this shooting," said Sheriff Bouchard. "We believe that the suspect acted alone."

Community in Mourning

The Oxford community is in mourning following the tragic shooting. Residents have gathered for vigils and memorials to honor the victims and support the survivors.

"This is a devastating loss for our community," said Sheriff Bouchard. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families."

Call for Gun Control

The shooting has reignited calls for stricter gun control measures. Many lawmakers and community leaders have expressed their support for legislation that would limit access to firearms.

"We need to do more to prevent these senseless tragedies," said Prosecutor McDonald. "We need to pass common-sense gun control laws that will keep our children safe."

Ongoing Investigation

The investigation into the shooting is ongoing. Law enforcement is continuing to gather evidence and interview witnesses.

"We are committed to finding out everything we can about this tragedy," said Sheriff Bouchard. "We will leave no stone unturned in our pursuit of justice for the victims."
