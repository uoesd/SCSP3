Australia Suspends Afghanistan Evacuations After Deadly Suicide Bombings

CANBERRA, Aug 27 (Reuters) – Australia has halted evacuation flights from Afghanistan following deadly suicide bombings outside Kabul airport, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Friday.

The attacks, claimed by the Islamic State group, killed scores of civilians and at least 13 U.S. military personnel. Australian military personnel were evacuated from Kabul hours before the explosions.

"The situation has deteriorated significantly in the last 24 hours," Morrison said. "It is now not possible to guarantee the safety of our people on the ground."

Australia's evacuations will shift to a post-evacuation phase, focusing on a humanitarian program to assist Afghans who have worked with Australia or are vulnerable.

"We will continue to do everything we can to help those who have helped us," Morrison said.

Despite Australia's suspension, some Western countries have accelerated evacuations, with flights still departing from Kabul.

"We are aware that there are still some Australian visa holders in Afghanistan," Foreign Minister Marise Payne said. "We are working to determine their exact numbers."

Morrison warned that Australians and visa holders are unlikely to get seats on remaining flights.

"We must be realistic about the risks involved," he said. "We cannot guarantee the safety of our people on the ground."

Australia has evacuated 4,100 citizens and Afghans with visas in the last nine days.

Payne advised Australians and visa holders to avoid the airport due to the risk of further attacks.

"We urge all Australians and visa holders to follow the advice of our officials," she said.

Australia is seeking to determine if any citizens or residents were among the casualties of the Kabul attacks.
