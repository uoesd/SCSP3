Norco Community Pays Tribute to Fallen Marine Lance Cpl. Kareem Nikoui

ONTARIO, Calif. (KABC) – Thousands of people lined the streets of Norco on Thursday to pay their final respects to U.S. Marine Lance Cpl. Kareem Grant Nikoui, who was killed in the Kabul airport bombing on Aug. 26.

Nikoui's remains were escorted from Ontario International Airport to Crestlawn Mortuary in a "Fallen Hero Procession." The procession included law enforcement vehicles, fire trucks, and motorcycles, as well as a hearse carrying Nikoui's flag-draped casket.

A funeral for Nikoui is planned for Saturday. Remembrance ceremonies are also being held for another local Marine, Cpl. Hunter Lopez, who died in the same attack.

People of all ages lined the streets to honor Nikoui's sacrifice, many holding American flags and signs expressing their gratitude. Veterans were among those who came to pay their respects, expressing outrage and sadness at the loss of a young Marine.

"It's just heartbreaking," said one veteran. "He was just a kid."

The attack has also sparked discussions about the security and consequences of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Nikoui was providing security during the evacuation efforts when he was killed.

"He was a hero," said Nikoui's father, Steve Nikoui. "He died doing what he loved."

The community's participation in the procession reflected the broad support and mourning for the fallen Marine.

"We're here to show our support for the family and to let them know that we're grateful for their son's sacrifice," said one resident.

Nikoui's death has left a deep void in the Norco community. He was a 2019 graduate of Norco High School and was known for his infectious smile and love of life.

"He was a great kid," said his former high school football coach, Todd Gerhart. "He was always smiling and always had a positive attitude."

Nikoui's family has asked for privacy during this difficult time. They have also requested that donations be made to the Kareem Nikoui Memorial Fund, which will support scholarships for Norco High School students.
