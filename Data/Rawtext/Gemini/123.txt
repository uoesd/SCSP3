Kathy Hochul Makes History as New York's First Female Governor

Albany, NY - Kathy Hochul was sworn in as New York's first female governor on Tuesday, succeeding Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amid a barrage of scandals.

Hochul, a former lieutenant governor under Cuomo since 2015, inherits a state grappling with numerous challenges, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the distribution of rental assistance, and the potential extension of an eviction moratorium.

In her inaugural address, Hochul pledged to restore trust in state government and distance herself from the Cuomo administration, which was marred by allegations of sexual harassment and criticism over its handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes.

"We must turn the page on the scandals of the past and build a new era of transparency, accountability, and integrity," Hochul declared.

Breaking from Cuomo's Legacy

Hochul promised to remove any aides implicated in unethical practices as reported by the state attorney general's investigation into Cuomo's administration. She also pledged to reinforce ethics in Albany and support legislation for worker protections and oversight.

"We will not tolerate corruption or abuse of power," Hochul said. "We will hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards."

Challenges Ahead

Despite her promises of reform, Hochul faces significant challenges. The state is still grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed over 55,000 lives in New York. The distribution of rental assistance has been slow, leaving many tenants at risk of eviction. And the eviction moratorium is set to expire in October, potentially leading to a wave of evictions.

"The challenges facing Governor Hochul are immense," said Kenneth Sherrill, Professor Emeritus of Political Science at Hunter College. "She needs to address the pandemic, the economy, and the housing crisis, all while restoring trust in government."

Potential Conflicts of Interest

Questions have also been raised about potential conflicts of interest involving Hochul's husband, William Hochul Jr., who works for Delaware North, a company that has contracts with the state.

Hochul has emphasized her commitment to ethics and noted measures to prevent conflicts of interest regarding her husband's position. She has pledged to recuse herself from any decisions involving Delaware North and to have her husband divest from any state contracts.

"I am committed to the highest ethical standards," Hochul said. "I will not allow any conflicts of interest to interfere with my duties as governor."

Political Background

Hochul, a moderate Democrat, has roots in conservative Western New York. She served in the House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013 and was elected lieutenant governor in 2014.

Her tenure as governor will likely face scrutiny from both progressives and potential gubernatorial candidates as the next election approaches.

"Governor Hochul will need to balance the demands of different constituencies," said Erica Vladimer, Co-founder of the Sexual Harassment Working Group. "She needs to address the concerns of progressives while also appealing to moderate voters."

Scrutiny and Support

John Kaehny, Executive Director of Reinvent Albany, a government watchdog group, said Hochul's administration will be under close scrutiny.

"Governor Hochul has promised to restore trust in government," Kaehny said. "We will be watching closely to see if she delivers on that promise."

Despite the challenges, Hochul has expressed optimism about her ability to lead New York.

"I am confident that we can overcome these challenges and build a better future for all New Yorkers," Hochul said. "I am ready to get to work."
