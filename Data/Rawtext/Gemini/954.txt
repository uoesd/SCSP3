Meghan McCain Calls for Trump's Impeachment, Sparking GOP Infighting

Phoenix, Arizona - Meghan McCain, co-host of ABC-TV's "The View," has joined the chorus of voices calling for the impeachment of former President Donald Trump, citing his role in inciting the January 6th storming of the U.S. Capitol.

"I believe that Donald Trump incited an insurrection," McCain said on the show. "I believe that he is a danger to our democracy, and I believe that he should be held accountable."

McCain's stance on Trump's impeachment is a departure from many within the Republican Party, which has largely remained loyal to the former president. However, McCain emphasized her commitment to the party and identified herself as a lifelong conservative.

"I am a Republican, and I believe in the Republican Party," she said. "But I also believe that we need to stand up for what is right, even when it is unpopular."

McCain also criticized the age of current Republican members of Congress, suggesting it impacts their concern for the party's future.

"We have a lot of old people in the Republican Party," she said. "And I think that they are not as concerned about the future of the party as they are about their own careers."

The McCain family has a history of conflict with Trump, including public feuds and Cindy McCain's endorsement of Joe Biden in the presidential election. The Arizona Republican Party censured Cindy McCain for her endorsement.

Despite the internal divisions within the GOP, McCain defended Trump supporters against comments made by Katie Couric, who suggested they need to be "deprogrammed."

"I think that is a very dangerous and harmful thing to say," McCain said. "It is not helpful to demonize people who voted for Donald Trump."

McCain expressed anger over the implication that all Trump supporters or conservatives are similar to extremist figures such as Marjorie Taylor Greene or Jake Angeli.

"I am a conservative, and I am not a Marjorie Taylor Greene," she said. "I am not a Jake Angeli. I am a normal person who believes in the Republican Party."

The Republican Party is currently experiencing infighting, especially between Reps. Matt Gaetz and Liz Cheney over Trump's impeachment. Gaetz has called for Cheney, who voted to impeach Trump, to step down from her position.

McCain finds the internal conflicts within the GOP entertaining but unproductive.

"I think it is very entertaining," she said. "But I also think it is very sad. We need to be focused on winning elections, not on fighting with each other."

McCain's call for Trump's impeachment and her criticism of the Republican Party have sparked a range of reactions. Some have praised her for speaking out against Trump, while others have accused her of betraying the party.

Despite the controversy, McCain remains steadfast in her beliefs.

"I am not going to be silenced," she said. "I am going to continue to fight for what I believe in."
