COVID-19 Booster Shots Poised to Generate Billions for Vaccine Makers

NEW YORK, Aug 13 (Reuters) – Pfizer Inc, BioNTech SE, and Moderna Inc are poised to earn billions of dollars from COVID-19 booster shots, potentially echoing the $6 billion annual flu vaccine market.

Governments in Chile, Germany, and Israel have started offering booster shots due to concerns over the Delta variant, despite ongoing debates on their necessity.

Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna have secured over $60 billion in sales for 2021 and 2022, including initial vaccines and potential boosters. Revenue forecasts for Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna in 2023 from boosters alone are over $6.6 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively.

"We believe that a third dose will likely be needed within 6 to 8 months after the primary series for an optimal immune response," said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. "We expect regular boosters to be part of the endemic COVID-19 landscape, much like the annual flu vaccine."

Evidence of waning antibody levels and breakthrough infections support the need for boosters, yet the extent of necessity remains debated.

"The data on waning immunity is clear, but the question is how much waning is too much," said Stephen Hoge, President of Moderna.

There's also uncertainty on how many people will need boosters and how competition will affect the booster shot market.

"The booster market could mimic the flu shot market, with developed country vaccination rates around 50% and notable competition keeping prices in check," said Dave Ross, Executive at CSL's flu vaccine unit Seqirus.

Pfizer and Moderna initially may have greater pricing power for their boosters until more competitors enter the market.

"Pfizer and Moderna have the advantage of being first to market with their boosters, which could give them some pricing power," said Steve Chesney, Analyst at Atlantic Equities.

However, the U.S. government paying for the shots could prevent price increases, with efforts underway to test mix-and-match booster strategies.

"The U.S. government is currently paying for the shots, which could limit price increases," said Damien Conover, Analyst at Morningstar. "There's also a lot of interest in mix-and-match booster strategies, which could further increase competition."

Analysts expect the booster market to be lucrative but not as large as the initial vaccine market.

"We believe the booster market will be significant, but not as large as the initial vaccine market," said Vamil Divan, Analyst at Mizuho Securities. "There will likely be some attrition in the number of people who get boosters, and competition will keep prices in check."

"The booster market is still in its early stages, and there's a lot of uncertainty," said Bijan Salehizadeh, Managing Director at Navimed Capital. "But it's clear that the vaccine makers are poised to earn billions from boosters."
