Ivanka and Jared's Country Club Conundrum: Indian Creek Resistance

Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner's move to Miami's exclusive "Billionaire's Bunker" has hit a snag: their application for membership in the prestigious Indian Creek Country Club. The couple purchased a $32 million residence in the enclave in December, but their admission to the club, which requires nomination and a formal application, has been met with resistance.

According to sources, members of the club have voiced objections to the couple's membership, particularly in light of the January 6 Capitol events. The club's strict admissions process allows for a single objection to halt an application, and several members have reportedly expressed their concerns.

Despite the country club difficulties, Ivanka and Jared have been welcomed by the Billionaire's Bunker community. They have received numerous dinner invitations from the largely Republican enclave, which includes prominent figures such as Carl Icahn and Norman Braman. The couple's social circle has also been enhanced by the recent purchase of a nearby mansion by Jared's brother, Josh, and his wife, Karlie Kloss.

Both couples' homes are located near Mar-a-Lago, where Donald and Melania Trump are expected to spend their post-presidential life. This proximity has fueled speculation that Ivanka Trump, who has reportedly harbored ambitions of running for president, may seek to establish a political base in Florida.

Indian Creek Country Club has faced controversies over its membership policies in the past. In 2017, the club was accused of racial discrimination after it rejected the application of a black couple. The club has since denied the allegations and stated that it does not discriminate based on race or religion.
