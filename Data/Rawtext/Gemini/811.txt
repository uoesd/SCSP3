Over 100 Million Stimulus Payments Sent by IRS

Washington CNN – The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has distributed over 100 million $600 stimulus payments, approved by Congress in December. These payments are being made through direct deposit, paper checks, and prepaid debit cards.

The IRS has issued approximately 8 million prepaid debit cards, which are being mailed to eligible recipients. These cards come in a white envelope with the Treasury Department seal and are issued by MetaBank.

The IRS warns recipients to watch for the debit cards, as some may mistake them for junk mail. The cards can be used for purchases, ATM withdrawals, and transferring funds without any fees.

To be eligible for the full $600 payment, individuals must have an adjusted gross income of less than $75,000 and couples must have an adjusted gross income of less than $150,000. The payment phases out at $87,000 for single filers and $174,000 for joint filers without children.

Undocumented immigrants without Social Security numbers are not eligible for the payments, but their spouses and children can receive payments if they have SSNs. Dependents, such as some college students, are also ineligible for the payments.

The IRS encourages individuals to check their payment status using the Get My Payment online tool. This tool allows taxpayers to track the status of their payment and provides an estimated delivery date.

The IRS emphasizes that these payments are not taxable and will not affect future tax refunds. Recipients do not need to take any action to receive their payment.

The distribution of these stimulus payments is part of the government's efforts to provide economic relief to individuals and families impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The IRS is working diligently to ensure that these payments are distributed as quickly and efficiently as possible.

If you have not received your payment and believe you are eligible, you should contact the IRS. The IRS has set up a dedicated phone line for stimulus payment inquiries at 1-800-919-9835.

The IRS reminds taxpayers that they should be cautious of scams related to the stimulus payments. The IRS will never call, text, email, or mail you asking for personal or financial information. If you receive a suspicious communication claiming to be from the IRS, do not respond and report it to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA).
