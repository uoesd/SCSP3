Jackson Police Investigate Two Deadly Shootings, Mississippi Judicial Race Oversight Changes

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) – The Jackson Police Department is investigating two separate shootings that left four people dead over the weekend.

Around 10:30 p.m. Saturday, officers responded to a shooting in the 300 block of Robinson Street. Upon arrival, they found Antoinette Robinson, 42, suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

"We don't know what led up to the shooting at this time," said Deputy Chief Deric Hearn. "We are asking for the public's help in providing any information they may have."

Around 12:30 a.m. Sunday, officers responded to another shooting in the 1400 block of Britton Street. They found three people, two men and a woman, dead from gunshot wounds.

"We believe these three victims were targeted," said Spokesperson Sam Brown. "We are following up on several leads and hope to make arrests soon."

In a separate development, the Mississippi Supreme Court has made changes to the way it oversees judicial campaigns. Previously, a five-person committee monitored judicial races for a single election year. Now, a nine-person committee will serve multiple years.

"This change is intended to address the influence of money in judicial elections," said a court spokesperson. "However, it may also reduce the amount of public information available about unethical conduct during judicial campaigns."

Judicial candidates in Mississippi are restricted in their campaign promises by the Code of Judicial Conduct. They cannot make promises about how they will rule on specific cases or promise to favor certain groups.

In national news, Ethan Crumbley, the 15-year-old charged as an adult with murder and terrorism for the shooting at Oxford High School in Michigan, appeared in court for a procedural hearing. A significant hearing is scheduled for Dec. 20 to decide on a trial.

The shooting at Oxford High School resulted in four students killed and seven others wounded. Crumbley's parents have also been charged with involuntary manslaughter.

The potential for a mental competency exam for Crumbley could put the case on hold.

The changes in Mississippi judicial race oversight aim to address the influence of money in elections but reduce public information on unethical conduct. The public is encouraged to provide any information they may have regarding the Jackson shootings to the Jackson Police Department at (601) 960-1234.
