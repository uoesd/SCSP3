Fall River Police Apologize for Controversial Facebook Post

The Fall River Police Department in Massachusetts has issued an apology for a controversial Facebook post that criticized George Floyd. The post, which was later removed, referenced Derek Chauvin's verdict and suggested that Floyd should have behaved as Chauvin did at his arrest.

"The post was insensitive and offensive, and it does not reflect the values of the Fall River Police Department," said Police Chief Jeffrey Cardoza. "We apologize to Mr. Floyd's family, friends, and the entire community for the pain and anger this post has caused."

The post, which was shared on the department's official Facebook page, sparked outrage on social media. Many people condemned the post as insensitive and disrespectful to Floyd's memory.

"This is a disgrace," wrote one user. "How can you possibly justify making such a heartless and offensive statement?"

In response to the backlash, Cardoza announced that the post had been removed and that the officer responsible had been reassigned to non-public-contact duties.

"We are also launching an external investigation into this incident," Cardoza said. "We want to make sure that this never happens again."

Cardoza emphasized that the incident does not reflect the department's values and that the department is committed to fair policing.

"We are constantly training our officers on the importance of treating everyone with respect and dignity," Cardoza said. "We will not tolerate any behavior that falls short of these standards."

Fall River Mayor Paul Coogan also condemned the post and said that the officer involved is remorseful.

"The officer has apologized for his actions and understands that he let people down," Coogan said. "He is deeply sorry for the pain and anger that his post has caused."

The incident is currently under investigation, and disciplinary actions could be taken against the officer involved.
