Note Found at Memorial High School in Madison, Wisconsin References Oxford High School Shooting

MADISON, Wis. – A note referencing the Oxford High School shooting was discovered on a bathroom floor at Memorial High School in Madison, Wisconsin during the afternoon, prompting an investigation involving the Madison Police Department and the Central Office of School Safety.

According to Principal Matt Hendrickson, "There is no security or safety risk" at the school. He assured the school community that the district takes all concerns seriously and encourages anyone with information to come forward to help maintain a safe environment.

The note was found on the same day that an 18-year-old student at La Follette High School in Madison was arrested for having a loaded gun inside the school. The student, identified as Marquan T. Webb, is facing several charges, including possession of a stolen firearm. The loaded gun found with Webb had been reported stolen out of Cottage Grove in September.

Thankfully, there were no injuries reported related to the discovery of the note or the arrest of Webb. However, the incident highlights a growing trend of copycat threats following the Oxford High School shooting, which has led to class cancellations in over a dozen Detroit school districts.

Principal Hendrickson emphasized the importance of the school community's vigilance in maintaining a safe environment, stating, "We take all concerns seriously and encourage anyone with information to come forward to help us maintain a safe environment for all students and staff."

The Madison Metropolitan School District released a statement assuring parents and guardians that they are taking the situation seriously and are working closely with law enforcement to ensure the safety of all students and staff.

The district also reminded parents and guardians to talk to their children about the importance of speaking up if they hear or see something concerning. They encouraged students to report any concerns to a trusted adult, such as a teacher, counselor, or school administrator.

The discovery of the note and the arrest of Webb come at a time when schools across the country are on high alert following a string of high-profile school shootings. The Oxford High School shooting, which occurred on November 30, left four students dead and seven others injured.

Since then, there have been numerous copycat threats and incidents, leading to class cancellations and increased security measures in schools across the country.

The incident at Memorial High School serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and the need for students, parents, and school staff to work together to maintain a safe and secure learning environment.

As the investigation continues, the Madison Metropolitan School District is urging anyone with information to come forward and share it with school administrators or law enforcement. They assure the community that they will take all necessary measures to ensure the safety and well-being of all students and staff.

In the meantime, parents and guardians are encouraged to talk to their children about the importance of school safety and the need to report any concerns they may have. By working together, schools and communities can help prevent incidents like the one at Memorial High School and ensure a safe and secure learning environment for all.
