Fort Bragg Soldier's Widow Speaks Out After Husband's Death in Kabul Airport Attack

FORT BRAGG, N.C. (WTVD) – Alena Knauss is still struggling to come to terms with the loss of her husband, Army Staff Sgt. Ryan C. Knauss, who was killed in the Kabul airport attack last week.

"It's hard to put into words how much Ryan meant to me," Alena said in an interview with WTVD. "He was my best friend, my soulmate, my everything."

Ryan C. Knauss, 29, was assigned to the 8th Psychological Operations Group at Fort Bragg. He joined the Army in 2016, the same year he and Alena got married.

"Ryan was a charismatic person who loved to help others," Alena said. "He was dedicated to his field and would have repeated his actions knowing the outcome. That's just the kind of person he was."

Alena's last message to her husband was a text expressing her love and asking for a response when he could. She never heard back.

"I knew something was wrong when I didn't hear from him," Alena said. "I tried to stay positive, but deep down, I knew something was wrong."

Ryan C. Knauss was among 13 service members who died in Kabul during an evacuation mission. The attack was carried out by a suicide bomber at the airport's Abbey Gate.

"I'm still trying to process everything," Alena said. "It's hard to believe that Ryan is gone. It feels like a nightmare that I can't wake up from."

Despite the pain of her loss, Alena said she feels gratitude for the time they shared together.

"We had so many amazing memories," Alena said. "Ryan was the love of my life, and I'm so grateful for the time we had together."

The Kabul airport attack has had a profound impact on the families of the service members who were killed. Alena said she hopes that her husband's sacrifice will not be forgotten.

"I want people to remember Ryan for the person he was – a kind, caring, and selfless individual who would do anything to help others," Alena said. "I'm so proud of him, and I'll always be grateful for the time we had together."

In a statement, the 8th Psychological Operations Group paid tribute to Ryan C. Knauss, saying, "Staff Sgt. Knauss was an outstanding soldier and a beloved member of our team. He will be deeply missed, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time."

The attack on the Kabul airport has sparked a wave of sympathy and support for the families of the victims. Alena said she has been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from friends, family, and strangers.

"It's been incredible to see how many people have reached out to offer their condolences and support," Alena said. "It's a reminder that we're not alone in this, and that there are so many people who care about us and want to help."

As Alena struggles to come to terms with her loss, she said she finds comfort in the memories she shared with her husband and the knowledge that he died doing something he loved.

"Ryan was passionate about his work, and he loved helping others," Alena said. "I know he died doing something he believed in, and that gives me some comfort in this difficult time."
