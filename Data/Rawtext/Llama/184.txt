Dustin Diamond, Screech from 'Saved by the Bell,' Dies at 44 After Battle with Lung Cancer

Dustin Diamond, the actor best known for his role as Screech on the popular 1990s sitcom "Saved by the Bell," has died at the age of 44 after a brief battle with lung cancer. Diamond passed away on Monday, just three weeks after being diagnosed with Stage 4 small cell carcinoma.

Diamond's cancer was aggressive, and he began chemotherapy shortly after his diagnosis. However, the cancer spread rapidly, and he died surrounded by his family.

Diamond was a part of "Saved by the Bell" for its entire run from 1989 to 1993 and appeared in several spinoffs. His character, Screech, was known for his geeky and lovable personality, and Diamond's performance made him a fan favorite.

However, Diamond's relationship with his castmates soured after he released an unflattering tell-all book in 2009. In the book, Diamond made controversial claims about his co-stars, including Mario Lopez and Tiffani Thiessen. However, he later made amends with his former castmates.

In an interview on "Dr. Oz," Diamond revealed that his 2006 sex tape used a stuntman and his face was added digitally. He also discussed the challenges of being a child star, noting the loss of a normal childhood.

After "Saved by the Bell," Diamond had minor roles in movies and appearances on reality and quiz shows. He was not part of the "Saved by the Bell" revival on Peacock in 2020.

Mario Lopez, who played A.C. Slater on "Saved by the Bell," paid tribute to Diamond on Instagram, saying, "My heart is broken. I'm so sad to hear about the passing of my old friend Dustin Diamond. He was a talented guy who always made me laugh. He will be missed."

Tiffani Thiessen, who played Kelly Kapowski on the show, also shared her condolences on Instagram, saying, "I'm heartbroken to hear about Dustin's passing. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends. He was a kind and caring person who will be deeply missed."

Diamond's death has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, with many stars expressing their condolences and reflecting on the fragility of life.

In a statement, Diamond's agent said, "Dustin was a talented actor who brought joy to millions of people around the world. He will be greatly missed by his friends, family, and fans."

Diamond's death serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by child stars and the importance of supporting them as they navigate the ups and downs of the entertainment industry.

Rest in peace, Dustin Diamond. Your legacy as Screech will live on in our hearts forever.
