Tucson Officer to Be Fired for Fatally Shooting Man in Wheelchair 9 Times

TUCSON, Ariz. – A Tucson police officer is facing termination and possible criminal charges after fatally shooting a 61-year-old man in a motorized wheelchair nine times from behind. The victim, Richard Lee Richards, was suspected of shoplifting a toolbox from Walmart and allegedly pulled a knife on an employee before being shot.

According to police reports, Officer Ryan Remington, who has been with the Tucson police department for four years, was working off-duty as Walmart security when he followed Richards and called for backup. The shooting took place as Richards was entering a Lowe's store, with surveillance and body camera footage capturing the event.

Tucson Police Chief Chris Magnus condemned Remington's actions as a violation of department policy and training in use of force. "The actions of Officer Remington are unacceptable and do not reflect the values and standards of our department," Magnus said in a statement. "We take incidents like this very seriously and will take appropriate action to ensure that our officers are held accountable for their actions."

Remington's attorney, Mike Storie, claimed that his client had no nonlethal options due to the placement of the wheelchair. "Officer Remington was faced with a difficult situation and had to make a split-second decision to protect himself and others," Storie said. "He did not have any other options available to him at the time."

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero called the actions "unconscionable and indefensible" and supports the investigation. "The shooting of Richard Lee Richards is a tragic reminder of the need for greater accountability and transparency in law enforcement," Romero said. "We must do better to ensure that our officers are equipped to handle situations like this in a way that respects the rights and dignity of all individuals."

The Pima County Attorney's Office is reviewing the fatal shooting for possible criminal charges against Remington. The incident follows another investigation involving an off-duty officer in Tucson, raising concerns about the use of force by law enforcement in the city.

Community leaders and activists have called for greater accountability and transparency in the wake of the shooting. "This is not the first time we've seen a tragic incident like this in Tucson, and it's time for us to take action," said local activist Carlos Sierra. "We need to make sure that our officers are properly trained and equipped to handle situations like this in a way that respects the rights and dignity of all individuals."

The Tucson Police Department has faced criticism in the past for its use of force, particularly against individuals with disabilities. In 2018, the department settled a lawsuit with a man who was wrongfully arrested and injured by police officers.

The shooting of Richard Lee Richards has sparked outrage and grief in the community, with many calling for justice and greater accountability. "This is a tragic reminder of the need for greater accountability and transparency in law enforcement," said local resident Maria Rodriguez. "We need to make sure that our officers are held accountable for their actions and that they are equipped to handle situations like this in a way that respects the rights and dignity of all individuals."

As the investigation continues, the Tucson Police Department has promised to take appropriate action to ensure that officers are held accountable for their actions. "We take incidents like this very seriously and will take appropriate action to ensure that our officers are held accountable for their actions," Magnus said.

The shooting of Richard Lee Richards is a sobering reminder of the need for greater accountability and transparency in law enforcement. As the community grapples with this tragic incident, it is clear that greater action is needed to ensure that officers are equipped to handle situations like this in a way that respects the rights and dignity of all individuals.
