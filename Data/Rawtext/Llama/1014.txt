Biden Administration Inherits Iran-Focused Social Media Campaign from Trump

The Biden administration has inherited a social media campaign focused on engaging with Iranians, which was initiated by the Trump administration. The campaign, which utilized various social media channels, was aimed at criticizing Iran's rulers and exerting "maximum pressure" on the country's clerics.

Under Trump, the State Department's Farsi-language Instagram account saw a significant increase in followers, from 147,000 in January 2019 to 759,000 in January 2021. The campaign's most engaging posts supported calls for anti-government protests and celebrated pre-Islamic Revolution Iranian cultural traditions.

Gabriel Noronha, the former manager of the State Department's Farsi social media channels, said that the campaign was designed to reach out to the Iranian people and "to give them a voice." He added, "We wanted to show that we're not just talking to the government, we're talking to the people."

Trump's Farsi tweets, particularly those in support of Iranian protests, drew significant attention and likes. However, Iran's Foreign Ministry responded negatively to Trump's tweets, criticizing the use of the Persian language in them.

Abbas Mousavi, then-Foreign Ministry spokesman, Iran, said, "The use of the Persian language in Trump's tweets was a sign of disrespect and interference in Iran's internal affairs."

The Trump administration's social media strategy built upon efforts started under the Obama administration. However, critics and observers note that Trump's approach was aggressive and sometimes dismissed or mocked by Iranians.

Nazenin Ansari, managing editor of Kayhan London and Kayhan Life, said, "The Trump administration's approach was seen as too confrontational, and it alienated many Iranians who might have otherwise been sympathetic to the message."

Holly Dagres, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, added, "The Trump administration's social media campaign was a missed opportunity. Instead of engaging with the Iranian people, it was seen as a way to provoke the government."

Alireza Nader, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said, "The Biden administration should take a different approach, one that focuses on supporting the Iranian people and their aspirations for freedom and human rights."

There is concern that the Biden administration's shift in approach might overlook human rights abuses in Iran. However, it remains to be seen how the new administration will engage with the Iranian people and address the country's human rights issues.

In conclusion, the Biden administration has inherited a social media campaign that was designed to engage with the Iranian people and criticize their rulers. While the campaign saw significant growth in followers, it remains to be seen how effective it was in achieving its goals and how the new administration will approach the issue of human rights in Iran.
