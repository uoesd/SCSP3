Prince Harry and Meghan Considered Moving to New Zealand, Reveals Governor General Patsy Reddy

In a surprising revelation, the Governor General of New Zealand, Patsy Reddy, has disclosed that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle considered moving to the country in 2018. The couple, who eventually stepped back from their royal duties and relocated to the United States, had a conversation with Reddy during their visit to the Abel Tasman national park.

According to Reddy, the conversation was informal and focused on the couple's future and family-raising plans. The discussion of relocating to New Zealand occurred less than six months after their wedding and before their move to the US.

In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, the couple mentioned considering a move to a Commonwealth country like New Zealand. However, they ultimately decided to settle in North America.

Reddy, who will leave her ceremonial role in October after a five-year term, has been a strong supporter of the monarchy. Despite some New Zealanders' republican sentiments, she believes that maintaining the monarchy is important for the country's cultural and historical heritage.

As Governor General, Reddy has the responsibility of representing the Queen in New Zealand. She takes her role seriously and sends hand-typed letters to the Queen, sharing her personal perspectives on the country.

Reddy's successor, Cindy Kiro, will be the first Indigenous woman to hold the position of Governor General. Kiro, a children's advocate, has a strong background in social work and has been a vocal advocate for children's rights.

The news of Prince Harry and Meghan's consideration of moving to New Zealand has sparked interest among the public. Many are curious about what could have been if the couple had chosen to settle in the country.

However, it is worth noting that the couple's decision to step back from their royal duties and move to the US was likely influenced by a range of factors, including their desire for greater privacy and independence.

Despite the couple's decision not to move to New Zealand, the country remains a popular destination for royal visitors. The Queen's grandson, Prince William, and his family have visited the country several times, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have also expressed their love for the country.

The revelation that Prince Harry and Meghan considered moving to New Zealand highlights the strong ties between the country and the royal family. It also underscores the importance of the monarchy in New Zealand's history and culture.

As the country continues to evolve and grow, the role of the monarchy will likely continue to be a topic of debate. However, for now, the news of Prince Harry and Meghan's consideration of moving to New Zealand serves as a reminder of the enduring connection between the two nations.

In conclusion, the revelation that Prince Harry and Meghan considered moving to New Zealand is a fascinating insight into the couple's thoughts and plans. While they ultimately decided to settle in the US, the news highlights the strong ties between New Zealand and the royal family, and underscores the importance of the monarchy in the country's history and culture.
