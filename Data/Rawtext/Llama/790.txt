Stimulus Update: IRS Sends Over 163 Million Payments, 'Plus-Up' Payments Ongoing

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued over 163 million third stimulus payments to eligible individuals and families since March, with recent "plus-up payments" being sent out to those who qualify for a higher amount based on their 2020 tax returns.

The third stimulus checks are part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, signed into law by President Joe Biden on March 11. The payments are designed to provide financial relief to those who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Under the program, individuals and families may receive up to $1,400 per qualifying member, including adult and child dependents. However, income limits apply, and payments phase out completely at $80,000 for single taxpayers, $160,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly, and $120,000 for heads of household.

Adult dependents, including college students and disabled adults, are also eligible for $1,400, subject to the same phaseouts. The IRS is using the most recent tax return on file (2019 or 2020) to determine eligibility for the stimulus payments.

The IRS has been issuing payments in weekly batches, with direct deposits and mailed checks ongoing since March 17. The agency has also been sending out "plus-up payments" to those who qualify for a higher amount based on their 2020 tax returns. These payments are in addition to the initial stimulus payment and are designed to ensure that eligible individuals receive the full amount they are entitled to.

There is currently no indication from President Biden that a fourth stimulus check will be issued. However, the IRS has emphasized that it will continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that eligible individuals receive the financial support they need.

The third stimulus payments have been welcomed by many who have been struggling financially during the pandemic. The payments are intended to help individuals and families cover essential expenses, such as rent, utilities, and food.

However, some have expressed concern that the payments may not be enough to cover the costs of living, particularly in areas with high costs of living. Others have noted that the income limits for full payments may exclude some who are still struggling financially.

Despite these concerns, the third stimulus payments have been seen as a positive step in providing financial relief to those who need it most. The IRS has emphasized that it will continue to work to ensure that eligible individuals receive their payments as quickly and efficiently as possible.

In conclusion, the IRS has sent over 163 million third stimulus payments since March, with "plus-up payments" ongoing. The payments are designed to provide financial relief to those who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While there are income limits and phaseouts, the payments are intended to help individuals and families cover essential expenses. The IRS will continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that eligible individuals receive the financial support they need.
