Michigan School Shooting Could Have Been Prevented, Prosecutor Says

A week after a deadly school shooting in Michigan that killed four students, Oakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald said that the tragedy could have been prevented if the suspect's parents had been more forthcoming about his access to firearms.

"We believe that had the parents been more forthcoming with the school about their son's access to weapons, this tragedy could have been prevented," McDonald said during a press conference.

Ethan Crumbley, 15, is accused of carrying out the shooting at Oxford High School. His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, have been charged with involuntary manslaughter for their alleged role in the shooting. Prosecutors allege that the suspected shooter's father bought the gun used in the shooting, and his mother boasted about it on social media.

The day before the shooting, school officials and Crumbley's parents had a meeting concerning violent drawings and statements made by him. However, he was allowed to return to class. The school is now facing criticism for missing multiple warning signs and not searching Crumbley's backpack, where it's believed the firearm was during the meeting.

In response to the incident, Oxford High School has plans for a "soft opening" with law enforcement present and trained clinicians to support students. However, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel expressed disappointment in the school district's decision to hire a private security firm for a safety review instead of accepting the state's offer.

The parents of the accused shooter are being held at the Oakland County Jail, separated from each other and their son to avoid interaction. A search warrant was also executed at the home of Andrzej Sikora, who is believed to have helped James and Jennifer Crumbley hide before their arrest.

Sikora's attorney, Clarence Dass, stated that his client did not assist the Crumbleys in evading law enforcement nor was he aware of their warrants at the time of their use of his workspace.

Casey Smith, a parent of an Oxford High student, expressed frustration with the school's handling of the situation. "I'm just angry that the school didn't do more to prevent this," she said.

Chris Dorn, a senior analyst at Safe Havens International, a school safety consulting firm, said that schools need to take a closer look at students who exhibit warning signs like Crumbley did. "Schools need to be more proactive in identifying students who may be a threat to themselves or others," he said.

Tim Throne, superintendent of Oxford Community Schools, said that the district is taking steps to improve school safety. "We are committed to doing everything we can to prevent a tragedy like this from happening again," he said.

Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard praised the efforts of law enforcement in apprehending the suspect and his parents. "I'm proud of the work our deputies and detectives did in bringing these individuals to justice," he said.

Paulette Michel Loftin, the court-appointed attorney for Ethan Crumbley, declined to comment on the case. Michael G. McCabe, the Oakland County Undersheriff, also declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation.

The shooting has left the community shaken and searching for answers. As the investigation continues, one thing is clear: this tragedy could have been prevented if the suspect's parents had been more forthcoming about his access to firearms.
