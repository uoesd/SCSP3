False Claim Circulates About Bill Clinton's Death, Debunked by Fact-Checking and Official Sources

A false claim circulated on social media this week, alleging that former President Bill Clinton had died at Guantanamo Bay due to poisoning. The claim was quickly debunked by official sources, including Clinton's spokesperson and the U.S. Naval Hospital in Guantanamo Bay.

According to Angel Ureña, Clinton's spokesperson, the former President was hospitalized in California for a non-COVID-related infection, specifically sepsis. Ureña confirmed that Clinton was released from the hospital and returned to New York to continue his antibiotic treatment. He also stated that Clinton's health was improving and that he was in excellent spirits.

The false claim originated from Real Raw News, a website known for publishing fake stories and conspiracy theories. The website falsely reported Clinton's death, attributing the information to an unnamed source at Guantanamo Bay and fictitious involvement of a U.S. Naval Hospital officer.

Dawn Grimes, spokeswoman for the U.S. Naval Hospital in Guantanamo Bay, refuted claims about an autopsy performed or overseen by Capt. Dale Ramirez. "There is no truth to the claim that Capt. Ramirez performed an autopsy on President Clinton or that he was involved in any way," Grimes said.

Real Raw News has a disclaimer stating its content contains humor, parody, and satire, but it's noted this is hidden on the about page. Despite the satire disclaimer, the website's content is often taken as fact by unsuspecting readers and spread rapidly on social media.

A fact-checking investigation by PolitiFact attributes these stories to Michael Ruffin, who uses the pseudonym Michael Baxter and defends the accuracy of his stories despite the satire disclaimer. Ruffin has been linked to several other fabricated stories and conspiracy theories, many of which are connected to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.

The false claim about Clinton's death is part of a broader pattern of fabricated stories about high-profile figures, often linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory. This theory posits that there is a secret group of people, known as the "Q," who have infiltrated the highest levels of government and are working to take down a cabal of powerful elites who are responsible for various evil acts.

QAnon followers believe that President Trump is secretly working with the "Q" to take down these elites and that he is sending coded messages to them through his tweets and public statements. The theory has been widely debunked and discredited, but it continues to attract followers and inspire false and dangerous claims.

In conclusion, the claim that former President Bill Clinton died at Guantanamo Bay due to poisoning is a false and dangerous fabrication. It is part of a broader pattern of fabricated stories about high-profile figures, often linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. Official sources, including Clinton's spokesperson and the U.S. Naval Hospital in Guantanamo Bay, have confirmed that Clinton was hospitalized for a non-COVID-related infection and is recovering well. It is important to fact-check information before sharing it on social media to avoid spreading false and harmful claims.
