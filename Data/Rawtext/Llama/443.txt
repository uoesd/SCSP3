Archbishop of Canterbury Confirms Harry and Meghan's Private Wedding Ceremony Was Not Legally Binding

CNN – In a shocking revelation, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has confirmed that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's private wedding ceremony, held three days before their public wedding, was not legally binding.

In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Meghan Markle revealed that the couple had a private exchange of vows on May 16, 2018, at their home in Kensington Palace. However, Welby has now clarified that the private ceremony did not have any legal standing.

"I signed the legal document on the day of their public wedding, May 19, 2018," Welby said in a statement. "The private ceremony did not have any legal witnesses, leading to speculation that it was not legally binding."

Welby emphasized that signing a false wedding certificate would have been a serious criminal offense. "I can confirm that the legal wedding ceremony took place on May 19, 2018, at St. George's Chapel in Windsor, and was witnessed by millions of people around the world," he said.

The couple's decision to have a private ceremony before their public wedding has sparked controversy, with some questioning the legitimacy of their marriage. However, Welby's confirmation that the private ceremony was not legally binding puts the matter to rest.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle officially married at St. George's Chapel in Windsor on May 19, 2018, in a ceremony that was watched by millions of people around the world. The couple stepped back from royal duties in January of the previous year, citing a desire for a more private life.

In their interview with Oprah, the couple discussed a range of topics, including racism within the royal family and Meghan's mental health struggles. One of the major revelations was concerns within the royal family about the skin color of their unborn child, Archie.

The interview allowed Harry and Meghan to speak more freely about their experiences in the royal family, and their decision to step back from their duties. The couple has since relocated to Canada, where they are building a new life for themselves and their son.

In conclusion, while the private ceremony between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may have been a romantic gesture, it was not legally binding. The couple's official marriage took place on May 19, 2018, at St. George's Chapel in Windsor, and was witnessed by millions of people around the world.
