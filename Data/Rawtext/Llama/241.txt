Nobelium, Linked to Russia, Behind Recent Cyber Attacks and SolarWinds Hack

A recent wave of cyber attacks targeting approximately 3,000 email accounts across more than 150 organizations worldwide has been linked to Nobelium, a group believed to be based in Russia. This is not the first time Nobelium has been accused of such attacks, as they were also responsible for the 2020 SolarWinds attacks.

The majority of the targeted organizations are based in the United States and are involved in international development, humanitarian, and human rights work. The attacks were initiated through an email marketing account of the United States Agency For International Development (USAID).

Both the Department of Homeland Security and USAID are investigating the hacking incidents. The SolarWinds hack, discovered in December, impacted thousands of companies and government offices globally. Microsoft President Brad Smith called the SolarWinds hack "the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen."

Russia's spy chief denied responsibility for the SolarWinds cyber attack but was "flattered" by the accusations from the US and Britain. The US and Britain have blamed Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) for the SolarWinds hack.

Microsoft indicates the attacks seem to be part of intelligence collection efforts targeted at government agencies involved in foreign policy. The recent attacks are believed to be a continuation of these efforts, with Nobelium using similar tactics to gain access to sensitive information.

The attacks have raised concerns about the vulnerability of organizations to cyber attacks and the potential for state-sponsored hacking. The US and Britain have called for greater international cooperation to address the issue and prevent future attacks.

In a statement, a spokesperson for USAID said, "We take any attempt to compromise our systems and data seriously and are working closely with our partners to address this issue."

The Department of Homeland Security also issued a statement, saying, "We are aware of the reports and are working closely with our partners to investigate and mitigate the threat."

Microsoft has advised customers to take immediate action to protect their systems and data, including implementing multi-factor authentication and updating their software.

The recent attacks highlight the ongoing threat of cyber attacks and the need for organizations to remain vigilant in protecting their systems and data. As the investigation into the attacks continues, it is clear that the issue of state-sponsored hacking is not going away anytime soon.

In conclusion, the recent cyber attacks targeting organizations involved in international development, humanitarian, and human rights work, and the SolarWinds hack, have been linked to Nobelium, a group believed to be based in Russia. The attacks have raised concerns about the vulnerability of organizations to cyber attacks and the potential for state-sponsored hacking. The US and Britain have called for greater international cooperation to address the issue and prevent future attacks.
