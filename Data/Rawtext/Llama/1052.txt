Body Found in Wyoming Believed to be Missing Woman Gabrielle Petito

MOOSE, Wyo. (AP) – A body found in a Wyoming campground is believed to be that of Gabrielle "Gabby" Petito, a 22-year-old woman who disappeared while on a cross-country trip with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie.

FBI Supervisory Special Agent Charles Jones announced that the body was discovered on Saturday, September 19, after a two-day search of campgrounds in the area. Jones stated that the cause of death has not yet been determined and that the investigation is ongoing.

Petito's family has been notified of the discovery, though full forensic identification has not been completed. In a statement, attorney Richard Benson Stafford, who represents Petito's family, requested privacy for the grieving family and thanked law enforcement agencies involved in the search.

Laundrie, who is considered a person of interest in the case, returned to his parents' home in Florida without Petito on September 1. The search for Laundrie has now expanded to the Carlton Reserve in Sarasota County, Florida, where over 50 law enforcement officers are involved in the search.

The FBI has taken the lead in the investigation, with assistance from local and state law enforcement agencies. Authorities are seeking information from anyone who may have seen Petito or Laundrie near the camp sites.

Petito and Laundrie had been traveling together since July, visiting national parks and documenting their trip on social media. Petito was last seen in Grand Teton National Park, where the body was found.

The discovery of the body has prompted the closure of parts of Grand Teton and surrounding areas as authorities continue their investigation.

The case has captured national attention, with many on social media expressing their condolences to Petito's family and calling for justice.

As the investigation continues, authorities are urging anyone with information about Petito's disappearance or Laundrie's whereabouts to come forward.

The discovery of the body in Wyoming has brought a sense of closure to Petito's family, but many questions still remain unanswered. The investigation into Petito's disappearance and death is ongoing, with authorities working tirelessly to bring justice to the family.

In a statement, Stafford thanked the public for their support and asked for continued privacy for the family during this difficult time.

The case has highlighted the dangers that women can face while traveling, and the importance of being vigilant and aware of one's surroundings.

As the search for Laundrie continues, authorities are urging anyone with information to come forward and help bring closure to this tragic case.

The investigation into Petito's disappearance and death is a reminder of the importance of cooperation between law enforcement agencies and the public in solving crimes.

The discovery of the body in Wyoming has brought a sense of closure to Petito's family, but the investigation is far from over. Authorities will continue to work tirelessly to bring justice to the family and ensure that justice is served.
