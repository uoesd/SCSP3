Trump's Digital Exile: How Social Media Bans Have Changed His Influence

In the aftermath of the Capitol riot in January, social media giants Facebook and Twitter banned Donald J. Trump from their platforms, citing public safety concerns. The move was seen as a significant blow to Trump's ability to communicate directly with his followers and shape public discourse. However, despite the ban, Trump's statements have continued to achieve broad dissemination across social networks through other popular accounts.

Facebook extended Trump's ban until at least January 2023, citing concerns about the potential for his messages to incite violence. Emerson Brooking, a Resident Fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, noted that "deplatforming can be an effective way to reduce the spread of political misinformation and the influence of harmful individuals."

An analysis of Trump's social media engagement showed a dramatic drop in likes and shares after his ban. However, some of his statements post-ban matched or exceeded pre-ban median engagement. This suggests that while the ban may have limited Trump's direct reach, his messages continue to resonate with his base and beyond.

Other social media accounts and right-leaning platforms have continued to amplify Trump's messages after his ban. Trump's criticism of conservatives, like Senator Mitch McConnell, has attracted attention from both left and right-leaning accounts. This has allowed Trump to maintain some level of influence, even in the absence of his own social media presence.

The Global Disinformation Index, a non-partisan organization that tracks and analyzes online disinformation, classified hundreds of accounts sharing Trump's statements to study political leanings and disinformation spread. Their findings suggest that Trump's messages continue to be a significant force in shaping public discourse, despite the ban.

One notable trend that has emerged is the impact of deplatforming on the spread of political misinformation. Disinformation researchers have highlighted the effectiveness of deplatforming in reducing the spread of false information and the influence of harmful individuals. Trump's case serves as a prime example of this phenomenon.

As a result of his social media bans, Trump's role has shifted to that of a 'digital leader-in-exile', influencing discussions indirectly through his statements. While he no longer has the same level of direct engagement with his followers, Trump's messages continue to be amplified and debated across social media platforms.

In conclusion, Trump's social media bans have had a significant impact on his ability to communicate directly with his followers and shape public discourse. However, his messages continue to resonate with his base and beyond, and his influence remains palpable. The ongoing debate around Trump's statements highlights the complexities of regulating online speech and the challenges of combating political misinformation in the digital age.
