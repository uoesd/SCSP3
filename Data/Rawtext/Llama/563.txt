Fallen Marine Cpl. Daegan Page to be Honored at Omaha Lancers Hockey Game

The Omaha Lancers hockey team will honor the memory of Marine Cpl. Daegan Page, who was killed in the Aug. 26 attack on Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, during their game against the Sioux Falls Stampede on Friday.

Page, a part of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton, California, was among the 13 service members who lost their lives in the attack. His love for hockey inspired Visiting Angels to choose his family for their Hometown Hero Seat during the game.

"Daegan was a huge hockey fan, and he would have loved this event," said his mother, Wendy Adelson. "It means a lot to our family to be recognized and remembered by our community in this way."

The Hometown Hero Seat acknowledges military members, first responders, or their family members, and Page's family will participate in a ceremonial puck-drop and receive a Lancers sweater in his honor.

"We are humbled to have the opportunity to honor Cpl. Page and his family," said Lancers President and General Manager, David Wilkie. "We hope that this small gesture can help them feel supported and remembered by their community during this difficult time."

A media Q&A session with the Page family will follow the puck-drop ceremony and gift presentation.

Adelson expressed her gratitude for the recognition, saying, "It's amazing to see how much support and love our community has shown us. It's a reminder that Daegan's sacrifice will never be forgotten."

The Lancers game is just one of several events and tributes planned to honor Page's memory. A memorial service was held in his hometown of Red Oak, Iowa, on Sept. 3, and a scholarship fund has been established in his name to support students interested in pursuing a career in law enforcement or the military.

"Daegan was a hero, and we will always remember him as such," said Adelson. "We hope that his story and legacy will inspire others to serve their country and community."

The Lancers game is set to begin at 7:05 p.m. on Friday, and fans are encouraged to arrive early to participate in the pre-game ceremony honoring Page.

In conclusion, the Omaha Lancers hockey game on Friday will be a special night for the Page family, as they remember their loved one and are honored by their community. The event serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by our service members and their families, and the importance of supporting and remembering them.
