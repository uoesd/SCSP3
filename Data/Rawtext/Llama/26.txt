Jesuit Priest Under Investigation for Alleged Misconduct

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) – Rev. Kevin O'Brien, a Jesuit priest who presided over President Joe Biden's inaugural Mass, is under investigation for unspecified allegations, Santa Clara University announced Thursday. O'Brien, who has a long history with the Biden family, has been placed on leave from his position as president of the university amid the investigation.

In a statement, John M. Sobrato, the board chairman of Santa Clara University, said that the allegations against O'Brien involve "behaviors in adult settings, consisting primarily of conversations," which may have violated Jesuit protocols. The nature of the allegations has not been specified publicly.

Tracey Primrose, spokeswoman for the Jesuits West Province, which oversees the investigation, emphasized that Jesuits adhere to a professional code of conduct and are expected to maintain appropriate boundaries in all interactions.

O'Brien, who joined the Society of Jesus in 1996 and was ordained in 2006, has been a prominent figure in the Jesuit community. He has known the Biden family for about 15 years and has presided over services for Biden's vice president inaugurations.

Santa Clara University, where O'Brien served as president, is a top-ranked Jesuit institution with about 5,500 undergraduate students. The university has not made public comments regarding the investigation.

O'Brien and the Jesuits West Province have also not made any public comments about the investigation. It is not clear how long the investigation will take or what the consequences might be for O'Brien if the allegations are found to be true.

The investigation comes at a time when the Catholic Church is facing increased scrutiny over its handling of sexual misconduct allegations. In recent years, several high-profile cases have raised questions about the church's ability to police itself and protect its members from abuse.

The allegations against O'Brien have sparked concern among members of the Santa Clara University community, who are eagerly awaiting the outcome of the investigation.

"We take any allegation of misconduct very seriously and will cooperate fully with the investigation," Sobrato said in his statement. "We will do everything we can to ensure that our campus remains a safe and respectful environment for all members of our community."

The investigation is a reminder that even respected religious leaders can face allegations of misconduct, and that no institution is immune to scrutiny. As the Catholic Church continues to grapple with issues of accountability, cases like O'Brien's will continue to draw attention and raise questions about the church's ability to protect its members.

In the meantime, the Santa Clara University community will wait anxiously for the outcome of the investigation, hoping that it will bring clarity and resolution to the allegations against O'Brien.
