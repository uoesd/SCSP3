Last U.S. Troops Leave Afghanistan, Ending America's Longest War

Aug 30 (Reuters) – The last U.S. troops left Afghanistan on Monday, ending America's longest war, which began on Sept. 11, 2001, after attacks in the U.S. by al Qaeda from Afghanistan.

The U.S. involvement in Afghanistan started on Oct. 7, 2001, with airstrikes against the Taliban and al Qaeda, but there was no significant initial combat deployment. However, the U.S. failed to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, when he escaped U.S. bombing in Tora Bora, Afghanistan, and fled to Pakistan in December 2001.

In May 2003, major combat operations were declared over, and the focus shifted towards Iraq, which enabled the Taliban's resurgence. However, in February 2009, President Obama increased U.S. troops in Afghanistan, exceeding 100,000 in 2010, for counter-insurgency operations.

On May 1, 2011, U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, but the war in Afghanistan continued. In May 27, 2014, Obama initiated a drawdown, focusing on training the Afghan military, planning a full withdrawal by the end of 2016.

The Trump administration signed an agreement with the Taliban on Feb. 29, 2020, for U.S. troop withdrawal, with the Taliban committing to negotiate peace. However, on Aug. 26, 2021, an ISIS suicide bomb at Kabul airport killed scores, including 13 U.S. troops.

U.S. General Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command, said in a statement, "We have completed our withdrawal from Afghanistan, and we have done it in a way that respects the sacrifice of those who have gone before us."

Despite the challenges faced during the withdrawal, McKenzie expressed pride in the U.S. military's ability to execute the mission. "We have demonstrated our commitment to the safety and security of the American people, and we have done so with the professionalism and skill that our nation expects from its military," he said.

The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan marks the end of a long and costly chapter in American history. The war has resulted in the deaths of thousands of U.S. troops and civilians, as well as billions of dollars in economic costs.

The U.S. departure from Afghanistan also raises questions about the future of the country and the region. The Taliban, who were ousted from power by the U.S. invasion in 2001, are now back in control, and their rule has been marked by human rights abuses and oppression.

The U.S. has said it will continue to support the Afghan military and government, but the withdrawal of U.S. troops has raised concerns about the ability of the Afghan military to hold off the Taliban and other extremist groups.

As the U.S. leaves Afghanistan, it also marks a turning point in U.S. foreign policy. The war in Afghanistan was launched in response to the 9/11 attacks, and it has been a defining feature of U.S. foreign policy for two decades.

The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan is a significant moment in the country's history and a reminder of the sacrifices made by U.S. troops and their families. It remains to be seen what the future holds for Afghanistan and the region, but the U.S. departure marks a new chapter in the ongoing struggle against extremism and terrorism.

In conclusion, the last U.S. troops have left Afghanistan, ending America's longest war. The U.S. withdrawal marks the end of a costly and challenging chapter in American history and raises questions about the future of the country and the region. The U.S. has said it will continue to support the Afghan military and government, but the withdrawal of U.S. troops has raised concerns about the ability of the Afghan military to hold off the Taliban and other extremist groups. The U.S. departure from Afghanistan is a significant moment in the country's history and a reminder of the sacrifices made by U.S. troops and their families.
