Tiger Woods Injured in Rollover Car Crash, Undergoes Surgery

Golf legend Tiger Woods was involved in a serious rollover car crash on Tuesday, February 23, leaving him with significant orthopaedic injuries to his right lower extremity. The crash occurred in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, and Woods was rushed to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center for treatment.

According to Dr. Anish Mahajan, the chief medical officer and interim CEO of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Woods underwent a long surgical procedure to treat his injuries. "Tiger Woods suffered significant orthopaedic injuries to his right lower extremity," Dr. Mahajan said in a statement. "The injuries were treated with a rod in the tibia and stabilization of foot and ankle with screws and pins."

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and Fire Department also provided assistance at the scene of the crash. Sheriff Alex Villaneuva stated that Woods' SUV collided with a median, crossed into oncoming traffic, and rolled over several times. "The vehicle was traveling at a greater speed than normal," Villaneuva said.

Sheriff's deputy Carlos Gonzalez was one of the first responders to arrive at the scene. "When I arrived, I saw a vehicle that had rolled over multiple times," Gonzalez said. "I saw a person lying on the ground, who was later identified as Tiger Woods. He was awake and responsive, but he was in a lot of pain."

Fire chief Daryl Osby confirmed that Woods was extricated from his vehicle using tools rather than the 'jaws of life'. "We were able to stabilize him and get him out of the vehicle," Osby said. "He was taken to the hospital for further treatment."

Woods, who has undergone five back surgeries since 2014, had hoped to return to golf in 2021. His agent, Mark Steinberg, released a statement saying, "Tiger is awake, responsive, and recovering in his hospital room. He is expected to make a full recovery, but it will take time."

The crash is currently under investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Villaneuva urged anyone who may have witnessed the crash to come forward. "We are asking anyone who may have seen the crash to contact us," he said. "We want to piece together what happened and ensure that something like this doesn't happen again."

In the meantime, the golf community has rallied around Woods, offering their support and well wishes for a speedy recovery. Woods' fellow golfers, including Jack Nicklaus and Rory McIlroy, have taken to social media to express their concern and support for the golf legend.

As Woods begins his road to recovery, fans and golf enthusiasts alike are hoping for a swift and full recovery. The golf world is eagerly awaiting the return of one of its greatest players, and with the support of his fans and medical team, Woods is sure to bounce back stronger than ever.
