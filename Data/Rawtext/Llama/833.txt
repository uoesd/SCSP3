Tiger Woods' Car Crash Raises Questions About Driver Inattention, Experts Say

In the early morning hours of February 23, golf legend Tiger Woods was involved in a single-vehicle accident in Los Angeles County, California. According to the official report, Woods' vehicle traveled straight on a curved road, went off the road, hit a tree, and rolled over, causing major damage and breaking Woods' lower right leg. While Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva and others have labeled the crash an accident, forensic car accident experts suggest that Woods may have been asleep or not paying attention before the crash.

Jonathan Cherney, a consultant and car accident analysis expert witness, said that evidence indicates Woods did not lose control due to excessive speed but rather inattention. "There were no skid marks found at the scene, which suggests that Woods didn't apply the brakes until it was too late," Cherney said. "The absence of skid marks could also be explained by the vehicle's anti-lock brakes, which may have prevented the tires from locking up and leaving marks on the road."

Felix Lee, an accident reconstruction expert at Expert Institute, agrees that inattention may have played a role in the crash. "The fact that Woods' vehicle traveled straight on a curved road and hit a tree suggests that he may have been distracted or fallen asleep at the wheel," Lee said. "A late brake application, as suggested by the lack of skid marks, supports this theory."

Rami Hashish, principal at National Biomechanics Institute, also questioned the quick determination of the crash as an accident without analyzing the vehicle's black box or Woods' medical data for medication. "It's premature to rule out impairment without conducting a thorough investigation," Hashish said. "The 2017 incident where Woods was found asleep at the wheel with several substances in his system raises questions about possible medication at the time of the crash."

Sheriff Villanueva and Sheriff's Deputy Graciela Medrano were quick to label the crash an accident, but forensic experts criticize this assessment, suggesting negligence might be involved. "The investigation is still ongoing, but the initial assessment seems to dismiss the possibility of driver inattention or negligence too quickly," Cherney said.

Woods is currently recovering from surgery and is in good spirits, with no further updates on his condition.

In conclusion, while the official report labels the crash an accident, forensic car accident experts suggest that Tiger Woods may have been asleep or not paying attention before the crash. The absence of skid marks and the late brake application support this theory, and experts criticize the quick determination without thorough investigation. The incident highlights the importance of driver attention and safety on the road.
