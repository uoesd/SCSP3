Harris Still Waiting for New Home as VP Residence Undergoes Renovations

CNN – Washington D.C. – More than two months after her inauguration, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, are still living out of suitcases at Blair House, the president's guest house, due to ongoing renovations at the vice presidential residence.

The delay in moving into the official residence has been a source of frustration for Harris, who is the first woman and the first woman of color to hold the office of vice president in the United States.

The reason behind the prolonged renovation period at the vice president's official residence is unclear. Renovations and upkeep of the 9,000-plus square feet mansion, built in 1893, include substantial government contracts for various works. Harris reportedly requested work on the kitchen, although her deputy press secretary later stated no such work is being conducted.

Historically, new vice presidents may delay moving into the official residence to allow for maintenance and upgrades. However, Harris and Emhoff are eager to settle into their new home and enjoy the privacy and informal atmosphere it offers.

Temporary accommodations at Blair House offer luxury but do not provide the casual, informal atmosphere Harris and Emhoff prefer. The vice president's residence, on the other hand, offers more privacy, fewer staff, and less formality compared to the White House.

Previous vice presidents have personalized the residence with unique features such as a heated pool and a horseshoe pit. Harris, who values fitness and cooking, looks forward to utilizing the residence's outdoor space and potentially personalizing it.

"The vice president's residence is a beautiful historic home, and we're excited to make it our own," said Sabrina Singh, deputy press secretary for Vice President Harris.

Elizabeth Haenle, former vice president residence manager and social secretary for former Vice President Dick Cheney, understands the importance of making the residence feel like home. "It's a place where the vice president and their family can relax, entertain, and host events," she said. "It's a reflection of their personal style and interests."

Despite the delay, Harris and Emhoff remain optimistic about their future home. "We're excited to move in and start making memories," Singh said.

Until then, Harris and Emhoff will continue to reside at Blair House, waiting for the day they can call the vice presidential residence their own.
