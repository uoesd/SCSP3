Twin Blasts in Kabul Raise Concerns Over Terrorism Threat in Afghanistan

The recent twin blasts outside Kabul's airport have raised concerns over the continued terrorism threat in Afghanistan, despite the Taliban's takeover of the country. U.S. officials have blamed the ISIS-affiliate in Afghanistan, ISIS-K, for the attack, promising retaliation.

"We will not be deterred by these heinous attacks," said President Biden in a statement. "We will continue to work with our partners to root out terrorism in all its forms, and we will not rest until those responsible for these attacks are brought to justice."

The attack highlights the complex and evolving nature of the terrorism threat in Afghanistan, where both ISIS-K and al-Qaeda continue to operate. While the Taliban is seen as a more moderate group compared to ISIS-K, doubts remain regarding their relationship with these extremist factions.

"The Taliban has assured us that they will not allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for terrorist groups," said Secretary of State Antony Blinken. "We will be monitoring their actions closely to ensure that they uphold their commitments."

According to Fawaz Gerges, a professor at the London School of Economics, the Taliban's relationship with al-Qaeda is complex and nuanced. "The Taliban and al-Qaeda share an ideological alignment, and there are personal relationships between the two groups," he said. "However, it's unclear whether the Taliban will be able to root out al-Qaeda completely."

Al-Qaeda, which was responsible for the 9/11 attacks that led to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, is considerably weakened but still maintains a presence in the country. Estimates of its membership range from several dozen to 500.

"Al-Qaeda is a shadow of its former self, but it's still a threat," said Nathan Sales, a former senior counterterrorism official. "We need to remain vigilant and ensure that they don't regain their strength."

ISIS-K, which started operations in Afghanistan in 2015, is a distinct group from the Taliban and al-Qaeda. It has carried out numerous attacks on civilians and has ambitions of territory control.

"ISIS-K is a resilient group within Afghanistan, but it's unlikely to plan far-reaching attacks," said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center. "However, its presence raises concerns for Afghanistan's neighbors, and it's important that we continue to monitor their activities closely."

Despite the challenges ahead, President Biden defended the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, citing the original mission to neutralize al-Qaeda post 9/11.

"We have accomplished our mission in Afghanistan," he said. "We have eliminated the threat of al-Qaeda, and we have given the Afghan people the opportunity to build a better future for themselves."

Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem echoed President Biden's sentiments, saying that the withdrawal of U.S. troops was a positive step towards peace in Afghanistan.

"We are committed to maintaining peace and stability in our country," he said. "We will work with our partners to ensure that terrorism is rooted out, and we will do everything in our power to prevent Afghanistan from being used as a base for terrorist groups."

Afghanistan analyst Abdul Sayed expressed concerns about the potential resurgence of al-Qaeda under the Taliban rule.

"While al-Qaeda is currently weakened, it's unclear what the future holds," he said. "The Taliban's relationship with al-Qaeda is complex, and there are concerns that they may allow them to regroup and regain strength."

In conclusion, the twin blasts outside Kabul's airport serve as a reminder that the terrorism threat in Afghanistan remains a pressing concern. While the Taliban has assured the international community that they will not allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for terrorist groups, doubts remain regarding their relationship with extremist factions like al-Qaeda and ISIS-K. The U.S. and its partners must continue to monitor the situation closely and work with the Taliban to ensure that terrorism is rooted out in all its forms.
