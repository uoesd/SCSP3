US Struggles to Ensure Safe Passage for Afghans Amid Taliban Blockade

The US government is facing mounting pressure to address the growing crisis in Afghanistan, where the Taliban is reportedly blocking Afghans from reaching Kabul's international airport, despite commitments made to the US. In response, the US Embassy in Kabul has alerted people that it "cannot ensure safe passage" to the airport, leaving many stranded and fearing for their lives.

Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman acknowledged the reports of the Taliban blocking Afghans from the airport, stating that the US is "engaging with the Taliban to ensure safe passage for Americans, third-country nationals, and Afghans." However, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin revealed that the US military cannot safely escort Americans in Kabul to the airport for evacuation, highlighting the challenges faced by the US in ensuring the safety of those seeking to flee the country.

Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mitt Romney have urged the US to not forget Afghan journalists and support staff seeking evacuation, emphasizing the need for the US to protect those who have supported its efforts in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the US military has deployed 4,500 troops to Hamid Karzai International Airport to facilitate the evacuation, with over 4,840 people processed for evacuation in the past few days.

Despite the ongoing efforts, the Biden administration faces criticism over its handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Sherman assured that "this is an all-hands-on-deck effort, and we aren't going to let up," but the situation remains dire, with many Afghans fearing for their lives as the Taliban continues to block their path to safety. The US must continue to work closely with the Taliban to ensure safe passage for all those seeking to flee the country, and to protect those who have supported its efforts in Afghanistan.
