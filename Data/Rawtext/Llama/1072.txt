Gabby Petito's Hometown Mourns Her Loss with Blue Ribbons and a Special Ceremony

The small town of Blue Point, Long Island is mourning the loss of one of its own, Gabby Petito, who was found dead in a Wyoming park after a trip with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie. The community is paying tribute to Petito's memory in various ways, including placing blue ribbons around town and planning a special ceremony.

Jennifer McNamara, organizer of the Johnny Mac Foundation, a non-profit organization created in honor of FDNY firefighter John McNamara, a 9/11 first responder, said, "We wanted to do something to honor Gabby's memory and support her family during this difficult time." The foundation has organized a teal blue ribbon tribute, matching the color of Petito's eyes, which adorns local trees in Blue Point.

Nichole Schmidt, Petito's mother, has close ties to the Johnny Mac Foundation and expressed her gratitude for the tribute. "It's a beautiful gesture and a reminder that Gabby will never be forgotten," she said.

A billboard in memory of Gabby has been erected near her family home, featuring a photo of her and the words "In Loving Memory of Gabby Petito." The billboard was donated by a local business owner who wished to remain anonymous.

In addition to the ribbon tribute and billboard, a "Shine a Light for Gabby" candle lighting ceremony is planned for Friday night. The event aims to be intimate, with no mass gathering encouraged. "We want to create a peaceful and respectful atmosphere for Gabby's family and friends to remember her by," said McNamara.

The community's outpouring of support for Petito's family has been overwhelming. "It's a testament to the kindness and compassion of the people in Blue Point," said Schmidt. "Gabby will always be in our hearts and memories."

Petito's death has left a void in the community, but the tributes and ceremonies planned in her honor serve as a reminder of the impact she had on those who knew her. "Gabby was a shining light, and we will continue to celebrate her life and memory," said McNamara.

The investigation into Petito's death is ongoing, with the FBI and local authorities working together to gather evidence and piece together the events surrounding her death.

As the community of Blue Point continues to mourn the loss of Gabby Petito, they take comfort in the knowledge that her memory will live on through the tributes and ceremonies planned in her honor. "Gabby will never be forgotten," said Schmidt. "She will always be with us in spirit and in our hearts."

The "Shine a Light for Gabby" candle lighting ceremony will take place on Friday night at 7:00 PM at the Blue Point Community Park. The public is invited to attend, but organizers ask that attendees refrain from gathering in large groups out of respect for Petito's family and friends.
