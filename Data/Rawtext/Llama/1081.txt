Gabby Petito's Stepfather Criticizes Brian Laundrie's Silence as 'Unacceptable'

The stepfather of missing woman Gabby Petito has spoken out against Brian Laundrie, the man she was traveling with when she disappeared, and his family's silence, calling it "unacceptable."

"I think it's unacceptable that Brian and his family have not said anything," James Schmidt, Petito's stepfather, told Insider. "They need to step up and do the right thing. They need to provide information to the police and help find Gabby."

Petito, 22, has been missing since she and Laundrie were traveling in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park. She was reported missing on September 11, 10 days after Laundrie returned home alone to Florida.

Laundrie has only communicated through a lawyer and has not provided information to the police. Petito's family has urged the Laundrie family to come forward with any information they may have.

"We implore the Laundrie family to cooperate with the investigation and provide any information they may have," Schmidt said. "It's time for them to do the right thing and help us find Gabby."

Police have named Laundrie as a person of interest in Petito's disappearance. An incident involving the couple on August 12 was deemed a "mental health crisis" by police.

Schmidt has been actively involved in the search efforts in Wyoming and has urged those who were in the same areas as Petito to review their photos for potential leads.

"We are still hopeful that Gabby will be found safe and sound," Schmidt said. "We need everyone's help to make that happen. We urge anyone who may have seen Gabby or Brian to come forward and share that information with the police."

Petito and Laundrie documented their trip on social media until around the end of August. The couple's last known location was in Grand Teton National Park, where they were seen leaving a campground on August 27.

"We are grateful for the efforts of the police and the search teams who have been working tirelessly to find Gabby," Schmidt said. "We will continue to do everything we can to help find her and bring her home safely."

The search for Petito has been ongoing since her disappearance was reported. Authorities have searched the area where the couple was last seen, but so far, no signs of Petito have been found.

"We understand that Brian has lawyered up, but that doesn't mean he can't provide information to the police," Schmidt said. "It's time for him to do the right thing and help us find Gabby."

The case has garnered national attention, with many people sharing information and photos of Petito on social media in an effort to help find her.

"We are grateful for the outpouring of support from the public," Schmidt said. "We will continue to do everything we can to find Gabby and bring her home safely."

As the search for Petito continues, her family and the police are urging anyone with information to come forward.

"We urge anyone who may have seen Gabby or Brian to come forward and share that information with the police," Schmidt said. "We need everyone's help to find Gabby and bring her home safely."

The investigation into Petito's disappearance is ongoing, and the police are working tirelessly to find her.

"We will continue to do everything we can to find Gabby and bring her home safely," Schmidt said. "We implore the Laundrie family to cooperate with the investigation and provide any information they may have. It's time for them to do the right thing."
