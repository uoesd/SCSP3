WHO Grants Emergency Use Listing to Two AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 Vaccines

The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, a significant step towards ensuring equitable access to vaccines globally. The vaccines are produced by AstraZeneca-SKBio (Republic of Korea) and the Serum Institute of India.

Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products, emphasized the importance of equitable vaccine distribution. "The Emergency Use Listing (EUL) process is crucial for COVAX Facility vaccine supply and allows countries to expedite regulatory approval, ensuring that vaccines are available to those who need them most," she said.

The EUL process requires vaccine developers to submit full data for a rapid assessment by WHO. The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines' EUL process took under four weeks after assessment of various data and manufacturing site inspections.

SAGE, the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, recommends the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine for everyone aged 18 and above. The vaccine, ChAdOx1-S, has been found to have a 63.09% efficacy and is suitable for low- and middle-income countries.

The EUL procedure aims to make health products available rapidly during emergencies while ensuring safety, efficacy, and quality. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was also listed by WHO for emergency use on 31 December 2020.

The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine's EUL listing is a significant milestone in the fight against COVID-19, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where access to vaccines has been a challenge. "This is a vital step towards ensuring that people everywhere have access to life-saving vaccines," said Dr Simão.

The WHO's EUL process has been instrumental in expediting the availability of COVID-19 vaccines globally. With the addition of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines, the COVAX Facility can now supply vaccines to more countries, helping to slow the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable populations.

In conclusion, the WHO's listing of two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use is a significant step towards ensuring equitable access to vaccines globally. The EUL process has been crucial in expediting the availability of vaccines, and the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine's efficacy and suitability for low- and middle-income countries make it an important tool in the fight against COVID-19.
