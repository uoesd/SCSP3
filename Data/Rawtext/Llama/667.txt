Kyle Rittenhouse Expresses Regret Over Kenosha Trip, Defends Actions as Self-Defense

In a recent episode of the podcast "You Are Here" hosted by BlazeTV, Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old who was acquitted of all charges related to the shooting deaths of two men and the wounding of another during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, expressed regret over his decision to go to the city.

"Looking back, it might not have been the best idea," Rittenhouse said. Despite his regrets, he maintained that he acted in self-defense during the events in Kenosha.

Rittenhouse's defense team argued that the shootings were justified as he aimed to provide medical care and protect businesses. Prosecutors, on the other hand, contended that Rittenhouse escalated the situation by arming himself with an AR-15 style weapon.

During the podcast, co-host Sydney Watson made controversial remarks about the shootings, which Rittenhouse did not celebrate. "I don't think it's something to be celebrated. It's a tragedy that people lost their lives," Rittenhouse said.

The families of the victims have expressed their dismay at the verdict, highlighting a lack of accountability. Rittenhouse, however, maintains that he was simply defending himself. "I didn't go there to be a hero. I went there to defend myself," he said.

Rittenhouse also revealed that he has been struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) since the incident. "It's been tough. I've been dealing with a lot of PTSD," he said. Despite this, he tries to cope through humor, discussing trial memes and joking about his newfound fame.

When asked if he considered himself a hero, Rittenhouse was quick to dismiss the idea. "No, I don't think I'm a hero. I just did what I had to do to protect myself," he said.

The events in Kenosha have sparked a national debate about gun rights, self-defense, and the role of armed civilians in protests. Rittenhouse's acquittal has been met with both relief and outrage, highlighting the deep divisions in American society.

As the dust settles on this controversial case, it remains to be seen how Rittenhouse's actions will be remembered. Will he be remembered as a hero or a villain? Only time will tell.

In conclusion, Kyle Rittenhouse's recent appearance on "You Are Here" has shed new light on his actions during the Kenosha protests. While he expressed regret over his decision to go to the city, he maintains that he acted in self-defense and does not consider himself a hero. The events in Kenosha continue to be a topic of heated debate, with no clear resolution in sight.
