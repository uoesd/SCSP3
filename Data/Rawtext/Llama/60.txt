Capitol Riot Fallout: FBI Warned of Violence, Officials Mull Sedition Charges and No-Fly List

WASHINGTON (AP) – The FBI warned of potential extremist-driven violence ahead of the Capitol riot, and officials are now considering sedition charges against some rioters, with possible 20-year prison terms. The Justice Department has formed a strike force to investigate the riot, similar to counterterrorism probes. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for rioters to be placed on a no-fly list.

According to acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin, the Justice Department is considering charges of sedition and conspiracy against those who participated in the violent siege of the Capitol building on January 6. "We're looking at significant felony cases," Sherwin said. "These are cases that carry a 20-year sentence."

The FBI had warned law enforcement agencies of potential violence in a January 5 report, which detailed the potential for "war" in Washington. However, Capitol Police and other officials have said they were unaware of the serious concerns about January 6. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy reportedly wasn't notified about the FBI warning, and officials turned down Pentagon help three days before the riot. Response teams were delayed during the assault, which resulted in at least five deaths, including one Capitol Police officer, and disrupted the peaceful transfer of power.

"The FBI shared information with law enforcement agencies, including the Capitol Police, about the potential for violence on January 6," said Steven D'Antuono, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington field office. "We take all threats of violence seriously and take appropriate action to ensure the safety of the public."

Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said the Justice Department is committed to holding those responsible for the violence accountable. "We will spare no resource in identifying and prosecuting those who engaged in criminal activity," Rosen said.

The riot, which was sparked by supporters of President Donald Trump who were protesting the election results, has raised questions about the preparedness of law enforcement agencies and the response to the violence. Early statements suggested that law enforcement was unprepared for the level of violence, but officials have since pushed back on those claims.

The investigation into the riot is ongoing, with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies working to identify and arrest those who participated in the violence. The strike force formed by the Justice Department is similar to those used in counterterrorism investigations and will focus on identifying and prosecuting those who engaged in the most serious crimes.

In addition to the criminal investigation, there are also calls for increased security measures to prevent future violence. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for rioters to be placed on a no-fly list, and there are concerns about the potential for further violence in the coming days and weeks.

The Capitol riot has shaken the nation and raised questions about the fragility of democratic institutions. As the investigation continues and the full extent of the violence becomes clear, it is clear that the fallout from this event will be felt for a long time to come.
