"Rust" Armorer Mentored by Gun Expert, Denies Expecting Live Rounds on Set

In the wake of the tragic accident on the set of the movie "Rust," questions are being raised about the safety protocols in place and the role of the armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed. It has been revealed that Gutierrez-Reed was mentored by gun expert Seth Kenney, who owned a weapon and prop rental company and was hired as an "armorer mentor" for Gutierrez-Reed.

Kenney supplied the firearms and most of the ammunition for the "Rust" set, including the Colt .45 used by Alec Baldwin when cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was accidentally shot and killed. According to Jason Bowles, attorney for Gutierrez-Reed, she was extremely safety conscious and did not expect live rounds on set.

"Hannah is devastated by this accident, and she's cooperating fully with the investigation," Bowles said. "She's a safety-conscious person, and she would never expect live rounds to be on set."

Gutierrez-Reed claims to have checked the rounds to ensure they were "dummies" and locked up the guns, including on the day of the shooting. However, Santa Fe County Sheriff's spokesperson Juan Ríos could not confirm the Los Angeles Times's reporting that live ammunition was found on set.

"We're still investigating, and we can't confirm anything at this point," Ríos said.

No live ammunition was supposedly kept on the "Rust" set, according to Gutierrez-Reed. However, Sheriff Adan Mendoza stated that finding a live round on set contradicts Gutierrez-Reed's claim of no live rounds being present.

"We have recovered a live round from the scene, which contradicts the armorer's statement that there were no live rounds on set," Mendoza said.

Filming on "Rust" has been halted, and an investigation into the incident is ongoing, with no charges filed yet. The incident has raised concerns about safety protocols on movie sets and the responsibility of armorers to ensure the safety of cast and crew.

"This is a tragic reminder of the importance of safety on set," Bowles said. "We need to make sure that all necessary precautions are taken to prevent accidents like this from happening in the future."

As the investigation continues, questions remain about the role of Gutierrez-Reed and the safety protocols in place on the "Rust" set. While Gutierrez-Reed maintains that she was safety-conscious and did not expect live rounds on set, the discovery of a live round on set raises concerns about the effectiveness of safety protocols and the responsibility of armorers to ensure the safety of all involved.

"We're going to get to the bottom of this and find out what happened," Mendoza said. "We owe it to the victim and her family to make sure that something like this never happens again."
