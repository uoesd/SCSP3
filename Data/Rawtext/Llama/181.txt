Intermountain Healthcare to Require All Caregivers to be Fully Vaccinated Against COVID-19

Salt Lake City, UT - Intermountain Healthcare, one of the largest healthcare providers in Utah, has announced that it will require all of its caregivers to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. This move comes in response to pending federal rules that will only allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover services from healthcare providers with fully vaccinated employees.

According to Dr. Mark Briesacher, chief physician executive at Intermountain Healthcare, this step is necessary to continue caring for patients with federal health insurance. "We have a responsibility to protect our patients, and this is the best way to do that," he said in a statement.

Intermountain Healthcare has already made significant progress in vaccinating its employees, with approximately 80% of its care providers already fully vaccinated. However, the remaining 20% will need to get vaccinated or face administrative leave starting on January 5, and potential separation from the organization by February 9.

Employees may seek exemptions from the vaccine mandate for medical or religious reasons, similar to other vaccination requirements. However, it's unclear how many employees may choose to quit or be fired rather than comply with the vaccine mandate.

Intermountain Healthcare is not the first healthcare provider in Utah to require employee vaccinations. University of Utah Health has already implemented a similar policy, and other healthcare providers in the state are expected to follow suit.

The move by Intermountain Healthcare comes in response to federal vaccination requirements announced by President Joe Biden in September, which affect healthcare providers and large employers. The requirements are aimed at protecting patients and employees from the spread of COVID-19.

Utah Speaker Brad Wilson expressed his support for the vaccine mandate, stating that it is necessary to protect public health. "We have a responsibility to ensure that our healthcare providers are taking the necessary steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19," he said.

Despite some opposition to the vaccine mandate, it is unlikely that the Utah Legislature will be able to intervene. Intermountain Healthcare receives federal funding, which means that the organization is subject to federal regulations.

The vaccine mandate has been a controversial issue, with some arguing that it infringes on personal freedom. However, healthcare experts argue that vaccination is essential to protecting public health and preventing the spread of COVID-19.

In a statement, Intermountain Healthcare emphasized its commitment to patient safety and the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of COVID-19. "We take our responsibility to protect our patients very seriously, and this step is necessary to ensure their safety," the statement read.

The vaccine mandate will apply to all Intermountain Healthcare employees, including nurses, doctors, and support staff. The organization has already begun implementing the policy, and employees have been notified of the requirements.

While some employees may choose to leave their jobs rather than get vaccinated, healthcare experts argue that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh any potential risks. "Vaccination is the best way to protect ourselves and our patients from COVID-19," said Dr. Briesacher.

In conclusion, Intermountain Healthcare's decision to require all caregivers to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 is a necessary step to protect patients and employees. The move is in response to pending federal rules and is consistent with other healthcare providers in the state. While some may oppose the vaccine mandate, healthcare experts argue that it is essential to preventing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting public health.
