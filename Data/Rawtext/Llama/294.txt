WHO Emergency Committee Reiterates Call for Sustained Efforts to Control COVID-19 Pandemic

The World Health Organization (WHO) held the ninth meeting of its Emergency Committee on COVID-19 on 22 October 2021. The Committee, chaired by Professor Didier Houssin, focused on the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and emphasized a risk-based vaccination approach.

In his opening remarks, Professor Houssin emphasized that "the pandemic is far from over, and we must continue to use all available tools to control it." He highlighted the importance of maintaining public health and social measures (PHSM) alongside vaccinations, as well as the need for continued research into various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and pandemic response.

Committee members were briefed on ethics and conflict of interest, and global epidemiological updates and vaccine equity issues were discussed. Concerns were raised about the African Region's access to vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics, and the importance of addressing these disparities was underscored.

The Committee also identified research needs on various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and pandemic response, including the effectiveness of different vaccines, the impact of PHSM on transmission, and the long-term effects of the virus.

Despite progress in some areas, the pandemic still constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and the Director-General agreed with the Committee's advice and issued Temporary Recommendations to States Parties.

In conclusion, the WHO Emergency Committee on COVID-19 reiterated the need for sustained efforts to control the pandemic, emphasizing a multi-faceted approach that includes vaccination, PHSM, and research. As Professor Houssin noted, "We must continue to work together to address the ongoing challenges of this pandemic and protect the health and well-being of all people."
