Newsom Proposes Expanded Golden State Stimulus, Largest State Tax Rebate in U.S. History

Governor Gavin Newsom unveiled a plan to expand the Golden State Stimulus, proposing $600 checks for Californians earning up to $75,000, as part of a $100 billion California comeback initiative. The plan also includes paying down back rent for tenants and assisting millions in catching up on utility bills due to the COVID-19 impact.

"We're not just talking about recovery, we're talking about a comeback," Newsom said during a news conference. "We're talking about a comeback that's inclusive, equitable, and sustainable."

The proposal is made possible by a $75.7 billion state surplus, which allows Newsom to propose the largest state tax rebate in U.S. history. The expanded Golden State Stimulus would provide $11.9 billion for $600 payments, $5.2 billion for rent relief, $2 billion for utility bills, and $1 billion in college grants.

Senator Nancy Skinner (D-Oakland), the Senate budget committee lead, praised the plan, saying, "This is a bold and visionary plan that recognizes the economic disparity caused by the pandemic, particularly among low-wage workers and people of color."

Phil Ting (D-San Francisco), the Assembly counterpart, echoed Skinner's sentiments, stating, "This plan is a game-changer for millions of Californians who have been struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic."

However, not everyone is convinced. Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox criticized the plan as politically motivated, saying, "Gavin Newsom is trying to buy his way out of a recall election with taxpayer money."

Kevin Faulconer, a former San Diego mayor and Republican gubernatorial candidate, also criticized the plan, stating, "This is a desperate attempt by Gavin Newsom to distract from his failed leadership and the reality that California is struggling under his watch."

Despite the criticism, advocates push for greater relief for undocumented immigrants, who have been largely excluded from federal relief. Anna Hasselblad, public policy director for United Ways of California, said, "We need to make sure that all Californians, regardless of their immigration status, have access to the resources they need to recover from the pandemic."

The state's eviction moratorium is set to expire on June 30, making the rent relief proposal urgent. Newsom emphasized the need to act quickly, saying, "We can't afford to wait. We need to take action now to support Californians who are struggling."

Under Newsom's plan, 78% of California tax filers would receive a stimulus payment. The plan aims to address the economic disparity caused by the pandemic, especially among low-wage workers and people of color.

The proposal will be discussed in the state legislature in the coming weeks, with a vote expected in June. If approved, the stimulus payments would be sent out in August, providing much-needed relief to millions of Californians.

In conclusion, Governor Newsom's proposal to expand the Golden State Stimulus is a bold move to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in California. While criticized by some as politically motivated, the plan has received widespread support from lawmakers and advocates who recognize the need to support struggling Californians. As the state moves forward with its recovery efforts, the expanded Golden State Stimulus could provide a much-needed lifeline for millions of residents.
