DeSantis Proposes $100,000 Daily Fine for Social Media Companies That Block Politicians

TALLAHASSEE – Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a proposal on Tuesday to penalize social media companies for blocking politicians, proposing a $100,000 daily fine for de-platforming candidates in Florida. The move is seen as a response to the banning of former President Trump from major platforms and aims to protect politicians' speech on social media, even if they incite violence.

"We want to make sure that these social media companies are held accountable for their actions," DeSantis said at a news conference. "They're not the arbiters of truth. They're not the ones who get to decide who can speak and who can't speak."

The proposal, which will be introduced in the upcoming legislative session, would require social media companies to give a 30-day notice before suspending accounts and to explain the reasons for suspensions. It would also classify promotional content for candidates as political contributions and mandate transparency in how content is prioritized or suppressed.

Trump's lawyers, David Schoen and Bruce Castor, argued that his speech before the Capitol riot was protected under the First Amendment, disputing claims that he incited violence. "The First Amendment protects speech that some people might find offensive or inflammatory," Schoen said.

DeSantis criticized social media companies for what he perceives as bias against conservatives, citing the lack of action against Black Lives Matter and Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. "They're not neutral platforms," he said. "They're actively censoring certain viewpoints."

Blaise Ingoglia, R-Spring Hill, Chair of the Florida House Commerce Committee, echoed DeSantis' concerns. "Social media companies have too much power over our political discourse," he said. "It's time for us to take a closer look at how they operate and ensure that they're not silencing certain voices."

Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, a Democrat, suggested that the focus should be on reducing Big Tech's monopoly power at the federal level, rather than Florida attempting to regulate private companies. "We need to address the root issue of these companies' dominance in our society," she said.

Senate President Wilton Simpson, R-Trilby, emphasized the need for congressional action, stating that Florida has limited power to intervene with Big Tech. "This is a national issue that requires a national solution," he said.

DeSantis avoided directly answering whether he believes the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, instead comparing the situation to claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election. "I think there are a lot of questions that need to be answered," he said.

The proposed legislation has sparked debate, with some arguing that it infringes on the First Amendment rights of social media companies. Others see it as a necessary step to ensure that politicians are held accountable for their actions on social media.

In conclusion, DeSantis' proposal to penalize social media companies for blocking politicians is a controversial move that has sparked debate and discussion. While the proposal aims to protect politicians' speech on social media, it also raises questions about the role of government in regulating private companies. As the issue continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how Florida lawmakers will address the issue and whether other states will follow suit.
