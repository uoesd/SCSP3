Norm Macdonald, Comedy Genius and 'SNL' Legend, Dies at 61

Norm Macdonald, the legendary comedian and actor known for his iconic roles on "Saturday Night Live" and "Weekend Update," has passed away at the age of 61 after a private nine-year battle with cancer. Macdonald's producing partner, Lori Jo Hoekstra, confirmed the news, stating that he died peacefully on Tuesday morning.

Born in Quebec City, Canada, Macdonald began his career writing for "Roseanne" before joining the cast of "SNL" in 1993. He quickly became known for his unique comedic voice and his ability to tackle serious subjects with humor. Macdonald's time as the host of "Weekend Update" was particularly memorable, with his O.J. Simpson jokes becoming a highlight of his tenure.

However, Macdonald's time on "Weekend Update" was cut short in 1998, when he was removed from the desk. Macdonald attributed this decision to NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer's disapproval of his O.J. Simpson jokes. Despite this setback, Macdonald continued to thrive in the comedy world, starring in "The Norm Show," having a recurring role on "The Middle," and appearing on late-night shows, notably with David Letterman and Conan O'Brien.

Macdonald's humor often tackled serious subjects like cancer, reflecting his perspective on life and death. His ability to find humor in the darkest of times was a testament to his unflinching integrity and humor. "SNL" issued a statement mourning the loss of Macdonald, highlighting his unparalleled talent and the impact he had on the show.

Tributes poured in from celebrities across the entertainment industry, all emphasizing Macdonald's unparalleled talent in comedy. David Letterman, who had a long history of collaborating with Macdonald, described him as a "comedy genius." Conan O'Brien, who also had a close relationship with Macdonald, echoed this sentiment, stating that he was "one of the funniest people [he'd] ever met." Seth Rogen, who worked with Macdonald on several projects, praised his ability to make people laugh, even in the darkest of times.

Other celebrities, such as Jon Stewart, Edgar Wright, Steve Martin, Jim Carrey, Jim Gaffigan, and Patton Oswalt, also paid tribute to Macdonald's legacy, highlighting his impact on the comedy world and his unparalleled talent.

Macdonald leaves behind an adult son, Dylan Macdonald, and a legacy that will be remembered for generations to come. His death is a loss to the comedy and entertainment world, but his humor and legacy will continue to live on.

In a statement, Macdonald's family expressed their gratitude for the outpouring of support and asked for privacy during this difficult time.

Macdonald's passing is a reminder of the impact that comedy can have on our lives. His ability to make us laugh, even in the darkest of times, is a testament to his talent and his legacy.
