Stuck in the Suez: Companies Face Protracted Legal Battle to Recover Goods Worth Millions

London CNN Business – The Ever Given, a Japanese-owned container ship that has been impounded in the Suez Canal since March, holds goods worth millions of dollars for companies like IKEA and Lenovo. However, a protracted legal battle over a $916 million compensation claim by the Suez Canal Authority against the ship's owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha, has left companies that have goods stuck on the ship in limbo.

The Ever Given was carrying goods worth between $600 million to $700 million when it was impounded, affecting both large corporations and small businesses. However, the companies that have goods stuck on the ship have been excluded from negotiations between the Suez Canal Authority and Shoei Kisen Kaisha, and may have to pay a portion of the settlement under the "general average" maritime law principle.

"It's a nightmare scenario for us," said Will Pearson, Director of Pearson 1860, a UK-based bicycle manufacturer that has goods stuck on the Ever Given. "We're facing significant financial implications, and we're not even sure when we'll be able to recover our products."

Jai Sharma, Head of Cargo Casualty at Clyde & Co., a law firm that specializes in maritime cases, explained that the "general average" principle means that all parties involved in the shipment, including the cargo owners, are liable to contribute to the costs incurred during the incident. "It's a complex and time-consuming process, and it's not uncommon for disputes to arise between the different parties involved," he said.

Michael Shah, CEO of EasyEquipment, a commercial refrigerator supplier that has goods stuck on the Ever Given, expressed frustration at the lack of communication from the Suez Canal Authority and Shoei Kisen Kaisha. "We've been left in the dark regarding the status of our goods and the legal negotiations. It's causing major cash flow issues for our business, especially since we don't have marine insurance," he said.

IKEA and Lenovo have confirmed that they have products on the impounded ship, but they have not provided specific details. Jack Griffiths, Co-founder of Snuggy UK, a small business that has goods stuck on the Ever Given, said that the situation is causing significant financial strain for his company. "We're a small business, and we can't afford to lose the money that's tied up in the goods that are stuck on the ship," he said.

The Suez Canal Authority and Shoei Kisen Kaisha have not commented on the situation, leaving companies that have goods stuck on the Ever Given in a state of uncertainty. "It's a difficult situation for all parties involved," said Sharma. "But ultimately, the goal is to find a solution that works for everyone, and that allows the goods to be released as soon as possible."

For now, companies that have goods stuck on the Ever Given can only wait and hope for a resolution to the legal battle. "It's a frustrating and stressful situation, but we're trying to stay positive and hope that a solution will be found soon," said Pearson.

The situation highlights the potential risks and complexities involved in global trade, and the importance of having adequate insurance and contingency plans in place. "It's a reminder that things can go wrong, even with the best planning and preparation," said Shah. "We're just hoping that our goods will be released soon, and that we can get back to business as usual."
