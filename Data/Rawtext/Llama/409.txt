Prosecutors Adjust Duration of Chauvin's Knee on Floyd's Neck to Nine Minutes

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – Prosecutors in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin have adjusted the duration of time he had his knee on George Floyd's neck, citing new evidence from police body-camera video. The revised timing, revealed in recent filings, indicates that Chauvin's restraint lasted at least nine minutes, and possibly up to 9 minutes, 31 seconds.

The initial time recorded was 8 minutes, 46 seconds, but was later corrected to 7:46 due to a math error. However, the discrepancies in the timing are not expected to impact Chauvin's trial, according to a former prosecutor and a support group for victims of police violence.

"The one-minute error is not significant in the grand scheme of things," said Toshira Garraway, founder of Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence. "What's important is that we have a fair and impartial trial, and that justice is served for George Floyd and his family."

Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter for Floyd's death, which occurred on May 25, 2020, during a police arrest. Three other officers are also charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter, and are scheduled for trial in August.

The 8:46 timing became symbolic, prompting demonstrations and acts of remembrance lasting 8 minutes, 46 seconds. However, prosecutors acknowledged the error and stated that it would not affect the case.

The revised timing from prosecutors indicates that Chauvin's restraint lasted at least nine minutes but possibly up to 9 minutes, 31 seconds. The exact duration of the restraint is anticipated to be a significant part of the trial, relating to Floyd's cause of death and Chauvin's state of mind.

"The length of time that Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck is crucial to understanding the severity of the violence used against him," said Garraway. "We need to know exactly how long Floyd was suffering, and how long Chauvin continued to restrain him, in order to hold him accountable for his actions."

The adjusted timing is not expected to impact the charges against Chauvin or the other officers, but it may affect the testimony of witnesses and the presentation of evidence during the trial.

"The important thing is that we get the facts right and that justice is served," said a spokesperson for the prosecutor's office. "We will continue to review the evidence and make any necessary adjustments as we prepare for trial."

The trial of Derek Chauvin is scheduled to begin on June 28, and is expected to last several weeks. The case has attracted national attention and has sparked ongoing protests and calls for police reform.

In the meantime, the community continues to remember George Floyd and the impact of his death on their lives.

"George Floyd's death has left a deep scar on our community, and we will never forget the injustice that was done to him," said Garraway. "We will continue to fight for justice and for a world where everyone is treated with dignity and respect."
