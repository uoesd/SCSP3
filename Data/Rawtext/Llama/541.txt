Biden Honors Fallen Troops as Afghanistan Withdrawal Criticism Mounts

President Joe Biden paid his respects to the 13 US service members killed in the Kabul airport attack during a dignified transfer ceremony at Dover Air Force Base on Sunday. The ceremony took place amid mounting criticism of Biden's handling of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Biden and First Lady Jill Biden attended the ceremony, where the president called the fallen soldiers "heroes" in a speech. He also expressed the personal pain of loss, recalling his late son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015.

"These heroes gave their last breath for their country, and we owe them our deepest gratitude," Biden said. "We will never forget their sacrifice, and we will always honor their memory."

The ceremony was also attended by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, among other dignitaries.

The Kabul airport attack, which killed more than 100 Afghans, is blamed on a regional arm of the Islamic State. In response, the US launched drone strikes on Islamic State targets.

Biden faces criticism over the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, with approximately 250 US nationals remaining in Afghanistan. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan assured those remaining they "are not going to be stuck in Afghanistan."

However, critics, including Senator Ben Sasse and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, lambasted Biden's withdrawal strategy.

"The President's decision to withdraw all US troops from Afghanistan is a grave mistake," Sasse said in a statement. "It's a slap in the face to our allies and a gift to our enemies."

McConnell echoed Sasse's sentiments, saying, "The President's decision to retreat from Afghanistan is a strategic mistake that will have far-reaching consequences."

Despite the criticism, Biden remains committed to his decision to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan.

"I know that this decision has been controversial, but I am convinced that it is the right one for our country and for our troops," Biden said. "We have been in Afghanistan for 20 years, and it is time for us to bring our troops home."

The withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan is set to be completed by the end of August.

In conclusion, the dignified transfer ceremony at Dover Air Force Base served as a somber reminder of the sacrifices made by US service members in Afghanistan. As the US continues to withdraw its troops from the country, the criticism of Biden's handling of the exit remains a contentious issue.
