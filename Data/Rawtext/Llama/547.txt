Four California Service Members Killed in Kabul Airport Bombing

The recent bombing at Kabul airport in Afghanistan has left four California service members dead, along with 13 other U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. The suicide bombing occurred during the evacuation process amid the Taliban takeover, marking one of the deadliest days in the Afghan war.

The California victims have been identified as Sgt. Nicole Gee, Lance Cpl. Dylan Merola, Cpl. Hunter Lopez, and Lance Cpl. Kareem Mae'Lee Grant Nikoui.

Sgt. Nicole Gee, a maintenance technician, posted a photo on Instagram a week before her death, expressing her love for her job. "I love my job. I love my team. I love my aircraft," she captioned the photo.

Lance Cpl. Kareem Nikoui, a graduate from Norco High School, will be honored on the 'Lest We Forget Wall' at the George A. Ingalls Veterans Memorial Plaza.

Cpl. Hunter Lopez was the son of Riverside Deputy Sheriff Alicia Lopez and Riverside Sheriff's Captain Herman Lopez. He planned to become a Riverside County Sheriff's Deputy.
