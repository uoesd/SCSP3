Leading the Charge: Vice President Harris on the Biden-Harris Administration's Commitment to Safe Water and Good Jobs

As Vice President of the United States, I stand before you today to reaffirm the Biden-Harris administration's commitment to ensuring safe water and creating good jobs for all Americans. We recognize the critical role that leadership and accountability play in addressing the issues of lead pipes and paint, and we are dedicated to working with communities across the country to tackle these challenges head-on.

The American labor movement has been a driving force for progress and prosperity, and our administration is proud to stand in solidarity with workers and their families. We believe in being pro-labor, and we are committed to creating jobs that are not only good for the economy but also good for workers and their communities.

The dangers of lead exposure, particularly for children, are alarming and unacceptable. Lead pipes and paint pose a widespread threat to public health, and it is our responsibility to act with urgency and determination to address this issue. That is why the Biden-Harris administration has launched the Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan, which aims to accelerate the removal of lead pipes and paint over the next 10 years, with a focus on underserved communities.

Our administration is committed to working with Congress to secure the necessary funding to support this effort. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which was supported by leaders from both parties, allocates $15 billion for replacing lead service lines nationwide. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is set to distribute $2.9 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2022 for lead service line replacement in states, tribes, and territories.

Furthermore, funds from the American Rescue Plan can also be used for lead service line replacement, as exemplified by projects in Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Syracuse, and Duluth. These investments will not only improve public health but also create jobs, including good union jobs.

As I recently saw firsthand during my visit to Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 189 in Columbus, Ohio, the enthusiasm and skill development for the expected job opportunities are palpable. Replacing lead service lines and upgrading water infrastructure will require skilled labor, and we are committed to providing the necessary training and support to ensure that workers are equipped to succeed in these good-paying jobs.

In conclusion, the Biden-Harris administration is committed to ensuring that every American has access to safe and clean drinking water. We recognize the critical role that leadership and accountability play in addressing the issues of lead pipes and paint, and we are dedicated to working with communities across the country to tackle these challenges head-on. By creating good jobs and investing in our nation's infrastructure, we can build a better future for all Americans. Thank you.
