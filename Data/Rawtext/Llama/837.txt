Tiger Woods' Car Crash Investigation: Sheriff's Department Obtains Search Warrant for Black Box

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has obtained a search warrant for the black box of Tiger Woods' car, which crashed last week in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The move is part of the department's routine investigation into the accident, but it does not necessarily indicate a criminal investigation, according to Deputy John Schloegl.

The black box, also known as an event data recorder, contains information about the vehicle's performance and movements before, during, and after the crash. It can provide details on the car's speed, steering, brake, and acceleration, which could help investigators piece together what happened in the moments leading up to the accident.

Schloegl emphasized that the warrant for the black box requires probable cause that a crime was committed. However, he stressed that the investigation is still in its early stages, and the sheriff's department has not concluded the cause of the crash.

In 2017, Woods was found asleep at the wheel with various medications in his system. While no evidence of impairment was observed in Woods immediately after the crash, accident reconstruction experts suggest that he may not have been paying attention, possibly asleep at the wheel.

Jonathan Cherney, an accident reconstruction expert not involved in the investigation, said that based on the available information, it's possible that Woods may have fallen asleep or been distracted while driving. "The fact that the car crashed into a tree and there were no skid marks or signs of braking suggests that the driver may not have been paying attention," Cherney said.

Sheriff Alex Villanueva initially called the crash "purely an accident," but the department has since clarified that the investigation is ongoing. Villanueva said that the sheriff's department is working with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office to determine the cause of the crash.

Genesis, the car's manufacturer, has taken possession of the vehicle after the sheriff's department completed its examination. A spokesperson for Genesis said that the company is cooperating fully with the investigation and declined to comment further.

Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, released a statement saying that Woods is cooperating fully with the investigation and that he "looks forward to the opportunity to discuss the matter further when the time is appropriate."

The sheriff's department has not released any information about the contents of the black box, and it's unclear whether any data has been retrieved from the device. Schloegl said that the investigation is ongoing, and the sheriff's department will provide updates as new information becomes available.

In the meantime, Woods has been released from the hospital and is recovering from his injuries. The golf legend has not made any public statements about the crash or the investigation.

The accident has sparked a renewed interest in Woods' personal life and his history of substance abuse. In 2017, Woods pleaded guilty to reckless driving after he was found asleep at the wheel with various medications in his system. He was sentenced to a year of probation and completed a diversion program.

Woods' crash is a reminder of the dangers of distracted driving and the importance of staying focused on the road. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was a factor in 10% of fatal crashes in 2019.

The investigation into Woods' car crash is ongoing, and the sheriff's department has not set a timeline for when it will be completed. As more information becomes available, it's clear that this accident will have far-reaching consequences for Woods and the community.
