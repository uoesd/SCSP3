WhatsApp Outage Reveals Facebook's 'Digital Colonialism' in Global South

Monday's global outage of Facebook's messaging services, including WhatsApp, sent shockwaves across the world, but its impact was particularly severe in countries like Brazil, India, and Nigeria, where the app is not just a means of communication but an integral part of daily life. The outage highlighted the unprecedented power wielded by Facebook, and by extension WhatsApp, in the Global South, where it has become a public utility, and raised questions about the company's role in "digital colonialism."

"WhatsApp is not just a messaging app in Brazil, it's a way of life," said David Nemer, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies the impact of technology on society. "The outage showed how deeply embedded it is in people's daily routines, from personal communication to business transactions."

In Brazil, WhatsApp is used by over 90% of smartphone users, making it the most popular messaging app in the country. Its reach is so extensive that it has become a vital tool for small businesses, with many entrepreneurs relying on it for customer service, marketing, and sales. "WhatsApp is essential for my business," said Daniella Goulart, a small business owner in São Paulo. "I use it to communicate with my customers, suppliers, and employees. The outage was a nightmare for me."

The outage also exposed the vulnerability of economies in the Global South, which have come to rely heavily on WhatsApp for communication and commerce. "The outage disrupted supply chains, logistics, and financial transactions, causing significant economic losses," said Gabriel Pereira, a doctoral fellow at Aarhus University who researches the impact of technology on developing countries. "It's a reminder of how much power Facebook has over the digital lives of people in the Global South."

Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014 for $21.8 billion has led to a quadrupling of its user base, with over 2 billion people now using the app worldwide. The company's Free Basics program, which offers free access to a limited version of the internet, has also expanded its reach in the Global South. However, critics have accused Facebook of engaging in "digital colonialism" by using zero-rating to bolster a closed web and extract data from users.

WhatsApp's role in the Global South is not just limited to communication. In Brazil and India, the app now offers in-app financial transactions, further deepening its integration into daily life. The outage highlighted the cultural and economic power of WhatsApp, which other messaging options in Brazil cannot match.

The power amassed by Facebook, and by extension WhatsApp, has attracted scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators worldwide, with calls for antitrust action and public utility regulation. "Facebook's dominance in the digital landscape of the Global South is a concern," said Nemer. "It's time for regulators to take a closer look at the company's business practices and ensure that they are not abusing their power."

In conclusion, the WhatsApp outage revealed the embeddedness of Facebook's messaging services in daily digital living and the significant impact it has on economies and societies in the Global South. It also raised questions about the company's role in "digital colonialism" and the need for regulatory oversight. As Facebook continues to expand its reach and influence, it is crucial that lawmakers and regulators take a closer look at its business practices and ensure that they are not exploiting their power.
