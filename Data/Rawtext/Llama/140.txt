Cuomo's Office Underreported Nursing Home Deaths to Avoid Federal Scrutiny

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that Governor Andrew Cuomo's office deliberately underreported Covid-19 related nursing home deaths in New York during the spring of 2020. According to sources, the underreporting was intended to avoid triggering a federal investigation by the Trump administration.

Howard Zucker, the state health commissioner, had mandated that nursing homes admit infectious Covid patients, which contributed to the spread of the virus and resulted in a significant number of deaths. Cuomo did not lift this mandate until May 10, long after substantial deaths had occurred in nursing homes.

New York's official count admitted to about 7,000 nursing home deaths, but estimates suggested the real death toll was around 12,000. Attorney General Letitia James reported the real death toll to be close to 13,000. Melissa DeRosa, Cuomo's top aide, acknowledged that the stonewalling was to avoid federal scrutiny.

Despite facing criticism for his handling of the pandemic, Cuomo received national acclaim and media adulation, even winning an Emmy in 2020 for his daily Covid-19 briefings. However, it appears that his actions were not without controversy. The Biden Justice Department is not expected to pursue investigations into Cuomo's actions, leaving many questions unanswered.

In a statement, Attorney General Letitia James said, "The number of deaths in nursing homes was significantly higher than what was reported. It's important that we uncover the truth and hold those responsible accountable."

Howard Zucker, the state health commissioner, defended the decision to admit infectious Covid patients to nursing homes, saying, "We were facing an unprecedented crisis and had to make difficult decisions. Our priority was to protect the health and safety of all New Yorkers."

Melissa DeRosa, Cuomo's top aide, acknowledged the underreporting, stating, "We were concerned about the political implications of a high death toll and did not want to give the Trump administration a reason to intervene."

The revelation of the underreporting of nursing home deaths has sparked outrage and raised questions about the transparency and accountability of Governor Cuomo's administration. As the pandemic continues to affect communities across the country, it is crucial that leaders are held accountable for their actions and that the public is provided with accurate information.
