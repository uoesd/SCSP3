CNN Accused of Ignoring Cuomo Scandals, Faces Backlash for Lack of Coverage

In a shocking turn of events, CNN has been accused of ignoring sexual misconduct allegations against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and downplaying the COVID-19 testing scandal involving his brother, Chris Cuomo. The network is facing intense backlash for their lack of coverage, with many accusing them of a "blackout" on negative news against the Cuomos.

According to reports, CNN failed to report on the allegations made by Sherry Vill, the ninth accuser to come forward against Governor Cuomo. Vill alleges that Cuomo groped her inappropriately during a visit to her home in 2017. Despite the serious nature of the allegations, CNN did not cover the story, leading many to question their commitment to reporting on sexual misconduct.

Furthermore, CNN did not report on the VIP COVID-19 testing given to Chris Cuomo and his family for almost a week. When Chris Cuomo returned to his primetime show, he failed to address the scandal, sparking criticism from many in the media. CNN's defense of Chris Cuomo's actions during the pandemic has also attracted criticism, with many accusing the network of prioritizing the Cuomos over the truth.

A CNN spokesperson's defense of Chris Cuomo's actions during the pandemic sparked outrage, with many accusing the network of being complicit in covering up the scandal. Fox News was quick to criticize CNN's lack of coverage on these scandals, highlighting the double standard in their reporting.

The lack of coverage by CNN has led many to question their commitment to holding those in power accountable. The network's failure to report on the allegations against Governor Cuomo and the testing scandal involving Chris Cuomo has sparked accusations of a "blackout" on negative news against the Cuomos.

In a time when the media is under intense scrutiny, CNN's lack of coverage on these scandals is a glaring omission. The public relies on the media to hold those in power accountable and to report on issues of public interest. By ignoring these scandals, CNN is failing in their duty to inform the public and hold those in power accountable.

As the scandals surrounding the Cuomos continue to unfold, CNN's lack of coverage is a stark reminder of the need for a free and independent press. The public deserves better from their news sources, and CNN must do better in their reporting to regain the trust of their viewers.
