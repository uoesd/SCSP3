Mission Accomplished, Lives Lost: Canada's Afghanistan Withdrawal Marred by Deadly Attack

OTTAWA – Just hours before a devastating attack on Kabul airport, Canada's military mission in Afghanistan came to a close. Suicide bombers targeted crowds at the airport, killing at least 11 American marines and one navy medic, and leaving an unknown number of Canadians and their families trapped in the country.

Despite the tragic turn of events, Canadian Forces confirmed that all Canadian military personnel involved in the withdrawal are safe and accounted for. Acting Chief of the Defence Staff, Gen. Wayne Eyre, acknowledged the unpredictability of warfare and the rapid Taliban takeover, but emphasized that the mission aimed to meet the U.S.-led deadline of August 31.

In the wake of the attack, Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, Commander of U.S. Central Command, highlighted the real threat of ISIS and continued evacuation efforts despite the attacks. The U.S. attributes the attacks to ISIS-K, with the expectation of further attacks. Canada evacuated approximately 3,700 people from Afghanistan, with Gen. McKenzie expressing gratitude for Canada's contributions to the mission.

The war in Afghanistan has come at a heavy cost, with over 47,000 Afghan civilians and more than 66,000 Afghan military and police dying in the conflict. As the dust settles on Canada's military mission, the focus shifts to the ongoing humanitarian efforts and the safety of those still stranded in the country.

In a statement, Gen. Eyre offered condolences to the families of the victims and reiterated Canada's commitment to supporting the people of Afghanistan. "We will continue to work with our allies and partners to ensure the safety and security of those who remain in the country," he said.
