Colin Powell's Other Passion: Tinkering in the Garage

Colin Powell, the former secretary of state and four-star general, was known for his leadership and diplomatic skills, but few knew about his secret hobby - tinkering in his garage. Powell enjoyed fixing things, especially cars, and found solace in the tangible results of his work, a contrast to the complexities of foreign policy.

Powell's hobby was rooted in frugality, curiosity, and a drive to repair rather than discard. His son, Michael, recalled his father's effort to fix a batch of defective adding machines, a task that exemplified his resourcefulness and determination.

Powell's career was marked by a swift rise to become a four-star general and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He became secretary of state under George W. Bush, but faced a dilemma with the decision to invade Iraq, which contradicted the Powell doctrine. Regretting his UN speech that falsely claimed Saddam Hussein had illicit weapons, Powell considered it the biggest mistake of his career.

After leaving the Bush administration, Powell remained influential, advising foreign diplomats and leaders, and engaging in private sector and educational activities. Despite his busy schedule, he always found time to tinker in his garage.

"He loved to work on cars, to fix things, to figure out how things worked," said Richard Armitage, a longtime friend and deputy secretary of state. "It was a way for him to unwind, to get away from the pressures of his job."

Powell's passion for tinkering was not limited to cars. He also enjoyed working on motorcycles, lawn mowers, and even household appliances. His longtime assistant, Peggy Cifrino, recalled how he once fixed a broken blender, much to her surprise.

"He was always curious about how things worked, and he loved to take things apart and put them back together," Cifrino said. "He was like a kid in a candy store when it came to tools and gadgets."

Powell's love for tinkering was not just a hobby, but a reflection of his character. It showed his attention to detail, his perseverance, and his willingness to get his hands dirty.

"He was a man of action, not just words," said Michael Powell. "He believed in fixing things, not just talking about them. That was his approach to life, and it was something he passed down to me and my siblings."

Even as secretary of state, Powell found solace in tinkering in his garage, contrasting the tangible results with the complexities of foreign policy. It was a way for him to escape the pressures of his job and to feel a sense of accomplishment.

Powell's personal interests and struggles provide insight into his character beyond his public persona. His hobby was not just a pastime, but a reflection of his values and his approach to life.

Sadly, Powell's life was cut short by multiple myeloma, a disease he battled for several years. He continued his treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center until his last days, but his love for tinkering never faded.

"Even when he was going through treatment, he would still find time to work on his cars," said Armitage. "It was a source of comfort and joy for him, a reminder of the simple pleasures in life."

Colin Powell's legacy extends beyond his military and diplomatic achievements. His love for tinkering is a reminder of his humanity, his humility, and his passion for life. He will be remembered not just as a great leader, but as a man who enjoyed fixing things, one tool at a time.
