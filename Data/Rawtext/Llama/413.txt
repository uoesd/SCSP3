Feds Weigh Charges Against Ex-Cop in George Floyd's Death

WASHINGTON (AP) – A federal grand jury is considering charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd, who died after Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for several minutes. Chauvin is already facing state murder and manslaughter charges, with his trial set to begin on March 8.

The federal investigation, which focuses on Chauvin and involves other officers as witnesses, is part of a broader Justice Department strategy under the new administration to combat racial discrimination in policing. Judge Merrick Garland, nominee for attorney general, pledged to prioritize civil rights and policing policies during his confirmation hearing.

George Floyd's death on May 25 led to nationwide protests and a reckoning on race in the United States. Three other officers are charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin and will face trial in August. The increased grand jury activity may be part of a broader strategy by the Justice Department to hold police officers accountable for civil rights violations.

Last year, former Attorney General William Barr blocked a potential plea deal involving Chauvin. The Justice Department under President Joe Biden is expected to take a different approach, with a greater emphasis on civil rights and policing policies.

The federal investigation into Chauvin's actions is ongoing, and it's unclear what specific charges he might face. However, the grand jury's consideration of charges suggests that the Justice Department is taking a serious look at the case.

The death of George Floyd was a turning point in the national conversation about police brutality and systemic racism. The protests that followed his death called for justice and accountability, and the federal investigation and potential charges against Chauvin are a response to those demands.

The Justice Department's focus on civil rights and policing policies is a shift from the previous administration, which was criticized for its handling of police brutality cases. Under President Biden, the department is expected to take a more aggressive approach to addressing racial discrimination in policing.

The federal investigation into Chauvin's actions is just one part of a broader effort to address police brutality and systemic racism. The Justice Department is also reviewing policing practices and policies across the country, looking for ways to improve accountability and transparency.

The death of George Floyd and the subsequent protests highlighted the need for police reform and accountability. The federal investigation and potential charges against Chauvin are a step towards addressing those concerns and ensuring that police officers are held accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, the federal grand jury's consideration of charges against Derek Chauvin is a significant development in the ongoing effort to hold police officers accountable for civil rights violations. The Justice Department's focus on civil rights and policing policies is a positive step towards addressing systemic racism and ensuring that justice is served.
