UAE Signs Deal for F-35 Jets and Drones Hours Before Biden Inauguration

WASHINGTON – In a last-minute agreement, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) signed a deal on January 20 to purchase up to 50 F-35 jets and 18 MQ-9 Reaper drones from the United States, just one hour before President Joe Biden's inauguration. The agreement, solidified through a letter of agreement between US and UAE officials, marks one of the final acts of the Trump administration.

The deal, valued at approximately $23.37 billion, includes not only the aircraft and drones but also a wide array of munitions. While the specifics of the deal, including cost and technical specifications, have been established, the first delivery date, potentially in 2027, remains unconfirmed.

Future negotiations could adjust the financial details of the agreement, particularly with Lockheed Martin and General Atomics, the manufacturers of the F-35 and MQ-9, respectively. The Biden administration's stance on the deal is unclear, though it has expressed intentions to review it carefully.

Antony Blinken, Biden's nominee for Secretary of State, emphasized the need to maintain Israel's qualitative military edge when considering the sale. The US Senate failed to block the sale in December, with votes showing a partisan split favoring the deal.

Requests for comments from the departments of State and Defense went unanswered. The deal's timing, mere hours before the inauguration, raises questions about the Trump administration's motives and the Biden administration's willingness to honor the agreement.

The UAE's purchase of the F-35 jets and MQ-9 Reaper drones marks a significant milestone in the country's military modernization efforts. The acquisition of these advanced weapons systems is expected to enhance the UAE's regional security and defense capabilities.

In conclusion, the UAE's deal with the US for F-35 jets and MQ-9 Reaper drones, signed just before President Biden's inauguration, highlights the complex geopolitical dynamics at play in the Middle East. The deal's fate under the new administration remains uncertain, but it is clear that the UAE is committed to strengthening its military capabilities to address regional security challenges.
