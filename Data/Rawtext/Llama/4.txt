Biden Inaugurated as 46th President, Calls for Unity and Democracy

WASHINGTON (AP) – Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday, emphasizing democracy's triumph and calling for unity in a ceremony marked by heightened security and no crowds due to the pandemic and recent Capitol siege.

Biden, a Democrat, took the oath of office on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol, with Chief Justice John Roberts administering the oath. In his inaugural address, Biden indirectly rebuked his predecessor, Donald Trump, focusing on democracy, unity, and the challenges America faces such as COVID-19, economic strain, and racial injustice.

"We've learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed," Biden said. "We have to be different than this. We have to be better than this. We have to be the nation that we know we can be."

Kamala Harris made history as the first woman, first Black person, and first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency. She was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

The inauguration took place with over 200,000 American flags planted on the National Mall to represent those who couldn't attend the inauguration. The ceremony was attended by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, highlighting bipartisan support.

Biden signed a series of executive actions on his first day, including rejoining the Paris Climate Accords and instituting a mask mandate on federal property. He enters office with a plan for an ambitious first 100 days, focusing on combating the pandemic and economic relief.

The inauguration ceremony included performances by Lady Gaga and others, with a focus on national unity and healing. The absence of crowds and the presence of a large security force marked this as an unusual inauguration.

Biden's speech was a call to action, urging Americans to come together to address the nation's challenges. "Let's start afresh. All of us. Let's start afresh," he said. "Let's work together. We can do this. We can do this. We can do this."

The ceremony was held under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed over 400,000 Americans and left millions more struggling economically. Biden has promised to make combating the pandemic a top priority, and his first executive actions reflected that focus.

In his speech, Biden also addressed the economic strain faced by many Americans, promising to work towards recovery and job creation. He also acknowledged the racial injustice that continues to plague the nation, saying, "A cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer."

Biden's inauguration marked a turning point in American history, as the nation looks to move forward from the divisive and tumultuous Trump era. The new president's call for unity and action was met with hope and optimism by many Americans, who are eager for a fresh start and a brighter future.
