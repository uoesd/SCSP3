Harris Aims to Tackle Root Causes of Migration, Not Just Manage the Border

CNN – Washington D.C. – Vice President Kamala Harris is taking on a new role, leading efforts to address the root causes of migration from Central America, rather than just managing the U.S. southern border. President Joe Biden tasked Harris with working with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries to stem migration, but Harris and her team are concerned about being politically linked to the border situation, fearing it could be damaging.

Despite this, Harris is preparing for a trip to Guatemala and Mexico to discuss issues driving Central American migration to the U.S. Her role includes securing commitments from private companies to invest in the Northern Triangle countries. Officials and experts assert that addressing migration causes can't be separated from the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The pandemic and economic downturn have exacerbated migration from Latin America to the U.S., making Harris' task all the more pressing. She is seen as a key figure for the Democratic Party in the 2024 presidential race and is keen on fulfilling her newly assigned task.

Harris has been engaging with immigration advocates and regional experts to gather a wide range of information on addressing the migration issue. She has also been criticized by Republican critics and the media, who have portrayed her immigration role as a border assignment.

However, Harris and her team are determined to focus on addressing the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and political instability in Central America. They believe that addressing these issues will help reduce the number of people attempting to cross the border, ultimately making the situation more manageable.

Harris' trip to Guatemala and Mexico is expected to be a key moment in her efforts to address the root causes of migration. She is expected to meet with leaders from both countries to discuss ways to increase investment and create economic opportunities in the Northern Triangle region.

The Biden administration has been under pressure to address the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, where thousands of migrants have been gathered in recent months. Harris' efforts to address the root causes of migration are seen as a key part of the administration's strategy to address the issue.

Harris has been working closely with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other officials to develop a comprehensive approach to addressing migration. She has also been engaging with members of Congress, including Republicans, to build bipartisan support for her efforts.

The vice president's team believes that addressing the root causes of migration will not only help reduce the number of people attempting to cross the border but also improve the overall stability and security of the region.

Harris' efforts to address migration come at a time when the issue is increasingly becoming a political flashpoint. The Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy on immigration has been widely criticized, and the Biden administration is under pressure to show that it is taking a different approach.
