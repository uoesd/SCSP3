Ever Given Continues to Anchor in Suez Canal, Cargo Owners Consider Abandoning Ship

The Ever Given, a 20,124 teu vessel, remains anchored in the Suez Canal's Great Bitter Lakes area, two and a half months after it was refloated. The ship and its 18,000 teu of cargo are under arrest due to a compensation dispute between the owners and the Suez Canal Authority (SCA). The SCA has lowered its compensation claim from $916m to $550m, rejecting the shipowner's offer of $150m.

Mathu Jagannath, director of NAU Pte, expressed concern over the ongoing dispute, urging the SCA and shipowner to quickly resolve the issue to minimize losses. "The longer the vessel remains under arrest, the more cargo owners will suffer," Jagannath said. "It's in everyone's best interest to find a solution as soon as possible."

North European importers with cargo on the Ever Given are considering abandoning it due to the delays. The SCA attributes the accident to the ship's "excessive speed," while the P&I Club blames SCA's control over navigation. Cargo owners must contribute to salvage costs due to the declaration of General Average, but cannot until the vessel is freed.

The Ever Given is worth $183m, with its value increasing $13m since the grounding. It is unclear if Evergreen, the operator leasing the vessel, continues to pay daily hire while it is under arrest. The shortage and high demand for containership capacity make it urgent for Evergreen to return the Ever Given to service.

The ongoing dispute has caused a ripple effect in the shipping industry, with many cargo owners facing delays and increased costs. The Ever Given was en route to Rotterdam when it ran aground in the Suez Canal, causing a significant disruption to global trade.

The SCA has maintained that the ship's speed was the primary cause of the accident, while the P&I Club, which represents the ship's interests, argues that the SCA's control over navigation was a contributing factor. The dispute has led to a stalemate, with neither side willing to budge on the compensation amount.

The Ever Given's cargo includes a variety of goods, including electronics, machinery, and textiles. Cargo owners are growing increasingly frustrated with the delays, with some considering abandoning their shipments altogether.

The situation is further complicated by the declaration of General Average, which means that cargo owners must contribute to the salvage costs. However, they cannot do so until the vessel is freed, leaving them in a state of limbo.

The Ever Given's value has increased since the grounding, with its worth now estimated at $183m. It is unclear if Evergreen, the operator leasing the vessel, continues to pay daily hire while it is under arrest.

The shipping industry is facing a shortage of containership capacity, making it crucial for Evergreen to return the Ever Given to service as soon as possible. The ongoing dispute is causing significant disruptions to global trade, with many cargo owners facing delays and increased costs.

In conclusion, the Ever Given's continued anchorage in the Suez Canal highlights the ongoing dispute between the SCA and the shipowner. The situation is causing significant disruptions to global trade, with cargo owners facing delays and increased costs. It is in everyone's best interest to find a solution as soon as possible to minimize losses and get the Ever Given back in service.
