Rep. Jerry Nadler's Claim on Kyle Rittenhouse Crossing State Lines with Gun is False

In a recent tweet, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) made a claim about Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who was acquitted for the shootings during the 2020 Kenosha unrest. Nadler stated that Rittenhouse had crossed state lines armed, suggesting he was seeking trouble. However, a PolitiFact investigation has found that this claim is false.

During the trial, it was revealed that Rittenhouse did not transport the gun across state lines. The AR-15 style gun was purchased by Dominick Black, Rittenhouse's friend, in Wisconsin, and was stored at Black's home in Kenosha. Rittenhouse faced a misdemeanor charge for gun possession as a minor, which was dismissed.

Dan Rubin, a spokesperson for Nadler, clarified that the tweet was not meant to imply that Rittenhouse was armed when he crossed state lines, but rather that he had crossed state lines and was armed at some point during the unrest. However, this clarification does not align with the original wording of the tweet, which specifically stated that Rittenhouse had crossed state lines "armed."

The misinformation in Nadler's tweet contributes to the confusion surrounding the details of the case. The AR-15 was kept in a safe at Black's home in Kenosha and was only accessed by Rittenhouse during the unrest. Rittenhouse's acquittal has sparked varied reactions, and the spread of misinformation does not help in understanding the facts of the case.

Based on trial testimony and evidence, it is clear that Rittenhouse did not transport the gun across state lines. Therefore, PolitiFact rates Nadler's claim as false.

It is important for public figures to ensure the accuracy of their statements, especially in high-profile cases like this one. The spread of misinformation can lead to further confusion and division, and it is crucial to rely on credible sources when sharing information.

In conclusion, Rep. Jerry Nadler's claim that Kyle Rittenhouse crossed state lines armed is false. The gun was purchased and stored in Wisconsin, and Rittenhouse did not transport it across state lines. It is important to rely on credible sources and ensure the accuracy of statements, especially in high-profile cases like this one.
