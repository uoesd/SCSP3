Trump Snubs Biden's Inauguration, Breaking Tradition

WASHINGTON (AP) – In a break with tradition, President Donald Trump has announced that he will not attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, a decision that has been met with criticism and concern.

Trump's decision not to attend the inauguration on January 20th is seen as an act of defiance and a departure from the peaceful transition of power that has been a hallmark of American democracy.

"I don't think it's a good thing," Biden said in response to Trump's announcement. "I think it's an embarrassment, quite frankly."

Historically, outgoing and incoming presidents have attended the inauguration together, symbolizing the smooth transition of power. Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, except the ailing Jimmy Carter, have all confirmed their attendance at Biden's inauguration.

Trump's announcement came amidst discussions of his second impeachment and after he was banned from Twitter. The President has continued to falsely claim that he won the election and has alleged widespread voter fraud.

Vice President Mike Pence's attendance at the inauguration is still uncertain, though Biden has welcomed him. "I hope that he does come," Biden said. "I think it's important for the country."

Historian Douglas Brinkley suggests that Trump's absence portrays him as a "sore loser" and undermines democracy. "It's a very big deal," Brinkley said. "It's a statement that he's not accepting the results of the election."

Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) echoed Brinkley's sentiments, saying, "I think it's important for the President to attend the inauguration. It's a symbol of the peaceful transfer of power."

Devin O'Malley, a spokesperson for Vice President Pence, said that the Vice President has not yet made a decision on whether he will attend the inauguration.

Judd Deere, a White House spokesperson, said that Trump's decision not to attend the inauguration was made "in light of the current political climate."

Discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment or impeachment are ongoing amidst concerns about Trump's actions in his final days.

Trump's decision not to attend the inauguration has sparked criticism from both sides of the aisle, with many seeing it as a threat to the stability of the country.

"It's a very dangerous precedent," Brinkley said. "It's a statement that he's not accepting the results of the election and that he's willing to undermine the democratic process."

In contrast, Biden has emphasized the importance of a peaceful transition of power, saying, "I think it's important for the country to see that we can transfer power in a peaceful way."

As the country prepares for the inauguration, concerns about Trump's actions in his final days continue to mount.

"I think it's important for the President to attend the inauguration," Scott said. "It's a symbol of the peaceful transfer of power and a reminder that we are a democracy."

Despite Trump's decision not to attend, Biden has reiterated his invitation to Pence, saying, "I hope that he does come. I think it's important for the country."

As the political world continues to grapple with the implications of Trump's decision, one thing is clear: the peaceful transition of power that has been a hallmark of American democracy for centuries is under threat.

"It's a very big deal," Brinkley said. "It's a statement that he's not accepting the results of the election and that he's willing to undermine the democratic process."
