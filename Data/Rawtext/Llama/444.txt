Harry and Meghan: A Royal Departure from Social Media

In a move that may signal a shift in the way celebrities and public figures engage with social media, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, have reportedly quit social media. The couple, who had amassed over 10 million followers on their official royal Instagram account, @sussexroyal, have become disillusioned with the "hate" they encountered online, particularly on platforms like Instagram.

According to The Sunday Times, there are no plans for their non-profit, Archewell, to use social media, nor for them to return personally. This decision comes amid criticism of social media companies for their role in political events, specifically referencing Donald Trump's indefinite suspension.

Harry and Meghan's move away from social media follows their step down as senior royals and a move towards financial independence in the US. In a recent interview, Meghan spoke out about the severe impact of online abuse on her mental health, claiming to be the most trolled person in 2019.

Archewell aims to drive systemic cultural change through non-profit work and media production, without an official social media presence. The couple has signed deals with Spotify and Netflix to produce podcasts and documentaries.

Previously, they had stated an intention to continue using social media after stepping down as senior royals. However, it appears that the constant barrage of negative comments and the toll it took on their mental health was too much to bear.

Their decision to quit social media is a significant one, given their high profile and the fact that they are not the first celebrities to take a step back from social media. In recent years, several celebrities have spoken out about the negative effects of social media on their mental health and well-being.

It remains to be seen whether other celebrities will follow in Harry and Meghan's footsteps and quit social media altogether. However, their decision is a powerful statement about the need for a healthier online environment and the importance of taking care of one's mental health.

In the meantime, the couple's non-profit, Archewell, will continue to produce content and drive positive change without the aid of social media. It's a bold move, but one that may inspire others to rethink their relationship with social media and its impact on their lives.
