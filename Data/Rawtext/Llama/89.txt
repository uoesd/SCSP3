Citibank Loses Nearly $900 Million in Accidental Wire Transfer Fiasco

New York CNN Business – In a stunning turn of events, Citibank has been left reeling after a clerical error resulted in the accidental transfer of nearly $900 million to Revlon's lenders. The blunder, which occurred in August, has sparked a legal battle between the bank and the lenders, with a US District Court judge ruling that Citibank cannot recover the majority of the funds.

According to court documents, Citibank intended to transfer $8 million in interest payments to Revlon's lenders, but a mistake in the bank's internal systems led to the erroneous transfer of $893 million. The accidental transfer included $175 million to a hedge fund, with a total of $500 million still unrecovered from 10 investment advisory firms.

Benjamin Finestone, a lawyer representing two of the lenders, Brigade and HPS Investment Partners, stated, "Our clients were entitled to the money as part of a prepayment of a loan. They had no reason to believe it was an accidental transfer."

New York law has a "discharge-for-value-defense" provision, which allows beneficiaries to keep money if they are entitled to it and were unaware it was sent accidentally. The court found that the lenders' belief that the payment was intentional was justified, citing Citibank's sophistication as making a mistake seem improbable.

Internal chats from HPS employees joking about the mistake were used as evidence they were unaware the wiring was a mistake. "It's not our problem, it's Citibank's problem," one employee wrote in a chat.

A temporary restraining order has been issued, preventing the lenders from utilizing the funds due to the potential for an appeal. Citigroup has expressed its strong disagreement with the decision and intends to appeal, aiming to recover the full amount transferred.

The pandemic has had a significant impact on makeup brands such as Revlon, with its shares trading over 40% lower than a year ago. The accidental transfer has only added to the company's financial woes.

Citibank has maintained that the transfer was a mistake and has taken steps to recover the funds. In a statement, the bank said, "We are disappointed by the court's decision and will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to recover the funds that were mistakenly transferred."

The incident has raised questions about the internal controls at Citibank and the potential consequences for the bank's reputation. "This is a major embarrassment for Citibank, and it's a reminder that even the biggest financial institutions can make mistakes," said financial analyst, Jim Cramer.

The legal battle between Citibank and Revlon's lenders is ongoing, with both sides dug in for a long fight. The case has sparked a heated debate in the financial community, with some arguing that the lenders should be required to return the funds, while others believe they are entitled to keep them.

In the meantime, Revlon's lenders are in a holding pattern, awaiting the outcome of the appeal. The accidental transfer has created a complex web of legal and financial issues, with no clear resolution in sight.

As the dust settles on this unprecedented incident, one thing is clear: Citibank's accidental transfer has sent shockwaves through the financial industry, serving as a cautionary tale about the importance of internal controls and the potential consequences of even the smallest mistakes.
