Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Ink Multi-Book Deal with Penguin Random House

In a surprise move, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have signed a multi-book deal with Penguin Random House, initially believed to be a $20 million deal for Harry's memoirs. The couple is set to release four books, with Harry's memoir being the first to hit shelves in late 2022. Contrary to reports, the memoir will not be split into two parts.

The multi-book deal includes a book on leadership and philanthropy, co-authored by Harry and Meghan. Meghan is also rumored to be working on a memoir of her own, as well as a book on wellness. While the details of the books are still under wraps, a source suggests that Meghan's memoir might touch on her political aspirations.

Harry's memoir aims to share his personal journey, highlighting shared human experiences and lessons learned. In a statement, Harry expressed his hope that his story will inspire readers to find their own path and to make a positive difference in the world. Meghan's children's book, 'The Bench', published earlier this year, is not part of the four-book deal with Penguin Random House. The book, described by Meghan as a love letter to her husband and son, showcases tender aspects of masculinity. With this multi-book deal, Harry and Meghan are set to share their stories and experiences with the world in a unique and intimate way.
