Michigan High School Shooting Suspect Had Meetings with Parents, School Officials Before Attack

On Tuesday, a shooting at Oxford High School in Michigan left four students dead and seven others injured. The suspect, 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, has been charged as an adult with murder, terrorism, and other crimes. New details have emerged about the events leading up to the shooting, including meetings between the suspect, his parents, and school officials.

According to Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard, the suspect's office was unaware of any alarming behavior prior to the shooting. However, two teachers raised concerns about the suspect's behavior, leading to meetings with school officials. The suspect's parents were also involved in these meetings, which took place just hours before the attack.

The gun used in the attack was bought by the suspect's father four days before the shooting. Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald has stated that she is considering charges against the suspect's parents, citing a "mountain of digital evidence" suggesting the shooting was premeditated.

At the arraignment, it was revealed that the suspect had made videos and kept a journal outlining plans for the shooting. The suspect faces life without parole if convicted.

Prosecutor McDonald has called for revisiting gun laws in light of the shooting. "We need to take a hard look at our gun laws and make sure that we're doing everything we can to keep our community safe," she said.

Oakland County Assistant Prosecutor Marc Keast echoed McDonald's sentiments, stating, "We need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to prevent these types of tragedies from happening in the future."

The shooting has left the community reeling, with many calling for increased security measures in schools. "It's just heartbreaking," said one parent. "I can't imagine what the families of the victims are going through."

The suspect is being held without bail and is due back in court next week. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities working to determine a motive for the shooting.

In the wake of the tragedy, community members have come together to support the victims' families. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help cover funeral expenses and other costs.

The shooting has also sparked a renewed debate about gun control, with many calling for stricter laws to prevent similar tragedies. "It's time for us to take action," said one local resident. "We can't just sit back and let these shootings continue to happen."

As the community continues to heal, the focus is now on ensuring that such a tragedy never happens again. "We need to do better," said one parent. "We need to make sure that our kids are safe in school."

The shooting at Oxford High School is a stark reminder of the dangers that exist in our society. It is up to all of us to work together to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.
