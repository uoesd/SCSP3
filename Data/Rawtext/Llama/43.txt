Biden Administration Unveils Plan to Combat White Supremacist and Militia Violence

June 15 – The Biden administration has announced a comprehensive plan to combat the growing threat of white supremacist and militia violence, labeling these groups as top national security threats. The strategy, which was unveiled on Tuesday, includes increased information sharing, additional resources for identifying and prosecuting threats, and new deterrents against joining dangerous groups.

According to a senior administration official, the plan is designed to address the elevated threat posed by white supremacists and militias, who have been responsible for a spate of violent attacks in recent years. "We recognize the urgent need to address this threat and protect the American people," the official said.

The plan does not propose new laws but aims to use existing authority more effectively. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the reinvigoration of an interagency task force to combat domestic terrorism, which will include representatives from the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and other relevant agencies.

The FBI views racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, especially those advocating for white supremacy, as the top domestic violent extremist threat. "We are committed to using all tools at our disposal to disrupt and dismantle these groups," said FBI Director Christopher Wray.

To support the effort, Biden's budget proposal seeks an additional $100 million to train and hire analysts and prosecutors to counteract terrorist activity. The administration is also emphasizing the need for resources and personnel to address the elevated threat.

One key aspect of the plan is improved screening methods to identify employees who may pose insider threats. The federal government will share techniques with private companies to help them identify and prevent potential threats.

The Department of Defense is also reviewing how to remove military members engaged in domestic terrorist groups. The review will focus on defining extremists while respecting rights. "We must ensure that our military remains a place where all service members feel safe and respected," said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

The plan has received bipartisan support, with lawmakers from both parties praising the administration's efforts to address the growing threat of white supremacist and militia violence. "This is a critical step forward in protecting our communities from the scourge of domestic terrorism," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

The administration's plan comes as the country continues to grapple with the rise of white supremacist and militia groups. In recent years, these groups have been responsible for a number of high-profile attacks, including the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the 2020 plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

The plan is seen as a critical step in addressing the threat of domestic terrorism and ensuring the safety and security of all Americans. "We will not tolerate violence and hate in our country," said President Biden. "We will do everything in our power to prevent it and to protect our people."

In conclusion, the Biden administration's plan to combat white supremacist and militia violence is a comprehensive effort to address a growing national security threat. With increased information sharing, additional resources, and new deterrents, the plan aims to protect the American people and ensure the safety and security of all communities.
