Third Batch of California Stimulus Checks to be Sent Out on Oct. 5

Sacramento, CA - The third batch of California stimulus checks is set to be sent out on October 5, with payments being made to eligible residents as part of the Golden State Stimulus program. The size of the upcoming batch is currently unknown, but previous batches were sent to 2 million and 600,000 Californians respectively.

According to Gov. Gavin Newsom, "The Golden State Stimulus is designed to help address the inequities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic and support those who are facing the greatest hardship." The program aims to provide financial relief to those who have been impacted the most by the COVID-19 pandemic.

It's estimated that about 9 million Californians are eligible for the payments, with eligibility and payment amounts varying based on previous stimulus qualification and claiming of dependents. The California Franchise Tax Board provides a tool for estimating individual payment amounts.

This round of payments will include mailed paper checks in addition to direct deposits, with payments being sent in two-week intervals. The previous batches were sent on August 27 and September 17.

Gov. Newsom signed a bill on July 12 that includes $12 billion in pandemic relief, with the stimulus program being a key part of the effort to support Californians during this challenging time.

The Golden State Stimulus program is part of a larger effort to address the economic impacts of the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected low-income and minority communities. By providing financial relief to those who need it most, the program aims to support the recovery and resilience of these communities.

As the pandemic continues to affect Californians, the Golden State Stimulus program is a critical lifeline for those who are struggling to make ends meet. With the third batch of payments set to be sent out on October 5, eligible residents can expect to receive their payments in the coming weeks.

In conclusion, the third batch of California stimulus checks is set to be sent out on October 5, with payments being made to eligible residents as part of the Golden State Stimulus program. With a focus on addressing inequities and supporting those facing the greatest hardship, the program aims to provide critical financial relief to those who need it most.
