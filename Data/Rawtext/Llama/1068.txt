BLUE POINT, Long Island (WABC) – A 22-year-old woman from Long Island has gone missing while traveling in Wyoming, and her family is desperate for answers. Gabrielle Petito was last heard from on August 30, and her mother, Nicole Schmidt, is pleading for the public's help in finding her daughter.

According to Schmidt, Petito was traveling with her boyfriend in a white 2012 Ford Transit van, documenting their cross-country trip on YouTube. They had planned to arrive in Portland, Oregon, in October. However, the last communication from Petito was a text message received by her mother on August 30.

"I'm just feeling so helpless, and I just want my daughter back," Schmidt said in a statement. "I'm asking for anyone who may have seen or heard from Gabrielle to please come forward. We just want to know that she's safe."

Petito is described as a white female, approximately 5-foot-5 and 110 pounds, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and several tattoos. Her boyfriend is not missing, and their van was recovered in Florida.

The North Port Police Department released a statement urging the public to contact Crime Stoppers or the North Port Police Department with any information regarding Petito's disappearance.

"We are deeply concerned for Gabrielle's safety and well-being, and we are working tirelessly to locate her," said a spokesperson for the North Port Police Department. "We urge anyone who may have seen or heard from her to come forward and help us bring her home safely."

The family has set up a GoFundMe page to help with the search efforts. Anyone with information is asked to contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-TIPS (8477) or the North Port Police Department at 941-429-7300.
