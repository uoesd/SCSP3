Virginia Democratic Delegate Accuses Mossad of Fueling Wars, Draws Criticism

ARLINGTON, Virginia – Virginia Democratic delegate Ibraheem Samirah has sparked controversy with a series of tweets accusing Israel's Mossad of creating "fossil fuel wars," including the Iran-Iraq war and the 2003 Iraq war. Samirah's comments have drawn criticism from Republicans and Jewish groups, who argue that his statements perpetuate harmful stereotypes and conspiracy theories.

In a tweet agreeing with the Sunrise Movement's call to boycott a rally due to the participation of Jewish movements with Israel ties, Samirah referenced a Guardian article alleging Mossad's role in creating wars. However, the article did not support his claim. Samirah also blamed Israel for the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, citing a 1986 New York Times article about Israel's weapons deals with the Shah of Iran.

Boris Epshteyn, a Jewish adviser to former President Donald Trump, questioned the silence from Jewish Democratic groups, saying, "It's disturbing to see yet another example of antisemitic rhetoric from a Democratic official. When will Jewish Democratic groups speak out against this hate?"

The Democratic Majority for Israel dismissed Samirah's remarks, noting his defeat in a recent Democratic primary. "It's unfortunate that Delegate Samirah has chosen to spread harmful conspiracy theories and perpetuate antisemitic stereotypes," the group said in a statement.

Samirah, who is of Palestinian American descent, has been previously noted for disrupting a rally by Donald Trump in 2019. His father, a Muslim activist, was deported in 2003 by the Bush administration but ordered returned by a US judge a decade later.

Samirah's comments have also drawn criticism from Republicans, who argue that his statements are a reflection of a larger problem within the Democratic Party. "It's becoming increasingly clear that the Democratic Party has a problem with antisemitism," said Republican National Committee spokesperson Elizabeth Harrington. "It's time for Democrats to take a stand against this hate and condemn Delegate Samirah's harmful rhetoric."

In response to the backlash, Samirah has doubled down on his claims, tweeting, "I'm not afraid to speak the truth, even if it means facing backlash from powerful interests. The American people deserve to know the truth about our government's actions, and I will continue to fight for transparency and accountability."

The controversy surrounding Samirah's comments highlights the ongoing debate within the Democratic Party over issues related to Israel and antisemitism. While some progressive lawmakers have been critical of Israel's actions, others have argued that such criticism can sometimes cross the line into harmful stereotypes and conspiracy theories. The party's leadership has sought to balance these competing views, but incidents like Samirah's tweets have raised concerns about the party's ability to address the issue effectively.
