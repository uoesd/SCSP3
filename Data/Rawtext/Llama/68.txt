Capitol Riot Defendants Point Fingers at Trump, But Legal Experts Say It Won't Necessarily Save Them

As the investigation into the Capitol riot continues, nearly 200 defendants are pointing their fingers at former President Donald Trump, claiming he incited them to violence on January 6. However, legal experts say that while Trump's influence may not exonerate the accused, it could lead to reduced sentences or plea deals.

According to Clint Broden, an attorney for Garret Miller, one of the accused rioters, "My client and many others believed they were following the instructions of the President of the United States. They were told to fight like hell, and they took that as a call to action."

Enrique Latoison, an attorney for Robert Sanford, another accused rioter, echoed Broden's sentiments. "My client was acting on the instructions of the President. He believed he was doing what was necessary to protect the country."

However, Trump's defense attorneys deny that he incited the riot, placing the blame squarely on the rioters themselves. "The President's speech was not a call to violence," said Michael Stokes Paulsen, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas. "It was a call to political action, and the rioters are responsible for their own actions."

Despite this, statements by the accused that they were acting on Trump's instructions may be used in the impeachment trial against him. "The fact that the rioters believed they were following Trump's orders could be seen as evidence of his culpability," said Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University.

Some experts believe that the concept of "public authority defense" might be argued in court. This defense suggests that the rioters believed they were acting on government orders, and therefore, their actions were justified. However, legal experts are skeptical that this defense will hold up in court.

Ziv Cohen, a clinical psychiatrist, noted that the accused rioters' cult-like loyalty to Trump is a common phenomenon in cases of incitement. "When individuals are deeply invested in a leader or ideology, they may feel compelled to act on their behalf, even if it means breaking the law."

While the influence of Trump and other officials may be considered as a mitigating factor, it is unlikely to completely absolve the defendants of their crimes. "The fact that the rioters were following Trump's orders does not excuse their behavior," said Paulsen. "They are still responsible for their actions, even if they believed they were acting on behalf of the government."

Some rioters explicitly stated that their actions were in response to Trump's call, including storming the Capitol if he requested. However, legal experts say that these statements may not be enough to acquit the defendants.

Ultimately, the outcome of the Capitol riot cases will depend on the specific circumstances of each defendant's actions and the evidence presented in court. While Trump's influence may be a factor in their defense, it is unlikely to completely exonerate them.

As the investigation and legal proceedings continue, the role of Trump and other officials in the Capitol riot will likely be a central focus. However, it remains to be seen how much their influence will impact the legal outcomes for the accused individuals.
