Kabul Airport Attack Highlights Chaos of US Withdrawal from Afghanistan

The suicide bombing at Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport on August 26, which killed 13 US service members and dozens of Afghans, has sparked outrage and raised questions about the handling of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The attack, claimed by ISIS-K, was carried out by Abdul Rehman Al-Loghri, a former prisoner released from Parwan prison near Kabul days before the attack.

According to two US officials and Rep. Ken Calvert (R-CA), the suicide bomber was identified as Abdul Rehman Al-Loghri. Calvert, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, criticized the handling of the withdrawal, linking it to the events leading to the airport attack. "The fact that the terrorist who carried out this heinous attack was released from prison after the Taliban took control of the area is a stark reminder of the risks associated with the hasty withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan," Calvert said in a statement.

The Taliban took control of Parwan prison, where Al-Loghri was being held, when they seized Bagram air base and Pul-e-Charkhi prison near Kabul. The prison break allowed several prisoners, including members of ISIS-K, to escape. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley warned of the potential reconstitution of al Qaeda or ISIS-K within 6 to 36 months, highlighting the security risks associated with the US withdrawal.

The Biden administration has faced criticism for its handling of the withdrawal, particularly the decision to abandon Bagram air base, a crucial military complex. Officials estimated that there were 5,000 prisoners at Bagram at the time of handover, the majority identified as terrorists. The rapid fall of Afghan districts and eventual control of Kabul by the Taliban was accelerated by the US withdrawal.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin defended the decision to leave Bagram, emphasizing the focus on protecting the US embassy. "We made the decision to prioritize the safety and security of our embassy and our personnel in Kabul, and we believe that was the right decision," Austin said in a statement.

The attack on the Kabul airport highlighted the chaotic final days of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the struggle to secure the airport's perimeter. The US has continued to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies from the airport, despite the security risks. The attack has also raised concerns about the potential for future attacks by ISIS-K and other terrorist groups in the region.

In conclusion, the Kabul airport attack carried out by ISIS-K has highlighted the security risks associated with the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The attack has sparked criticism of the handling of the withdrawal and raised concerns about the potential for future attacks by terrorist groups in the region. The US continues to face challenges in securing the airport and protecting its personnel in Kabul, as the Taliban consolidates its control over Afghanistan.
