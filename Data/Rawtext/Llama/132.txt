CNN's Chris Cuomo Recuses Himself from Covering Brother's Sexual Harassment Allegations

NEW YORK (AP) – CNN host Chris Cuomo has announced that he will not cover stories about his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, due to the sexual harassment accusations against him. The decision comes as criticism mounts over the network's handling of the situation, with some arguing that it violates journalistic ethics.

"I cannot cover it, period," Chris Cuomo said at the start of his prime time show on Wednesday. "I don't think it's appropriate for me to be involved in a story about my brother. I think it's important to maintain a level of independence and impartiality, and I don't think I can do that in this case."

The Cuomo brothers had previously appeared together on CNN at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which raised ethical concerns. CNN had a rule preventing Chris Cuomo from covering stories about his brother, which was temporarily suspended during the pandemic.

Andrew Cuomo has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, leading to calls for an independent investigation. Critics, including journalism experts, argue that CNN's decision to allow the Cuomo brothers to interact on air violated journalistic ethics.

"It's a clear conflict of interest," said Steven Thrasher, a journalism professor at Northwestern University. "Chris Cuomo should not be covering stories about his brother, period. It's not appropriate, and it undermines the credibility of CNN."

Scott Stroud, ethics director at the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin, agreed. "It's important for journalists to maintain a level of independence and impartiality, and covering a story about a family member is not consistent with that," he said.

Janice Dean, a meteorologist at Fox News Channel, dismissed Chris Cuomo's statement as insufficient. "It's too little, too late," she said. "CNN should have never allowed the Cuomo brothers to appear together on air in the first place. It's a clear violation of journalistic ethics."

Jacqueline Jones, a professor at Morgan State University's School of Global Journalism and Communication, noted that the situation highlights the blurring lines between news, punditry, and entertainment in broadcast and cable news programming. "It's important for journalists to maintain a level of professionalism and impartiality, and CNN's decision to allow the Cuomo brothers to interact on air violates that," she said.

Despite Chris Cuomo's recusal, CNN continues to cover the story of Gov. Cuomo's allegations on other parts of the network. The situation has sparked a broader discussion about the role of journalism in holding those in power accountable, and the importance of maintaining ethical standards in reporting.

"Journalists have a responsibility to report on powerful people, including those who are accused of wrongdoing," Thrasher said. "It's important that we maintain a level of independence and impartiality in our reporting, and that we avoid conflicts of interest that could undermine our credibility."

Stroud added that the situation highlights the need for clear ethical guidelines in journalism. "It's important for news organizations to have clear rules in place to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain a level of impartiality," he said. "In this case, CNN should have never allowed the Cuomo brothers to appear together on air."

As the story continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how CNN and other news organizations will navigate the challenges of reporting on powerful figures while maintaining ethical standards. One thing is clear, however: the public's trust in journalism is at stake.

"Journalism is built on trust, and when we violate that trust, we risk losing our credibility," Jones said. "It's important that we maintain a level of professionalism and impartiality in our reporting, and that we avoid conflicts of interest that could undermine our credibility."

In the end, the situation highlights the importance of ethical standards in journalism and the need for news organizations to maintain a level of independence and impartiality in their reporting. As the story of Gov. Cuomo's alleged misconduct continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how CNN and other news organizations will navigate the challenges of reporting on powerful figures while maintaining ethical standards.
