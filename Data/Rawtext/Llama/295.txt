U.S. Leads Global Effort to End COVID-19 Pandemic, Commits $4 Billion to COVAX and Shares 80 Million Vaccine Doses Worldwide

Washington, D.C. - The Biden Administration today reaffirmed its commitment to ending the COVID-19 pandemic globally, announcing a series of measures to support the international community in this effort. In a statement, President Joe Biden emphasized the importance of working together to combat the virus and ensure that vaccines are available to all who need them.

To support this effort, the United States has committed $4 billion to the COVAX Facility, a global initiative aimed at facilitating the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. This funding will help boost global vaccine production and ensure that doses are available to countries around the world. In addition, the Biden Administration supports temporarily waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines, a move that will help accelerate the production and distribution of vaccines.

As part of its commitment to sharing vaccines with the global community, the United States has already shared over 4 million doses with Canada and Mexico, and plans to share an additional 80 million doses worldwide by the end of June. The first 25 million doses will be allocated globally, with at least 75% shared through COVAX. Approximately 19 million doses will be distributed to Latin America, the Caribbean, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa via COVAX. Over 6 million doses will be shared directly with countries in need, including Canada, Mexico, India, and the Republic of Korea.

President Biden highlighted the role of strong American leadership in ending the pandemic and improving global health security. "We are committed to working with our international partners to combat the spread of COVID-19 and ensure that vaccines are available to all who need them," he said. "We will continue to work tirelessly to save lives and end this pandemic, without expecting favors or concessions in return."

Future vaccine distribution plans will be announced as the U.S. continues to combat the spread of COVID-19. The Biden Administration is committed to doing everything in its power to support the global effort to end the pandemic and protect the health and well-being of people around the world.
