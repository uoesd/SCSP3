Gabby Petito Remembered in Emotional Memorial Service as Family Calls for Donations to Help Missing Children

Gabby Petito, the 22-year-old woman who was found dead in Wyoming after being missing for over two weeks, was remembered in a heartfelt memorial service in New York on Saturday. The service was attended by her family, friends, and members of the community who came to pay their respects and celebrate her life.

Joseph Petito, Gabby's father, spoke at the service, sharing memories of his daughter and urging those in attendance to live fully and leave unhealthy relationships. "Gabby was a free spirit, a kind-hearted person who loved everyone," he said. "She had a way of making everyone feel welcome and loved."

Jim Schmidt, Gabby's stepfather, also spoke at the service, expressing his love and gratitude for the time he had with Gabby. "She was my daughter, my friend, and my confidant," he said. "I will always cherish the memories we made together."

The Petito family used an empty urn at the memorial service, as the FBI has not released Gabby's body to them. Despite this, the family remains hopeful that they will be able to bring Gabby home soon.

Corissa Ambrose, a friend of Gabby's, praised her free-spirited and kind-hearted nature. "Gabby was always up for an adventure, and she had a way of making everyone feel included," she said. "She will be deeply missed, but her memory will live on in our hearts."

The Petito family has requested that donations be made to the Gabby Petito Foundation instead of flowers. The foundation aims to help bring missing children home and support their families during difficult times.

Gabby's death has been ruled a homicide, and her fiancé, Brian, is considered a person of interest in her death. A federal arrest warrant has been issued for him, and the investigation is ongoing.

Gabby's remains were discovered in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, and her last social media post was on August 25. The community has come together to support the Petito family during this difficult time, and a vigil was held in North Port, Florida, with around 200 people honoring Gabby's life.

The memorial service was a celebration of Gabby's life, and it was clear that she had a profound impact on those who knew her. Her family and friends will continue to push for justice and work to keep her memory alive through the Gabby Petito Foundation.

As Joseph Petito said during the service, "Gabby may be gone, but she will never be forgotten. We will continue to fight for her and for all the missing children who need our help."

The service ended with a message of hope and resilience, as the community came together to support the Petito family in their time of need. Gabby's memory will live on, and her legacy will continue to inspire others to live fully and love unconditionally.
