"Rust" Armorer Under Investigation for Alleged Carelessness with Guns on Set

The head armorer of the film "Rust" is under investigation for allegedly being careless with guns on set, leading to a fatal shooting accident that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza. The New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Bureau is looking into the incident, which has raised concerns about safety protocols on film sets.

According to two production sources, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the head armorer, handed a loaded weapon to an 11-year-old actress, Ryan Kiera Armstrong, on a previous film set without properly checking for barrel obstructions. Crew members had to intervene, and filming was paused until the firearm was properly checked. This incident has raised questions about Gutierrez-Reed's experience level and her ability to handle firearms safely.

Gutierrez-Reed had previously expressed concerns over her experience level for the role, stating that she was not sure if she was ready for the job. This was her second film as a head gun handler, with "Rust" being the project where Alec Baldwin fatally shot Hutchins.

Crew members had also raised safety concerns prior to the fatal shooting on "Rust," due to previous accidental prop gun discharges. Despite these concerns, filming continued, leading to the tragic incident that resulted in Hutchins' death and Souza's injury.

The investigation by the New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Bureau is ongoing, and possible civil penalties could be imposed. The incident has highlighted the need for stricter safety protocols on film sets, particularly when it comes to the handling of firearms.
