Michigan School Shooting Leaves 4 Dead, 15-Year-Old Charged with Murder and Terrorism

OXFORD TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) – A 15-year-old boy, Ethan Crumbley, has been charged with murder and terrorism after a shooting at Oxford High School in Michigan that left four students dead and several others injured.

According to Prosecutor Karen McDonald, the shooting was premeditated, and a video recorded by Crumbley discussing his plans to kill students was found. Crumbley faced 24 charges, including murder and attempted murder, and was charged as an adult. A not guilty plea was entered on his behalf.

The incident occurred just hours after a concerning meeting between Crumbley's parents and school officials about his behavior. Crumbley's father, James Crumbley, had purchased the 9 mm Sig Sauer gun used in the shooting just a week prior.

"We have evidence that the gun was purchased by the father, and we have evidence that the gun was used in the shooting," said Sheriff's Lt. Tim Willis.

This was the deadliest school shooting in the U.S. since Santa Fe High School in 2018, marking it among 31 mass killings in the year. Prosecutor McDonald highlighted the need for stricter gun laws and considered charges against Crumbley's parents for failing to secure the firearm.

"We need to take a hard look at our gun laws and make sure that we're doing everything we can to keep our community safe," McDonald said.

The terrorism charge was emphasized due to the broader impact on students, families, and the community. Authorities highlighted the importance of reporting threats to officials and cautioned against spreading rumors on social media.

"We take any threat, whether it's verbal or written, very seriously," said Sheriff Mike Bouchard. "We want to make sure that our community is safe, and we'll do everything we can to keep it that way."

Defense Attorney Scott Kozak declined to comment on the specifics of the case but emphasized the importance of a fair trial.

"We want to make sure that Ethan Crumbley gets a fair trial, and that's all we're focused on right now," Kozak said.

Assistant Prosecutor Marc Keast echoed McDonald's sentiments on the need for stricter gun laws.

"We need to make sure that firearms are kept out of the hands of individuals who pose a risk to themselves or others," Keast said.

Jennifer Crumbley, Ethan's mother, previously wrote an open letter to Donald Trump, discussing her son's struggles, her financial sacrifices, and her support for gun rights.

The shooting has left the community reeling, with many calling for increased security measures in schools.

"We need to do everything we can to prevent these kinds of tragedies from happening," said parent Sarah Johnson. "Our children's safety should be our top priority."

The investigation is ongoing, with authorities working to determine a motive for the shooting.

"We're still trying to figure out why this happened," Willis said. "We want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in our investigation."

As the community grapples with the aftermath of the shooting, one thing is clear: the need for action to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.

"We need to take a hard look at our laws and our culture and make sure that we're doing everything we can to keep our children safe," McDonald said.
