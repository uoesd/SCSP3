East Bay Man's Family Members Killed in Kabul Airport Attack, Highlighting Dangers Faced by Afghan Refugees

SAN LEANDRO, Calif. (KGO) – Qiamuddin Safi, an East Bay man who recently escaped Afghanistan, is mourning the loss of his family members who were victims of the deadly Kabul airport attack. Safi's cousin, a longtime interpreter for the U.S. Army, was killed in one of the blasts at Abbey Gate, while his brother and another cousin are in the ICU, and two other cousins are hospitalized.

"I'm feeling so sad and hopeless," Safi said in an interview with KGO-TV. "My family worked for the U.S. government, making them Taliban targets. Despite having Special Immigration Visas (SIV), we were not safe."

The attack has added to the heartache and fear within the Afghan community in the United States. Community leaders and organizations are rallying to support Afghan refugees and bring attention to human rights violations in Afghanistan.

"The tragic events amplify the confusion and grief among those trying to help their families escape Afghanistan," said Harris Mojadedi, with the Afghan Coalition. "We need to do more to support these families and ensure their safety."
