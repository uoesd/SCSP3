Justice Department's Refusal to Defend Mo Brooks in Capitol Attack Lawsuit Impacts Trump's Defense

WASHINGTON, July 29 – In a move that could have implications for former President Donald Trump's defense, the U.S. Justice Department has refused to defend Rep. Morris "Mo" Brooks in a lawsuit accusing him of inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. The department's decision suggests that inciting an attack on Congress is beyond the scope of employment for federal employees, including Representatives.

The lawsuit, filed by Rep. Eric Swalwell, alleges that Brooks and Trump incited the Capitol riot to prevent Joe Biden's election certification. Trump and Brooks are co-defendants in the case. The Justice Department's decision not to defend Brooks implies that Trump may not be able to rely on the Westfall Act, which provides immunity for federal employees acting within the scope of their employment, for actions related to the Capitol riot.

"The Justice Department's decision sends a clear message to Trump that he won't get immunity under the Westfall Act for his actions on January 6," said Anne Tindall, an attorney with Protect Democracy. "This is a significant development in the case and suggests that the department is taking a tougher stance against Trump."

Trump's primary defense does not rely on the Westfall Act but on presidential immunity. However, legal experts believe that his case is weaker than Brooks', as Trump had no official role in the election certification process.

"The fact that the Justice Department refused to defend Brooks indicates that they don't think his actions were within the scope of his employment," said Donald Ayer, a senior Justice Department official. "This could have implications for Trump's defense, as it suggests that the department may not view his actions as within the scope of his employment either."

Jesse Binnall, Trump's attorney, declined to comment on the Justice Department's decision.

The Justice Department's recent actions have caused concern among some Democrats, but they are seen as protecting the office of the presidency, not Trump personally. The department's decision not to defend Brooks may indicate a tougher stance against Trump, with legal experts suggesting it's bad news for him.

Brooks' attempt to use the Westfall Act for immunity was rejected, indicating that Trump might face similar challenges. "The Justice Department's decision on Brooks suggests that they may take a similar approach with Trump," said Tindall. "This could make it difficult for Trump to argue that his actions were within the scope of his employment."

Trump is also facing two other lawsuits related to his actions on and before Jan. 6. One lawsuit, filed by a group of Democratic lawmakers, alleges that Trump violated the Ku Klux Klan Act by inciting violence against them. The other lawsuit, filed by a Capitol Police officer, alleges that Trump's actions caused him emotional distress.

The Justice Department's decision not to defend Brooks may have implications for Trump's defense in these lawsuits as well. "The department's decision suggests that they may not view Trump's actions as within the scope of his employment, which could impact his defense in the other lawsuits," said Ayer.

Trump has not yet sought Justice Department protection, and it's unclear whether he will do so in the future. However, the department's recent actions suggest that they may take a tougher stance against him, with legal experts believing that his case is weaker than Brooks'.

In conclusion, the Justice Department's refusal to defend Mo Brooks in the Capitol attack lawsuit has implications for Trump's defense. The department's decision suggests that inciting an attack on Congress is beyond the scope of employment for federal employees, including Representatives. Trump's primary defense does not rely on the Westfall Act, but on presidential immunity. However, legal experts believe that his case is weaker than Brooks', as Trump had no official role in the election certification process. The Justice Department's recent actions have caused concern among some Democrats, but they are seen as protecting the office of the presidency, not Trump personally. The department's decision not to defend Brooks may indicate a tougher stance against Trump, with legal experts suggesting it's bad news for him.
