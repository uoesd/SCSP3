Trump Supporter's Death in Capitol Riot Sparks Calls for President's Removal

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The death of a Trump supporter during the U.S. Capitol assault has sparked renewed calls for the president's removal, with the victim's brother-in-law placing blame squarely on Trump's shoulders.

Rosanne Boyland, a 34-year-old from Georgia, died during the chaotic scenes at the Capitol on Wednesday, when a group of Trump supporters stormed the building in an attempt to overturn the election results. Her cause of death has not been officially disclosed, but a friend reported that she was trampled in the crowd.

Justin Cave, Boyland's brother-in-law, was unequivocal in his assessment of who was responsible for her death. "It's all on Trump," he told Reuters. "He's the one who told them to come up here, to fight. He's the one who told them that the election was stolen. He's the one who told them to take back their country. And now my sister-in-law is dead because of it."

Boyland was one of four civilians who died during the riot, which also claimed the life of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick. Ashli Babbitt was shot by Capitol Police, and two men died from medical emergencies.

The violence at the Capitol has sparked a wave of outrage and calls for Trump's removal from office. Democratic leaders have been vocal in their demands for the president's impeachment or removal through the 25th Amendment, which allows for the vice president to take over if the president is deemed unfit for office.

A White House spokesman did not comment on Boyland's death, but Trump himself has faced criticism for his role in inciting the violence. In the days leading up to the riot, he encouraged his supporters to come to Washington and "fight" at the Capitol, using language that many saw as a call to violence.

Justin Winchell, a friend of Boyland's, described her as a passionate Trump supporter who had been excited to attend the rally. "She was a strong Trump supporter, and she wanted to be there to show her support," he said. "She didn't deserve to die like this."

Boyland's death has only added to the growing chorus of voices calling for Trump's removal. "The president's actions have led to the deaths of four people, including a police officer," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. "It's time for him to be held accountable."

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed Pelosi's sentiments, saying that Trump's actions had "crossed a line" and that he should be removed from office.

The calls for Trump's removal are not limited to Democratic leaders. Some Republicans have also spoken out against the president's actions, with Senator Lisa Murkowski saying that she was "struggling" with whether to support Trump's impeachment.

As the fallout from the Capitol riot continues, it remains to be seen whether Trump will face consequences for his role in the violence. But for Justin Cave, the loss of his sister-in-law is a tragedy that he lays squarely at the president's feet. "He's the one who did this," he said. "He's the one who took my sister-in-law away from us."
