CNN Fires Anchor Chris Cuomo Amid Investigation into Brother's Sexual Harassment Allegations

NEW YORK (AP) – CNN has fired anchor Chris Cuomo amid an investigation into his involvement in his brother's defense strategies amid sexual harassment allegations.

Cuomo, who had been suspended from the network since August, was informed of the decision by CNN chief Jeff Zucker in an email to staff. Zucker emphasized the complexity of such decisions, saying, "It is not a decision that was made lightly."

In a Twitter statement, Cuomo expressed disappointment but pride in his team's work. "I am proud of the team at Cuomo Prime Time and the work we did together," he said.

The investigation into Cuomo's conduct will continue "as appropriate," according to CNN. The network had been under scrutiny for months over Cuomo's conduct even before his firing.

Cuomo had been accused of groping a female colleague 16 years ago, to which he has previously apologized. He had also been accused of seeking information on accusers and assisting in crafting responses to allegations against his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

The firing leaves a notable gap in CNN's prime-time lineup. Cuomo had been a prominent figure on the network, hosting the 9 p.m. ET hour of "Cuomo Prime Time" since 2018.

CNN hired an unidentified law firm to review Chris Cuomo's conduct, which recommended his termination. The network had been facing criticism for its handling of the situation, with some calling for Cuomo's firing.

Zucker informed Cuomo of the decision in an email, saying, "I want to assure you that we took this decision very seriously, and it was not made lightly."

Cuomo's firing comes as CNN continues to face scrutiny over its handling of sexual harassment allegations. In 2018, the network fired political commentator Marc Lamont Hill after he made comments criticized as anti-Semitic.

The firing also raises questions about the future of CNN's prime-time lineup. The network has not yet announced a replacement for Cuomo's show, leaving a significant gap in its programming.

In a statement, CNN said, "Chris Cuomo is no longer with CNN. We appreciate his contributions to the network and wish him well in his future endeavors."

The investigation into Cuomo's conduct is ongoing, and it remains to be seen how the network will address the allegations against him. For now, CNN is moving forward without one of its most prominent anchors.
