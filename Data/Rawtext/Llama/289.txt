WHO Grants Emergency Use Listing to Sinopharm COVID-19 Vaccine

Geneva, Switzerland - The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, making it the sixth vaccine to receive this designation. The vaccine, produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, a subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG), has been assessed for safety, efficacy, and quality and found to meet the criteria for emergency use.

"The listing of the Sinopharm vaccine is a significant step towards ensuring that people around the world have access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines," said Dr. Mariângela Simão, Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products, WHO. "We urge Sinopharm to participate in the COVAX Facility, which aims to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, especially to low- and middle-income countries."

The WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) allows for expedited regulatory approval in various countries, enabling the vaccine to be quickly deployed to areas where it is needed most. The EUL procedure assesses novel health products during emergencies, focusing on safety, efficacy, and quality.

The Sinopharm vaccine's assessment included on-site inspections of the production facility, and the vaccine has been found to be suitable for adults 18 years and older, with a two-dose schedule. No upper age limit is recommended for the vaccine, as it is likely to be effective in older adults. However, WHO recommends monitoring safety and effectiveness in older age groups using the vaccine.

Other vaccines listed for emergency use by WHO include Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Janssen, and Moderna. The Sinopharm vaccine is the first vaccine produced by a Chinese company to receive emergency use listing from WHO.

"The listing of the Sinopharm vaccine is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the scientists and manufacturers who have worked tirelessly to develop a vaccine against COVID-19," said Dr. Simão. "We look forward to continuing to work with Sinopharm and other manufacturers to ensure that all people have access to safe and effective vaccines."

The COVAX Facility, led by WHO, Gavi, and CEPI, aims to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, especially to low- and middle-income countries. The facility has secured agreements with several vaccine manufacturers, including Sinopharm, to supply vaccines to participating countries.

"We urge all countries to support the COVAX Facility and to work together to ensure that all people have access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines," said Dr. Simão. "Together, we can end the pandemic and protect the health of all people."

The WHO will continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the Sinopharm vaccine and other COVID-19 vaccines, and will provide updates as new information becomes available.
