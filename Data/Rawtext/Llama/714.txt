Special Locks Installed at Oxford High School Four Years Ago Likely Saved Lives During Shooting Spree

In the aftermath of the shooting spree at Oxford High School last week, it has become clear that the special lockdown locks installed at the school four years ago likely saved lives. The locks, designed by Nightlock in Mt. Morris, Michigan, have been sold to approximately 10,000 school districts nationwide, and have proven to be an effective security measure in preventing unauthorized entry during emergency situations.

The locking device features a red handle that can be inserted into the door from a wall-mounted box, preventing entry. The locks are designed to keep doors secured even if the glass is broken and someone tries to unlock the door from the outside. Oxford High School installed a variety of these locks in 2017, suitable for both inward and outward swinging doors.

According to Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard, the alleged shooter did not enter any classrooms, with all casualties occurring in the hallways. While the shooting was a tragic reminder of the need for enhanced security measures in schools, the effectiveness of the Nightlock locks in preventing the shooter from entering classrooms cannot be ignored.

Sheriff Bouchard acknowledged Oxford Community Schools' safety precautions and training protocols, stating that the district had taken proactive steps to prepare for potential emergencies. Cris Ahearn, Director of Sales at Nightlock, expressed emotional distress over the incident, highlighting the limitations of locking devices in protecting individuals in hallways.

Despite the devastating circumstances, Nightlock has experienced increased inquiries from districts seeking to enhance facility security following the shooting. Ahearn noted that the company's creation was initially inspired by a home invasion at the owners' parents' house, leading to the development of school security devices after the Sandy Hook shooting.

The shooting at Oxford High School serves as a stark reminder of the need for enhanced security measures in schools. While the Nightlock locks proved to be effective in preventing unauthorized entry, it is clear that more needs to be done to protect students and staff in hallways and other areas of the school.

In the wake of this tragedy, it is crucial that schools and districts take a closer look at their security protocols and consider implementing additional measures to prevent future incidents. The safety of students and staff must remain a top priority, and the use of innovative security devices like the Nightlock locks can play a vital role in ensuring a safer learning environment.

As the community of Oxford continues to heal and recover from this tragic event, it is important to recognize the role that the Nightlock locks played in saving lives. While no security measure can guarantee complete safety, the effectiveness of these locks serves as a testament to the importance of proactive security measures in schools.

In the face of such senseless violence, it is crucial that we come together to support those affected and work towards a safer future for all. The use of security devices like the Nightlock locks is a step in the right direction, and it is our hope that their use will become widespread in schools across the nation.

In conclusion, the shooting at Oxford High School highlights the need for enhanced security measures in schools. While the Nightlock locks proved to be effective in preventing unauthorized entry, it is clear that more needs to be done to protect students and staff in hallways and other areas of the school. We must continue to work towards a safer future for all, and the use of innovative security devices like the Nightlock locks is a step in the right direction.
