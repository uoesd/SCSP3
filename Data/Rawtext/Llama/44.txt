Trump Impeached for Second Time, Faces Senate Trial

WASHINGTON (AP) – President Donald Trump was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives for a second time on Wednesday, charged with "incitement of insurrection" after a mob stormed the Capitol building, interrupting the certification of election results. The House voted 232-197 to impeach, with ten Republicans joining Democrats in the most bipartisan presidential impeachment in modern times.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, citing a "clear and present danger" posed by Trump, urged lawmakers to uphold their constitutional duties and impeach the president. "The president's actions have gravely endangered the security and institutions of our democracy," Pelosi said. "He must be held accountable."

In response to the impeachment, Trump released a video statement calling for unity and condemning the violence, without mentioning the impeachment. "We must come together as a nation and move forward in peace and unity," Trump said.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that Trump committed impeachable offenses but has not decided how he will vote in a potential Senate trial. "The president's behavior was inexcusable, but I'm not prepared to say that it rises to the level of impeachment," McConnell said.

The earliest the Senate could start an impeachment trial is the day before Trump's term ends, aiming also to prevent him from running again. The impeachment resolution relies on Trump's incendiary rhetoric and falsehoods about the election outcome.

Security was tightened at the Capitol, including metal-detector screenings for House members, reflecting heightened concerns. The impeachment proceeding drew on historical precedents, including the impeachment of War Secretary William Belknap in 1876 after his resignation.

House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy criticized the impeachment as a "rushed and partisan" process. "This impeachment is not about the president's actions, but about the left's desire to undo the 2016 election," McCarthy said.

Third-ranking House GOP leader Liz Cheney called the impeachment a "sham process" and accused Democrats of "trying to overturn the will of the American people."

Representative Jim McGovern (D-Mass) countered that the impeachment was necessary to protect democracy. "We are here today because the president of the United States has violated his oath of office and threatened the very foundations of our democracy," McGovern said.

Representative Jason Crow (D-Colo) echoed McGovern's sentiments. "The president's actions are a direct attack on the rule of law and our democratic institutions," Crow said. "We must hold him accountable."

Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif) called for Trump's removal from office. "This president is a danger to our democracy and must be impeached and removed," Waters said.

Representative Tom McClintock (R-Calif) argued that the impeachment was a political ploy. "This impeachment is not about the president's actions, but about the left's desire to gain political advantage," McClintock said.

Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pennsylvania) expressed concerns about the impeachment process. "I'm concerned about the precedent this impeachment sets for future presidents," Toomey said. "We must be careful not to weaken the presidency."

Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) called for a bipartisan approach to the impeachment. "I urge my colleagues to approach this impeachment with a sense of fairness and bipartisanship," Murkowski said. "We must put aside our differences and do what is best for the country."
