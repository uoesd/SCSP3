Michigan Wins Big Ten Championship, Honors Oxford High School Shooting Victim Tate Myre

Indianapolis – The Michigan Wolverines secured their first Big Ten championship in 17 years with a dominating 42-3 victory over Iowa in the Big Ten Championship Game on Saturday. The victory not only marked a significant milestone for the team but also secured their spot in the College Football Playoff for the first time.

The game was played at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, where the Wolverines wore a patch on their jerseys to honor the victims of the Oxford High School shooting, including Tate Myre, who was number 42 on his high school football team. Myre was one of four students killed in the mass shooting at Oxford High School.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh described Myre as a hero, saying that he died trying to stop the shooter. Myre's family participated in the pregame coin toss, wearing 'Oxford Strong' T-shirts.

Senior defensive end Aidan Hutchinson suggested dedicating the game to Tate Myre, and his teammates and coaches saw the final score of 42 points as a tribute to Myre's jersey number. Hutchinson was named the game's most valuable player.

"It's an incredible feeling, especially with everything that's happened this week," Hutchinson said. "We wanted to play for Tate and the Oxford community. We wanted to make them proud."

Center Andrew Vastardis added, "We knew we had to come out and play for Tate and the Oxford community. We wanted to give them something to cheer for."

The Wolverines dominated the game from start to finish, with quarterback Shea Patterson throwing for 337 yards and three touchdowns. Running back Zach Charbonnet rushed for 122 yards and two touchdowns.

The victory marked a significant turnaround for the Wolverines, who finished last season with a 7-6 record. Harbaugh credited the team's hard work and dedication for their success.

"I'm so proud of these players and coaches," Harbaugh said. "They've worked so hard and have been through so much. This is a special moment for all of us."

The Wolverines will now move on to the College Football Playoff, where they will face off against the Alabama Crimson Tide in the Citrus Bowl on New Year's Day.

Despite the excitement of the game, the Wolverines' victory was bittersweet, as it was overshadowed by the tragedy at Oxford High School. Myre's death has left a lasting impact on the community, and the Wolverines wanted to do their part to honor his memory.

"We wanted to play for Tate and the Oxford community," Hutchinson said. "We wanted to make them proud."

The Wolverines' victory was a testament to the strength and resilience of the Oxford community, and they will carry Myre's memory with them as they move forward in the playoffs.

"This game was for Tate and the Oxford community," Vastardis said. "We wanted to give them something to cheer for, and we hope we made them proud."
