Deadly Kabul Airport Attack Marks Worst Single-Day Loss for US Troops in Afghanistan Since 2011

At least 13 US soldiers were among 85 people killed in explosions at Kabul airport, claimed by ISIS-K, marking the worst single-day loss for American troops in Afghanistan since August 2011. The attack on August 26, 2021, was one of the deadliest days for US troops in Afghanistan since the start of the war in 2002.

The attack on the Kabul airport was a grim reminder of the ongoing violence in Afghanistan, where the US and its allies have been fighting the Taliban and other extremist groups for nearly two decades. The US has lost more than 2,400 troops in Afghanistan since the start of the war, with many more injured.

The deadliest day for US troops in Afghanistan was August 6, 2011, when a helicopter was shot down, killing 30 American troops. Other deadly incidents include May 26, 2011, when seven US troops were killed by a bomb explosion, and April 19, 2011, when eight US airmen and one civilian were killed by an Afghan officer.

The attack on the Kabul airport was claimed by ISIS-K, a branch of the Islamic State group that has been active in Afghanistan since 2014. The group has been responsible for several high-profile attacks in the country, including a suicide bombing on December 21, 2015, that killed six American troops.

The US has been steadily reducing its troop presence in Afghanistan in recent years, with plans to withdraw all troops by the end of 2021. However, the recent attack on the Kabul airport has raised questions about the safety of US troops in the country and the ability of the Afghan government to protect them.

The attack on the Kabul airport was widely condemned by leaders around the world, including US President Joe Biden, who vowed to continue supporting the Afghan government in its fight against extremist groups. The attack also highlighted the ongoing challenges facing the US and its allies in Afghanistan, where the Taliban and other extremist groups continue to pose a significant threat to stability and security.

The US has been involved in Afghanistan since 2002, when it launched a military operation against the Taliban and al-Qaeda following the 9/11 attacks. Since then, the US has spent billions of dollars on military operations and reconstruction efforts in the country, with mixed results.

Despite the ongoing violence, the US and its allies have made progress in recent years in defeating the Taliban and improving security in Afghanistan. However, the recent attack on the Kabul airport highlights the ongoing challenges facing the US and its allies in the country.

The attack on the Kabul airport was a sobering reminder of the dangers facing US troops in Afghanistan, where the conflict has been ongoing for nearly two decades. The US and its allies have vowed to continue supporting the Afghan government in its fight against extremist groups, but the recent attack has raised questions about the safety of US troops in the country and the ability of the Afghan government to protect them.
