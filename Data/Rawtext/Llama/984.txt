Trump Launches TRUTH Social, Takes Aim at Big Tech

In a move that could shake up the social media landscape, former US President Donald Trump has announced the launch of his own platform, TRUTH Social. The announcement comes nine months after Trump was banned from major social media sites for his alleged role in inciting violence at the US Capitol.

TRUTH Social is part of Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), a company founded by the former president to challenge the dominance of Big Tech. According to Trump, the platform aims to offer a voice to those silenced by the likes of Twitter, Facebook, and Google.

"For too long, Big Tech has suppressed conservative voices and silenced the truth," Trump said in a statement. "TRUTH Social will be a platform where people can express themselves freely, without fear of retribution or censorship."

The preliminary rollout of TRUTH Social is scheduled for November, with a full rollout planned for the first quarter of 2022. The platform promises to offer a range of features, including a news feed, groups, and messaging.

Beyond social media, TMTG plans to launch a subscription video-on-demand service, TMTG+, and enter the cloud-computing space. The company aims to challenge the dominance of Big Tech in multiple areas, including online streaming and cloud computing.

Trump has been a vocal critic of Big Tech, accusing platforms like Twitter of hosting accounts for the Taliban while suspending his own accounts. He was impeached for his alleged role in the January 6 Capitol riots but was acquitted by the Senate.

The launch of TRUTH Social comes after an initial attempt at a blog on his website was abandoned due to low traffic. Trump also sued Facebook, Twitter, and Google in July, seeking account restoration and punitive damages.

The move into social media could be seen as a way for Trump to regain his online presence and influence, which was significantly diminished after his ban from major platforms. However, it remains to be seen how TRUTH Social will fare in a crowded social media landscape dominated by established players like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Some have raised concerns about the potential for TRUTH Social to become a platform for spreading misinformation and hate speech. However, TMTG has stated that it will have strict moderation policies in place to prevent such behavior.

The launch of TRUTH Social has sparked mixed reactions, with some conservatives hailing it as a much-needed alternative to Big Tech, while others have expressed concerns about the potential for the platform to be used to spread hate speech and misinformation.

Regardless of how TRUTH Social fares, it is clear that the launch of the platform marks a significant moment in the ongoing battle between Big Tech and conservative voices. The move could potentially pave the way for other conservative leaders and influencers to launch their own platforms, challenging the dominance of Big Tech in the social media landscape.

In conclusion, the launch of TRUTH Social represents a bold move by Donald Trump to challenge the dominance of Big Tech and offer a platform for conservative voices. While it remains to be seen how the platform will fare, it is clear that the move marks a significant moment in the ongoing battle between Big Tech and conservative voices.
