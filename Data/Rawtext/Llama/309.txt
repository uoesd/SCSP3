Ever Given Container Ship Resumes Journey After 106 Days in Suez Canal

ISMAILIA, Egypt, July 7 (Reuters) – The Ever Given container ship, which had been stuck in the Suez Canal for 106 days, finally resumed its journey on Wednesday, heading north across the Great Bitter Lake. The ship's release came after a compensation settlement was signed between the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) and the ship's representatives.

The Ever Given, loaded with about 18,300 containers, was due for a hull inspection before sailing to its next port. The ship had been held under court order while the SCA sought compensation from its owner and insurers.

According to Khalid Abubakr, a lawyer for the Suez Canal Authority, an undisclosed settlement was reached between the parties, with some compensation to be paid this month. The SCA aims to keep the terms of the agreement confidential.

The incident has had a significant impact on global trade, as the Suez Canal is a vital waterway that carries about 15% of world shipping traffic. The Ever Given's prolonged stay in the canal has caused delays and disruptions to shipping schedules, leading to a push to widen and deepen the southernmost section of the canal and extend a second lane.

Tarek Alzeki, captain of a tug boat that assisted in the refloating of the Ever Given, expressed his relief at the ship's release. "It's a big relief for us, for the canal, and for the whole world," he said. "We are happy that the ship is moving again."

R P Veetil, General Secretary of the Sailors Union of India, also welcomed the news. "We are glad that the ship has been released, and we hope that it will reach its destination safely," he said.

Yukito Higaki, a spokesperson for Imabari shipbuilding, a subsidiary of Shoei Kisen, the ship's owner, confirmed that the ship had resumed its journey. "We are grateful that the ship has been released, and we will continue to cooperate with the Suez Canal Authority to ensure its safe passage," he said.

Guy Platten, Secretary General of the International Chamber of Shipping, emphasized the importance of the Suez Canal to global trade. "The Suez Canal is a vital artery for global trade, and the incident with the Ever Given has highlighted the need for its continued maintenance and improvement," he said.

Osama Rabie, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, expressed his satisfaction at the resolution of the incident. "We are pleased that the ship has been released, and we will continue to work to ensure the safe and efficient passage of ships through the canal," he said.

The Ever Given's journey is not without challenges, as it must navigate through the narrow and shallow sections of the canal. However, with the help of tug boats and careful navigation, the ship is expected to reach its next port safely.

The incident has also raised questions about the rules for ships transiting the canal in difficult weather conditions. However, according to Abubakr, the SCA has no plans to change the rules. "The rules are in place to ensure the safe passage of ships, and we will continue to enforce them," he said.

As the Ever Given continues its journey, the shipping industry is breathing a sigh of relief. The incident has highlighted the importance of the Suez Canal to global trade and the need for its continued maintenance and improvement. With the ship's release, the industry can now focus on ensuring the safe and efficient passage of ships through the canal.
