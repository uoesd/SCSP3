Facebook, YouTube Remove Bolsonaro Video Linking COVID-19 Vaccines to AIDS

RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 25 – Facebook and YouTube have removed a video by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro claiming that COVID-19 vaccines are linked to AIDS, citing violations of their policies against COVID-19 disinformation.

According to a Facebook spokesperson, the video was removed for violating the platform's policy that prohibits claims that COVID-19 vaccines kill or seriously harm people. YouTube also removed the video, stating that it violated their policy against allegations that vaccines do not reduce the risk of contracting the disease and cause other infectious diseases.

UNAIDS has stated that COVID-19 vaccines are safe, including for those living with HIV. However, Bolsonaro has been a vocal skeptic of COVID-19 vaccines, previously promoting ineffective treatments such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. He has also credited hydroxychloroquine for his mild COVID-19 symptoms but initially refused to take any COVID-19 vaccine.

Bolsonaro's office has not responded to requests for comment on the video's removal. YouTube has reportedly suspended Bolsonaro for seven days following the video's removal, but both Facebook and YouTube have not provided further comments on the suspension.

This is not the first time that YouTube has removed videos by Bolsonaro for promoting misinformation about COVID-19. In the past, YouTube has removed videos by Bolsonaro promoting hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin as treatments for COVID-19, citing violations of their policies against COVID-19 disinformation.

Facebook and YouTube have been under pressure to crack down on misinformation about COVID-19, particularly in Brazil, where the pandemic has had a devastating impact. The country has recorded over 21 million cases and over 600,000 deaths from COVID-19, making it one of the hardest-hit countries in the world.

The removal of Bolsonaro's video is seen as a sign that social media platforms are taking steps to address the spread of misinformation about COVID-19. However, some critics argue that more needs to be done to hold public figures accountable for spreading false information about the pandemic.

In a statement, a YouTube spokesperson said, "We have strict policies against COVID-19 misinformation and will continue to enforce them to protect the health and safety of our users."

The removal of Bolsonaro's video has sparked a heated debate in Brazil, with some defending his right to free speech and others praising the move as a necessary step to combat misinformation.

Despite the controversy, it is clear that social media platforms have a responsibility to protect their users from false information that can have serious consequences for public health. The removal of Bolsonaro's video is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to address the spread of misinformation about COVID-19.
