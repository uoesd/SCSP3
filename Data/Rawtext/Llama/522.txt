Hurricane Ida Claims First Life in Louisiana, Leaves Trail of Destruction

Gonzales, Louisiana – Hurricane Ida, which made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 3 storm, has claimed its first life in the state. Dennis Duplessis, a 58-year-old resident of Gonzales, was killed when a falling oak tree severed an artery in his leg as he attempted to step out of a truck.

According to his nephew, Caleb Marcantel, Duplessis was trying to leave his truck to assess the damage caused by the storm when the tree fell on him. Despite efforts by his family and emergency responders to save him, Duplessis died before medical help could arrive.

"It was a freak accident," Marcantel said. "He was just trying to get out of the truck and see what was going on, and the tree fell on him. It's just a tragic loss."

Duplessis' death marks the first confirmed fatality from Hurricane Ida, which has caused widespread destruction and claimed dozens of lives across the region. The storm maintained significant strength as it moved inland, remaining a Category 3 hurricane when it reached Gonzales.

In addition to the devastating loss of life, Hurricane Ida has also left a trail of destruction in its wake. Historic sites, including the Whitney Plantation in Edgard, have been badly damaged. The plantation, which is significant as a historic museum focusing on the experience of enslaved Africans, saw a church built by freed slaves and a century-old barn destroyed.

"It's heartbreaking to see such an important piece of our history destroyed," said Joy Banner, communications director for the Whitney Plantation and a descendant of enslaved Africans. "But we will rebuild and continue to tell the stories of those who came before us."

Volunteers from nearby churches have been working to clear the fallen tree from Duplessis' front yard, and a company has safely removed another large tree near the residence free of charge, relieving the family's worry.

Chasity Fatherree, Duplessis' daughter, expressed her gratitude for the support her family has received. "It's been a difficult time, but we're grateful for the help and support of our community," she said.

Crystal Marcantel, a nurse and sister-in-law to Caleb Marcantel, was among those who rushed to the scene to try and save Duplessis. "It was a chaotic scene, but we did everything we could to try and save him," she said.

As the community comes to terms with the loss of Duplessis, they are also working to rebuild and recover from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida. The storm's impact will be felt for a long time, but the resilience and determination of those affected will help them overcome the challenges ahead.

Correction: In an earlier version of this story, Crystal Marcantel was incorrectly identified as Caleb Marcantel's wife. She is actually his sister-in-law.
