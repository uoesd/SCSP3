Brian Laundrie Named 'Person of Interest' in Gabby Petito's Disappearance, Nationwide Manhunt Continues

NORTH PORT, Fla. – The investigation into the disappearance of Gabby Petito has taken a new turn, with Brian Laundrie, her boyfriend, being named a "person of interest" in the case. Laundrie, who returned home on September 1 without Petito, has been the focus of intense scrutiny as the search for Petito continues.

According to Steven Bertolino, the attorney for the Laundrie family, Brian Laundrie flew to Florida from Salt Lake City on August 17 and returned six days later during a road trip with Petito. The purpose of the flight, Bertolino stated, was to save money for extending their road trip.

However, Laundrie's return home without Petito has raised suspicions, and he has been named a "person of interest" in her disappearance. Petito, who went missing during the trip, was confirmed dead, found in Bridger-Teton National Forest, Wyoming.

Cassie Laundrie, Brian's sister, has pleaded for him to surrender to police, claiming no knowledge of his whereabouts. In an interview, Cassie described her last interaction with Brian, which took place on September 6 during a family visit, as "ordinary."

New Moab Police body camera footage released shows an interaction between police, Petito, and Laundrie on August 12. In the footage, Petito describes Laundrie grabbing and scratching her face, acknowledging that she hit him first. The couple was stopped by Moab, Utah police after a witness reported a domestic violence incident.

The intensifying case has sparked a nationwide manhunt for Brian Laundrie, with law enforcement agencies working tirelessly to locate him. The public has also played a significant role in the search, with many sharing information and tips on social media.

As the investigation continues, many questions remain unanswered. What happened to Gabby Petito during her trip with Brian Laundrie? Where is Brian Laundrie now? And what role, if any, did he play in Petito's disappearance and death?

The case has captured the attention of the nation, with many following the developments closely. The Laundrie family has remained tight-lipped, with their attorney, Steven Bertolino, releasing statements on their behalf.

In a recent statement, Bertolino expressed the family's condolences to the Petito family, stating, "The Laundrie family is heartbroken over the tragic loss of Gabby Petito. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Petito family during this difficult time."

As the search for Brian Laundrie continues, the public is urged to remain vigilant and report any sightings to the authorities immediately. With the release of the new body camera footage, the case has taken a new turn, and the public's help is crucial in bringing closure to the Petito family.
