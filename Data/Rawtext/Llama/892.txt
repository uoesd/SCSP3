Tom Brady Opens Up About His Reservations During Super Bowl LV Victory Parade

In a recent interview with Good Morning America co-host Michael Strahan, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady expressed some reservations about his decision to toss the Lombardi Trophy during the Super Bowl LV victory parade. The incident occurred during a waterway parade on the Hillsborough River in Tampa, Florida, after the Buccaneers won the Super Bowl in 2021.

"I was a little hesitant at first, I'm not gonna lie," Brady admitted. "I didn't want to drop the trophy, and I was worried about the sharp edges posing a risk to people nearby."

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers opted for a boat parade instead of a traditional parade due to COVID-19 precautions. Brady mentioned having fun during the celebration but acknowledged he is not comfortable with public attention and prefers staying home.

"I'm a pretty private person, so being in the public eye all the time can be challenging," Brady said. "But it's part of the job, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to play the game I love."

Brady credited his wife, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, for the strength of their marriage and for making many sacrifices. The couple shares two children, Benjamin Rein (11) and Vivian Lake (8). Brady also has a 13-year-old son, John Edward, with ex Bridget Moynahan.

"Gisele has been an incredible partner and support system for me," Brady said. "She's made many sacrifices for our family, and I'm grateful for everything she does."

Brady emphasized the importance of keeping his children grounded and making sure they understand the need to work hard.

"My kids are growing up in a unique environment, and it's important to me that they understand the value of hard work and making their own impact in the world," Brady said. "I want them to be good people, and that's what matters most to me."

Bündchen shared her own thoughts on the matter, stating, "I think it's important for our children to see us working hard and pursuing our passions. It's important for them to understand that success doesn't come easily, and that it takes dedication and perseverance."

In conclusion, Tom Brady's reservations during the Super Bowl LV victory parade are understandable, given his private nature and concerns for safety. However, his commitment to his family and his desire to instill good values in his children are admirable. As one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, Brady continues to make a positive impact both on and off the field.
