Tiger Woods Survives Severe Car Crash in Los Angeles, Credits Seatbelt for Survival

Golfing legend Tiger Woods is counting his blessings after surviving a severe car crash in Los Angeles, California. The 45-year-old athlete was involved in a single-vehicle accident on Tuesday, which left his SUV badly damaged and him with serious injuries.

According to Deputy Carlos Gonzalez of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Woods' vehicle hit a median and rolled approximately 100 feet off the road. "Tiger Woods was calm, lucid, and wearing his seatbelt at the scene," Gonzalez reported.

Woods was rushed to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he underwent surgery for serious injuries to both legs. Sheriff Alex Villanueva stated that there was no evidence of impairment at the crash scene, and no attempt was made to draw blood at the hospital to test for impairment.

An investigation into the crash's causes is currently underway, with findings expected to be released in the coming days or weeks. In the meantime, sporting figures and even former President Donald Trump have taken to social media to send their prayers and thoughts to Woods.

The PGA legend's survival is being attributed to his use of a seatbelt during the incident. "It's a miracle he's alive," said Villanueva. "The seatbelt definitely saved his life."

A minor second crash occurred when another driver stopped to help Woods, but no one was injured.

Woods, who has won 15 major championships and has been named PGA Player of the Year a record 11 times, is widely regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time. His accident has sent shockwaves through the sports world, with fans and fellow athletes alike expressing their relief and support for his recovery.

As the investigation continues, the golfing community remains hopeful for Woods' speedy recovery and return to the green.
