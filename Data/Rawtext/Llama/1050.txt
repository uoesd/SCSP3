Gabby Petito's Body Found in Wyoming, FBI Names Brian Laundrie as Person of Interest

The body of 22-year-old Gabby Petito, who was reported missing earlier this month, has been found in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. The Teton County Coroner, Brent Blue, performed an autopsy and ruled the manner of death as homicide, pending final autopsy results.

"We are heartbroken to confirm that the body found in Grand Teton National Park is that of Gabby Petito," said FBI Denver spokesperson. "Our thoughts are with her family and friends during this difficult time."

The FBI has completed a forensic search of the campground where Petito's body was found and is asking anyone who was in the area from August 27-30 to contact investigators. They have also named Brian Laundrie, Petito's fiancé, as a person of interest in the case.

"We are committed to holding those responsible for Gabby's death accountable," said FBI Denver spokesperson. "We urge anyone with information about Brian Laundrie's whereabouts to come forward."

Laundrie's whereabouts remain unknown, and investigators are currently searching for him in Florida's Carlton Reserve. Petito's family attorney, Richard Benson Stafford, thanked the press for giving the family time to grieve and indicated that a forthcoming statement will be released.

Petito's last known contact with her family was in late August, and she was reported missing on September 11. According to police reports, the couple had a domestic dispute in Moab, Utah, on August 12, which was classified as a "mental health break."

"Gabby was a beautiful soul, and we are profoundly disappointed in Brian's actions," said a friend of Petito's. "He's a coward, and he needs to be held accountable for what he's done."

The FBI is urging anyone with information about Petito's death or Laundrie's whereabouts to contact them immediately. They have set up a tip line and are encouraging people to share any information they may have, no matter how small.

As the investigation continues, the community has come together to support Petito's family. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help with funeral expenses and other related costs.

"We are grateful for the outpouring of support from the community," said Stafford. "Gabby was a shining light, and her memory will live on through the love and support of those who knew her."

The discovery of Petito's body has sent shockwaves through the community, and many are calling for justice for the young woman. As the investigation unfolds, one thing is clear: those who knew and loved Gabby Petito will not rest until justice is served.

"Gabby was a beautiful person, inside and out," said a friend. "She didn't deserve to meet such a tragic end. We will keep fighting for her until the truth is revealed."

The investigation into Petito's death is ongoing, and the FBI is urging anyone with information to come forward. As the search for Brian Laundrie continues, one thing is certain: the truth will come to light, and justice will be served for Gabby Petito.
