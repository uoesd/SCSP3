Chris Wallace Leaves Fox News After 18 Years, Joins CNN's Streaming Service

In a surprise move, veteran journalist Chris Wallace announced his departure from Fox News during his last broadcast of Fox News Sunday. Wallace, who has been with the network for 18 years, revealed that he is leaving to "try something new" and is excited about joining CNN's planned streaming service.

"I want to try something new, and I'm excited about the opportunity to explore streaming and the flexibility it offers for interviews and storytelling," Wallace said in a statement.

Wallace's departure from Fox News coincides with the expiration of his contract, as reported by Variety. CNN released a statement from Wallace expressing his eagerness to explore streaming and the flexibility it offers for interviews and storytelling.

Fox News praised Wallace's contributions and stated that Fox News Sunday would continue with a rotation of anchors until a permanent host is found. "We are grateful for Chris's contributions to Fox News and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors," the network said in a statement.

Wallace's exit is part of recent high-profile media changes, including Brian Williams leaving NBC and CNN firing Chris Cuomo. However, Wallace's departure from Fox News is not without controversy. He had expressed dissatisfaction with Fox's airing of Tucker Carlson's series 'Patriot Purge', which included conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.

Wallace's colleague, Bret Baier, tweeted celebrating Wallace's legacy at Fox. "Chris Wallace has been a fixture on Fox News Sunday for 18 years, and his departure is a huge loss for the network," Baier said. "He's a tough interviewer and a true professional, and I'm going to miss working with him."

Tucker Carlson and other Fox personalities did not comment on Wallace's departure.

Wallace has a reputation for tough interviewing and has moderated two presidential debates in 2016 and 2020. Despite criticism, Wallace has defended his impartiality, arguing that CNN and MSNBC also have opinion-based programming that pushes a liberal agenda.

"I've always tried to be fair and impartial in my reporting, and I think that's what's made me successful," Wallace said in a recent interview. "I'm not afraid to ask tough questions, but I also try to give my guests the opportunity to respond and make their case."

Wallace's departure from Fox News is a significant loss for the network, but his move to CNN's streaming service is a major coup for the network. With his reputation for tough interviewing and his experience moderating presidential debates, Wallace is sure to be a valuable asset to CNN's lineup.

In a statement, CNN praised Wallace's journalistic skills and expressed excitement about his joining the network. "We are thrilled to have Chris Wallace join our team," CNN said. "His reputation for tough, fair reporting is unmatched, and we look forward to seeing him bring that same level of excellence to our streaming service."

As Wallace embarks on this new chapter in his career, he leaves behind a legacy of tough, fair reporting that has earned him the respect of his colleagues and the public. Whether he will continue to moderate presidential debates remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Chris Wallace is a force to be reckoned with in the world of journalism.
