Alex Padilla Sworn in as California's First Latino Senator, Security Tightened Ahead of Inauguration

Los Angeles, CA - Alex Padilla, a former Los Angeles City Councilman and California secretary of state, was appointed by Governor Gavin Newsom to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Padilla resigned from his position as secretary of state to assume his new role in the Senate, making him the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate.

Kamala Harris formally resigned her Senate seat ahead of her inauguration with President-elect Joe Biden, paving the way for Padilla's appointment. Padilla has a strong background in both local and state government, having served on the Los Angeles City Council and in the California state Senate.

Before his political career, Padilla earned a degree in mechanical engineering and worked for Hughes Aircraft. His experience and expertise will undoubtedly serve him well in his new role as Senator.

As Padilla takes office, security has been increased ahead of Biden's inauguration due to threats against the U.S. Capitol and state capitals. Charles Marino, CEO of Sentinel Security Solutions, discussed the enhanced security measures, stating, "We are taking every precaution to ensure the safety of our elected officials and the public."

Governor Newsom nominated Shirley Weber to succeed Padilla as secretary of state, potentially making her the first Black woman to hold that position. Padilla's deputy, James Schwab, will serve as acting secretary of state until Weber's confirmation.

In a statement, Padilla expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to serve California in the Senate, saying, "I am honored to be the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate. I am committed to fighting for the rights and interests of all Californians, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to address the challenges facing our state and nation."

As Padilla begins his term in the Senate, he will be faced with a number of pressing issues, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the need for economic stimulus. However, with his experience and dedication to public service, he is well-equipped to tackle these challenges and serve the people of California.

In conclusion, the appointment of Alex Padilla to the U.S. Senate is a historic moment for California and a testament to the diversity and representation of the state's residents. As he takes office, Padilla is committed to fighting for the rights and interests of all Californians, and his experience and expertise will undoubtedly serve him well in this new role.
