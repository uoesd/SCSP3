Strengthening Ties: Vice President Harris Welcomes President Akufo-Addo to the White House

It is my great honor to welcome President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana to the White House today. This visit represents a significant milestone in the strong and enduring relationship between our two nations.

The United States and Ghana have enjoyed a long history of diplomatic relations, dating back to 1957. However, our ties run much deeper than that. Many Americans have traveled to Ghana to learn about their ancestry and the history of slavery, forging deep cultural connections between our peoples.

President Akufo-Addo and I share a commitment to democracy, as evidenced by Ghana's free and fair elections. We understand that democracies are strengthened by full participation and weakened when individuals are excluded. That is why we are working together to ensure that all citizens have an equal voice and opportunity to participate in the democratic process.

Our two countries are also committed to global health, and we are proud to be collaborating on this critical issue. The United States has donated over 1.2 million doses of the Moderna vaccine to Ghana, and we plan to send more than 1.3 million Pfizer vaccine doses in the near future. This is a testament to our shared commitment to protecting the health and well-being of our citizens and to addressing global challenges together.

In addition to our work in global health, we are also working to expand our economic relationship. American companies are increasing their presence in Ghana, and we are excited about the potential for future growth and collaboration. I want to commend the Ghanaian government for creating a confidence-inspiring environment through respect for the rule of law and human rights. This has helped to attract investment and promote economic development.

As we look to the future, President Akufo-Addo and I are committed to continuing our collaboration, including in the context of the United Nations Security Council. We share a commitment to promoting peace and security around the world and to addressing the pressing global challenges of our time.

Once again, I want to welcome President Akufo-Addo to the White House and express my gratitude for the strong relationship between our nations. I look forward to our continued partnership and to the many great things that we will achieve together.

Thank you.
