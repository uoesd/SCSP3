Colin Powell, Trailblazing Statesman and Military Leader, Dies at 84

Colin Luther Powell, the first Black U.S. Secretary of State and a towering figure in American military and political history, passed away on October 18, 2022, due to complications from COVID-19. He was 84 years old.

Powell's estimated net worth at the time of his death was $60 million, a testament to his successful career spanning multiple presidencies and various entrepreneurial ventures. He is survived by his wife, Alma Johnson, their daughters Linda and Annemarie, and son Michael.

Born in Harlem, New York, on April 5, 1937, Powell's rise to prominence began with a White House Fellowship in 1972, during the Nixon administration. He went on to serve as National Security Advisor and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, before retiring from the military in 1993.

Powell's legacy extends beyond his impressive military and political achievements. He was a sought-after speaker, earning $7 million from 109 speaking engagements in 2000 alone. He also authored a best-selling autobiography, "My American Journey," which was published in 1995.

Former President George W. Bush, who awarded Powell the Presidential Medal of Freedom twice, praised his service, saying, "Colin Powell was a great leader, a great diplomat, and a great American. He will be deeply missed."

Powell's post-military career was marked by entrepreneurial ventures and service on various boards and campaigns. In 1997, he founded America's Promise Alliance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of young people.

U.S. Representative Jamaal Bowman, who represents New York's 16th Congressional District, reflected on Powell's inspirational legacy, saying, "Colin Powell's passing is a tremendous loss for our nation. He was a trailblazer, a figure of high accomplishment from NYC and City College, who showed us all what was possible with hard work, dedication, and a commitment to public service."

Powell's impact on American history and his contributions to the nation's military and political landscape are undeniable. His legacy will continue to inspire future generations of leaders and public servants.

In a statement, Powell's family expressed their gratitude for the outpouring of support and sympathy they have received, saying, "We have been deeply touched by the outpouring of love and support we have received from friends, family, and colleagues around the world. Colin was a devoted husband, father, and friend, and we will miss him dearly."

As the nation mourns the loss of this extraordinary leader, we are reminded of Powell's own words, "A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work." Colin Powell's life was a testament to the power of those principles, and his legacy will continue to inspire and motivate us for generations to come.
