Senate Confirms Ketanji Brown Jackson to D.C. Circuit, Eyes on Supreme Court

WASHINGTON, June 14 – The U.S. Senate confirmed federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Thursday, with a vote of 53-44. All opposition came from Republicans, while three Republicans joined Democrats in supporting Jackson's nomination.

President Joe Biden nominated Jackson, a historic choice as the first Black woman to serve on the D.C. Circuit, seen as a potential Supreme Court nominee. Jackson replaces Attorney General Merrick Garland on the D.C. Circuit, a common precursor to a Supreme Court appointment.

Jackson, aged 50, was previously appointed to her district court position by former President Barack Obama in 2013. During her confirmation hearing, she refuted the idea that race plays a role in her judicial decisions.

Democrats currently have control of the Senate, which is split 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris available for tie-breaking votes. Liberal activists have urged Stephen Breyer, the Supreme Court's oldest liberal justice, to retire while Democrats hold the Senate.

Jackson, a Harvard Law School graduate, once clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer. She and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger are viewed as front-runners for a Supreme Court nomination if Breyer retires.

Jackson's confirmation is a significant milestone for diversity on the federal bench, as she becomes the first Black woman to serve on the D.C. Circuit. Her appointment also underscores President Biden's commitment to diversifying the judiciary.

In a statement, President Biden praised Jackson's confirmation, saying, "Judge Jackson is a highly qualified and experienced jurist who will bring a unique perspective to the D.C. Circuit. I am confident that she will serve the American people with distinction and integrity."

The confirmation vote was largely along party lines, with three Republicans – Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitt Romney of Utah – joining Democrats in supporting Jackson's nomination.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) hailed Jackson's confirmation as a victory for diversity and inclusion on the federal bench. "Judge Jackson's confirmation is a step forward for equal justice and a more representative judiciary," Schumer said in a statement.

The confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the D.C. Circuit is a significant moment in the Biden administration's efforts to reshape the federal judiciary. Her appointment is a testament to the President's commitment to diversity and inclusivity, and she is poised to play a critical role in shaping the court's decisions for years to come.
