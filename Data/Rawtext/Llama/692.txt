Parents of Oxford High School shooter Ethan Crumbley ignored signs of danger, prosecutors say

CNN – A Michigan prosecutor has accused the parents of Oxford High School shooter Ethan Crumbley of ignoring signs that their son was a threat and failing to prevent the tragic event that left four students dead and seven others injured.

According to Chief Assistant Prosecutor David Williams, James and Jennifer Crumbley face involuntary manslaughter charges and have pleaded not guilty. The prosecution argues that the Crumbleys are flight risks, citing their financial troubles and previous attempt to flee.

"The Crumbleys were consumed with their own lives and neglected their son's well-being," Williams said in a court filing. "They knew about Ethan's depression and fascination with guns but failed to take appropriate action."

The filing alleges that Ethan's troubles were known to his parents, who exhibited disturbing behavior, including being sadder than usual and torturing animals. Despite this, the Crumbleys bought their son a gun, which they allegedly knew he was fascinated with.

The prosecution argues that the Crumbleys should have been more vigilant on the day of the shooting, especially since they had bought Ethan a gun. A drawing made by Ethan on the day of the shooting, showing a gun and a plea for help, underwent "modifications," according to the filing.

School officials had a meeting with the Crumbleys about Ethan's mental state but did not remove him from school, allowing him to attend classes.

Ethan Crumbley, 15, has been charged with terrorism and murder for the shooting. His parents face up to 15 years in prison if convicted of involuntary manslaughter.

The shooting occurred on November 30, 2020, at Oxford High School, located about 30 miles north of Detroit.

The prosecution's case against the Crumbleys centers on their alleged failure to address their son's mental health issues and their decision to buy him a gun despite knowing his fascination with firearms.

"The Crumbleys had a responsibility to protect their son and the community from harm," Williams said. "They failed in that responsibility, and now four innocent lives have been lost."

The case has sparked a national debate about gun control and school safety. Advocates for stricter gun laws argue that the shooting could have been prevented if the Crumbleys had not been able to buy their son a gun.

Others argue that the shooting highlights the need for better mental health resources for students and greater awareness of the warning signs of potential violence.

The Crumbleys' defense team has not commented publicly on the charges against their clients.

The case is expected to go to trial later this year. If convicted, the Crumbleys could face up to 15 years in prison.

The shooting at Oxford High School has left a permanent scar on the community, and the families of the victims are still struggling to come to terms with their loss.

The case serves as a reminder of the importance of addressing mental health issues and the need for greater vigilance in preventing school violence.

As the community continues to heal, the focus remains on ensuring that such a tragedy never happens again.
