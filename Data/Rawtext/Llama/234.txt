Cyber Attack Halts Production at Spain's Damm Brewery

MADRID, Nov 12 – Spain's second-largest beer maker, Damm, has been hit by a cyber attack that forced the company to halt production at its main brewery outside Barcelona. The attack, which occurred on Tuesday night, completely paralyzed the brewery in El Prat de Llobregat for several hours, according to Olga Vidal, the company's head of communications.

The brewery, which produces 7 million hectolitres of beer a year, was able to partially resume production with IT intervention. However, Vidal did not disclose if a ransom was demanded or paid to the hackers. The company's notification to the police about the attack is also unconfirmed.

Despite the halt in production, Damm has fulfilled all deliveries using existing stocks. The company produces several beer brands, including the iconic Estrella Damm lager.

The cyber attack on Damm is the latest in a series of high-profile attacks that have led to increased scrutiny of security policies by governments and companies worldwide. A European Union report highlighted the rise in cyber-criminal activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In recent months, the Autonomous University of Barcelona and Spain's employment agency were also victims of ransomware attacks. The attacks have raised concerns about the vulnerability of Spanish companies and institutions to cyber threats.

Vidal stated that the company is working to strengthen its security measures to prevent future attacks. "We are taking this incident very seriously and are working to ensure that our systems are secure and that our customers' data is protected," she said.

The attack on Damm is a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity in the digital age. As companies increasingly rely on technology, they also become more vulnerable to cyber threats. It is crucial for companies to invest in robust security measures to protect their systems and data.

In conclusion, the cyber attack on Damm highlights the need for companies to be vigilant and proactive in their approach to cybersecurity. As the number of cyber attacks continues to rise, it is essential that companies take steps to protect themselves and their customers from the threat of cybercrime.
