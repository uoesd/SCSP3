Twitter Permanently Suspends President Trump's Account, Celebrities React

In a shocking move, Twitter has permanently suspended President Donald Trump's account, citing the risk of further incitement of violence. The decision came after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and in the wake of inflammatory posts by Trump.

Celebrities were quick to react to the news, with many expressing their support for the decision. Chrissy Teigen, who has been a vocal critic of Trump, tweeted, "I'm sorry, did I miss anything? 😅"

Julia Louis-Dreyfus, star of HBO's "Veep," tweeted, "Well, well, well. Look who's been permanently suspended from Twitter! 😏"

Sacha Baron Cohen, the creator of "Borat" and "The Ali G Show," took to Twitter to call for Trump's removal from YouTube, tagging CEOs Susan Wojcicki and Sundar Pichai. "Hey @SusanWojcicki & @SundarPichai, it's time to remove Trump from YouTube. He's inciting violence and spreading hate. #RemoveTrumpFromYouTube"

Comedian Billy Eichner humorously suggested forcing Trump to join Bumble instead of just banning him from Twitter. "Hey @realDonaldTrump, now that you're banned from Twitter, why don't you try Bumble? You can swipe right on all the MAGA hats you want. 😂"

The Twitter account for "The Daily Show With Trevor Noah" connected the ban to Melania Trump's anti-bullying campaign. "Melania Trump's 'Be Best' campaign is really working out well, isn't it? 😅"
