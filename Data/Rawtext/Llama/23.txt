Lockdown Imposed on All Federal Prisons Ahead of Inauguration

NEW YORK (AP) – In an unprecedented move, all federal prisons in the United States have been placed on lockdown ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. The lockdown, which affects over 120 Bureau of Prisons facilities, began at 12 a.m. Saturday and was implemented as a precautionary measure in light of events around the country.

According to Shane Fausey, President of the Council of Prison Locals, the decision to lock down the prisons was made to ensure the safety and security of both inmates and staff. "We take any potential threat seriously, and we're taking every precaution to ensure that our facilities are secure," Fausey said.

Justin Long, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons, confirmed that the lockdown was not prompted by any specific incidents within the facilities. "This is a precautionary measure to ensure the safety and security of our inmates, staff, and the public," Long said.

The lockdown means that inmates will have limited access to showers, phones, and email, and can participate in basic activities such as recreation and religious services. However, they will not be allowed to leave their cells or engage in any educational or vocational programs.

This is the second nationwide lockdown to be implemented by the Bureau of Prisons, following one in April due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Special Operations Response Teams are being relocated to Washington, D.C., to strengthen security in the nation's capital.

Aaron McGlothin, Local Union President at the Federal Prison in California, expressed concern about the impact of the lockdown on inmates. "We understand the need for security, but we also have to think about the well-being of the inmates," McGlothin said. "Prolonged lockdowns can have a negative effect on their mental and physical health."

The Bureau of Prisons has coordinated with the Justice Department to deploy additional resources as needed. "We are working closely with our partners at the Justice Department to ensure that we have the necessary resources to maintain security and ensure the safety of everyone involved," Long said.

In addition to the lockdown, a potential case of tuberculosis at a federal lockup in Mendota, California, has also been reported. The Bureau of Prisons has taken steps to isolate the inmate and prevent the spread of the disease.

The lockdown is expected to remain in place until after the inauguration. The Bureau of Prisons will continue to monitor the situation and adjust its protocols as necessary to ensure the safety and security of all involved.

Inmates' families have been notified of the lockdown, and they have been advised to contact the facility directly for information about visitation and communication with their loved ones.

The decision to lock down the prisons has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised the move as a necessary precaution, while others have expressed concern about the impact on inmates and their families.

Regardless of one's opinion on the matter, it is clear that the safety and security of everyone involved is of the utmost importance. As the country prepares for the inauguration of a new president, the Bureau of Prisons is taking every precaution to ensure that its facilities are secure and that everyone within their walls remains safe.
