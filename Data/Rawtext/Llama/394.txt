Google and Facebook Threaten to Limit Services in Australia Over Digital News Code

Google and Facebook have threatened to limit their services in Australia if a proposed digital news code requiring payment to news media goes ahead. The code, designed to support news media by requiring payments from digital platforms for content, has been met with resistance from the tech giants.

Mel Silva, Google's Australian managing director, described the code as untenable and a potential "dangerous precedent." "We cannot accept a situation where we are forced to pay for content that we do not want," she said.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has stood firm, insisting that Australia makes its own rules and won't respond to threats. "We will not be intimidated by threats from big tech companies," he said.

Reset Australia, a local advocacy group, has criticized Google for behaving like a "bully" towards the nation. "It's time for Google to stop threatening Australia and start working with us to find a solution that benefits everyone," said Chris Cooper, the group's executive director.

Facebook's Josh Machin claimed that limiting news content on the platform would not significantly affect it, since news makes up less than 5% of what users see. However, Dan Stinton, managing director of Guardian Australia, argued that quality journalism is essential to a healthy democracy and should be prioritized.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chair, Rod Sims, emphasized that the code promotes fairness in negotiations between digital platforms and news media. "We want to ensure that news media can continue to provide high-quality journalism to the Australian public," he said.

Labor's shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, expressed concern over the impracticability of the code. "We need to make sure that any solution is workable and doesn't unintentionally harm local news outlets," she said.

A recent poll found that a majority of Australians support prioritizing journalism in social media feeds and transparency about algorithm influences. "It's clear that Australians value quality journalism and want to see it supported," said Stinton.

Despite the backlash, Google and Facebook remain committed to their position. "We will continue to work with the government to find a solution that works for everyone," said Silva.

The proposed digital news code is part of a broader push to regulate the tech giants and promote fairness in the digital landscape. As the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether Google and Facebook will compromise or follow through on their threats to limit services in Australia.

In conclusion, the standoff between Google, Facebook, and the Australian government highlights the ongoing struggle to regulate the tech giants and promote fairness in the digital landscape. As the debate rages on, it's clear that the future of quality journalism in Australia hangs in the balance.
