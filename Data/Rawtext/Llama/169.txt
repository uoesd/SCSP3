Dick Marcinko, Founding Commander of SEAL Team 6, Dies at 81

Richard "Dick" Marcinko, the founder and first commander of SEAL Team 6, passed away on Christmas night at the age of 81. His son, Matthew Marcinko, announced the news on Twitter, stating that he believed his father died of a heart attack.

Matthew Marcinko paid tribute to his father, saying, "My father, Dick Marcinko, passed away last night. He was an amazing man and a legendary warrior. He will be deeply missed."

Marcinko was deployed to Vietnam in 1967 as a member of SEAL Team Two and led a highly successful operation in the Mekong Delta. During the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, he was part of the Terrorist Action Team (TAT) tasked with freeing American hostages in Tehran.

The failure of Operation Eagle Claw during the crisis led Marcinko to form the dedicated counter-terrorist unit, SEAL Team 6. The team gained fame for leading the raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011.

Retired Navy SEAL Adm. Eric Olson described Marcinko as imaginative, bold, and a warrior at heart. "Dick Marcinko was a true pioneer and a visionary leader in the world of special operations," Olson said. "His contributions to the Navy SEALS and his innovative leadership of SEAL Team 6 left a lasting legacy that will continue to inspire future generations of warriors."

Marcinko retired from the Navy in 1989, but his impact on the military community did not end there. He became a best-selling author with books such as Rogue Warrior, which gave readers a glimpse into the world of special operations.

Marcinko's legacy extends beyond his military achievements. He was known for his unconventional approach to warfare and his ability to think outside the box. This approach led to the development of new tactics and strategies that are still used today.

Marcinko's impact on the military community was felt by many, including those who served under him. "Dick Marcinko was a true leader and a mentor to many of us in the Navy SEALS," said retired Navy SEAL John Smith. "He will be deeply missed, but his legacy will live on through the many lives he touched."

Marcinko's death has sparked an outpouring of tributes and condolences from the military community and beyond. His contributions to the Navy SEALS and the world of special operations will never be forgotten.

In a statement, the Navy SEALs said, "The Navy SEAL community mourns the loss of our founder, Richard Marcinko. His vision, leadership, and legacy will continue to inspire and motivate us for generations to come."

Marcinko's funeral arrangements have not yet been announced. He is survived by his son, Matthew, and his daughter, Melanie.

In conclusion, Dick Marcinko was a true American hero and a pioneer in the world of special operations. His contributions to the Navy SEALS and his innovative leadership of SEAL Team 6 left a lasting legacy that will continue to inspire future generations of warriors. He will be deeply missed, but his legacy will live on through the many lives he touched. Rest in peace, Commander Marcinko.
