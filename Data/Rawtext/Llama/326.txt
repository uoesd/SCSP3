Fact Check: Did the Ever Given Cargo Ship Really Make a NSFW Route?

On March 23, 2021, the Ever Given cargo ship made headlines after it blocked the Suez Canal, disrupting global shipping traffic. Shortly after the incident, an image purportedly showing the ship's route began circulating on social media, with many claiming that it resembled a crude drawing of a penis. But is this image genuine, or is it just another case of misinformation spreading online?

The image in question shows the Ever Given's route before it got stuck in the Suez Canal, and it does indeed resemble a NSFW drawing. However, there's no evidence to suggest that the ship's route was intentionally designed to look like this. According to a spokesperson for Vesselfinder.com, a vessel-tracking service provider, the route is genuine and was created using data from the ship's Automatic Identification System (AIS).

"There's no room for some kind of conspiracies or false data," the spokesperson told Vice. "It's a real route, it's a real ship, and it's a real situation."

Vesselfinder.com even created a video simulation showing the ship's movements before the incident, further confirming the authenticity of the route image. Myshiptracking.com also shows the Ever Given's route resembling a NSFW drawing, adding to the evidence that the image is genuine.

Despite the image's authenticity, it's important to note that there's no evidence to suggest that the ship's route was intentionally designed to resemble a crude drawing. It's likely that the shape of the route was simply a result of the ship's movements and navigation through the canal.

The Ever Given's blockage of the Suez Canal had significant consequences for global shipping traffic, with CNN reporting that eight tugboats were trying to free the ship. The incident highlights the importance of the Suez Canal as a major shipping route, and the potential disruptions that can occur when accidents like this happen.

In conclusion, while the image of the Ever Given's route resembling a NSFW drawing is genuine, there's no evidence to suggest that it was intentionally designed to look like this. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of accurate information and fact-checking, especially in the age of social media where misinformation can spread quickly.
