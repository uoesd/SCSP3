Trump Lawyers Accuse Democrats of 'Hatred' in Impeachment Trial

WASHINGTON (AP) – Donald Trump's impeachment lawyers asserted on Friday that Democrats are fueled by "hatred" in their efforts to convict the former president for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. In their defense argument, Trump's lawyers maintained that his speech on that day was ordinary political rhetoric and that he did not incite the violence that ensued.

"What we have witnessed in this chamber over the past few days has been a campaign of hatred, a campaign of anger, a campaign of fear," said Michael van der Veen, one of Trump's lawyers. "It's a campaign that is unprecedented in American history, and it's a campaign that is beneath the dignity of this body."

The defense team played clips of various Democrats using similar language to Trump's, arguing that their words were just as inflammatory. They contended that Trump's encouragement to "fight like hell" was not meant to undermine the election results, but rather to motivate his supporters to advocate for their political beliefs.

Despite the defense's arguments, the Senate is moving towards a final vote and likely acquittal of Trump, with a two-thirds majority needed for conviction. Trump's defense used less than three of their allotted 16 hours, focusing on drawing equivalences between Trump's words and those of Democrats.

Democrats argue that Trump's months-long campaign to question the election results laid the groundwork for the Capitol riot. Senators, particularly Democrats, reacted with amusement or dismissed the defense's comparisons as distractions. Questions from senators after the argument included skepticism from Republicans about the defense's portrayal of Trump's actions.

Trump's lawyers argued he was entitled to dispute the 2020 election results, saying the violence was planned independently of his speech. The defense maintained that Trump's actions and speech were protected under the First Amendment, countering Democrats' portrayal of him as the "inciter in chief."

"The First Amendment protects the right to engage in political speech, even when that speech is controversial or unpopular," van der Veen said. "The First Amendment protects the right to question election results, even when those questions are uncomfortable or inconvenient."

The defense's argument was met with skepticism from some senators, who questioned whether Trump's actions and speech were truly protected under the First Amendment. However, Trump's lawyers remained steadfast in their argument that their client was not responsible for the violence that occurred on Jan. 6.

As the impeachment trial nears its end, it remains to be seen whether Trump will be acquitted or convicted. Regardless of the outcome, the events of Jan. 6 and the subsequent impeachment trial have left a lasting impact on American politics and the legacy of Donald Trump.
