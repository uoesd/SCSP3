Taiwan's de facto ambassador attends Biden's inauguration, signaling strong US ties

Taipei (Reuters) – Taiwan's de facto ambassador in Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim, attended President Joe Biden's inauguration with an official invitation, signaling strong ties between Taiwan and the United States. This move comes after the Trump administration increased support for Taiwan, including arms sales and visits by senior officials, which angered China.

Emily Horne, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, stated that the U.S. commitment to Taiwan is "rock-solid." Taiwan's foreign ministry highlighted that the formal invitation to the inauguration was a first and demonstrated the close friendship based on shared values of democracy, freedom, and human rights.

Hsiao Bi-khim expressed honor in representing Taiwan at the inauguration, emphasizing democracy and freedom as common objectives. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen congratulated the U.S. and expressed hopes for continued cooperation on regional democracy, freedom, peace, and stability.

Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, expressed favor for greater engagement with Taiwan. Tsai and Blinken met in 2015, indicating a pre-existing relationship between the current administration and Taiwan.

The United States formally ended diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979 in favor of China but remains legally bound to assist Taiwan in its defense. Despite this, there were concerns in Taiwan that President Joe Biden might not continue the level of support seen under Trump.

However, Hsiao Bi-khim's attendance at the inauguration suggests that the Biden administration values the relationship with Taiwan. Joanne Ou, spokeswoman for Taiwan's foreign ministry, stated that the invitation to the inauguration demonstrates the strong and friendly relations between Taiwan and the U.S.

In a statement, Hsiao Bi-khim said, "I am honored to represent Taiwan at President Biden's inauguration, highlighting our shared values of democracy, freedom, and human rights." He added, "Taiwan looks forward to continuing to work with the U.S. to promote regional peace, stability, and prosperity."

Tsai Ing-wen also expressed her congratulations to President Biden and emphasized the importance of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. "Taiwan and the U.S. share common values and strategic interests," she said. "We hope to continue working together to promote regional democracy, freedom, peace, and stability."

Antony Blinken, Biden's nominee for secretary of state, has previously expressed support for greater engagement with Taiwan. In 2015, he met with Tsai Ing-wen, indicating a pre-existing relationship between the current administration and Taiwan.

The attendance of Taiwan's de facto ambassador at Biden's inauguration suggests that the U.S. commitment to Taiwan remains strong. As tensions with China continue to rise, the U.S.-Taiwan relationship is likely to remain a key factor in regional politics.
