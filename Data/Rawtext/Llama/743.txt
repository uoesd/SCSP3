Alec Baldwin Did Not Pull Trigger in 'Rust' Set Shooting, Attorney Says

NEW YORK – In a developing story, attorney Lisa Torraco, representing Dave Halls, the first assistant director of the movie "Rust," has come forward to say that actor Alec Baldwin did not pull the trigger on the prop gun that fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the film's set.

In an interview with ABC News, Baldwin also stated, "I didn't pull the trigger."

The tragic incident took place on Oct. 21 during a dress rehearsal at Bonanza Creek Ranch, near Santa Fe, New Mexico. In addition to Hutchins' death, director Joel Souza was injured when the gun Baldwin was holding discharged.

The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office identified Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film's armorer, and Dave Halls as having handled the gun before the incident.

Torraco emphasized the shooting as a "freak, awful accident" and described Halls as "heartbroken."

No charges have been filed yet, but Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies stated, "Everything is on the table" regarding potential charges.

Investigators searched a gun store for new details but have not confirmed the source of the live rounds used.

Two related ABC specials will air discussing the 'Rust' shooting and featuring interviews with Baldwin and others involved.

According to a search warrant affidavit, Halls communicated a "cold gun" to the crew, indicating the firearm supposedly had no live rounds.

Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said, "The investigation is still ongoing. We're still interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence."

When asked if Baldwin was cooperating with the investigation, Mendoza replied, "Yes, he's been cooperative."

Carmack-Altwies added, "We're looking at all the facts, and we're going to follow the evidence where it leads us."

Torraco maintained that Halls was not responsible for the shooting, saying, "Dave Halls is not the person who pulled the trigger. He's not the person who loaded the gun."

Baldwin expressed his condolences to Hutchins' family, saying, "My heart is broken for her family. This is a tragedy."

The incident has sparked a renewed debate about gun safety on movie sets.

Torraco concluded, "This was a freak accident. It's a terrible, terrible tragedy, but it was an accident."

The investigation into the 'Rust' shooting continues, with no further details yet on potential charges or the source of the live rounds used.
