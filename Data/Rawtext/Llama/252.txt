FDA and CDC Lift Pause on Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Use in the US

After a thorough safety review, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have lifted the recommended pause on the use of the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. The pause was initially recommended due to six reports of a rare and severe type of blood clot following administration of the vaccine.

"The FDA and CDC take vaccine safety very seriously, and we have been closely monitoring the situation," said Janet Woodcock, M.D., Acting FDA Commissioner. "After a thorough review of the data, we have concluded that the benefits of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine outweigh the risks for individuals 18 years of age and older."

During the pause, medical and scientific teams from the FDA and CDC reviewed the data, assessed risks, and conducted outreach to healthcare providers. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has also reviewed the latest data on thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that has been reported in some individuals who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

"We understand that the pause may have caused some concern, but we want to reassure the public that we have a robust system in place to monitor vaccine safety," said Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, CDC Director. "We have been working closely with healthcare providers and the public to ensure that everyone has the information they need to make informed decisions about their health."

The FDA and CDC have concluded that the chance of TTS occurring is very low, and the benefits of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine continue to outweigh the risks for individuals 18 years of age and older. Healthcare providers and recipients are urged to review revised fact sheets that include information about the risk of TTS.

As of today, a total of 15 cases of TTS have been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), all in women aged between 18 and 59 years. The FDA and CDC are continuing to monitor the situation closely and will provide updates as necessary.

"We want to emphasize that safety is our top priority, and we have extensive monitoring systems in place to quickly identify and address any potential safety concerns," said Dr. Woodcock. "We encourage healthcare providers and the public to report any adverse events following vaccination to VAERS."

The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine has been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization due to COVID-19. The FDA and CDC continue to recommend that individuals 18 years of age and older receive the vaccine as part of their COVID-19 prevention strategy.

"We urge anyone who has questions or concerns about the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine to consult their healthcare provider," said Dr. Walensky. "It's important to remember that vaccines are one of the most effective ways to protect ourselves and our communities from COVID-19."

In summary, the FDA and CDC have lifted the recommended pause on the use of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine in the US, concluding that the benefits outweigh the risks for individuals 18 years of age and older. The agencies will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide updates as necessary. Healthcare providers and recipients are urged to review revised fact sheets that include information about the risk of TTS, and to report any adverse events following vaccination to VAERS.
