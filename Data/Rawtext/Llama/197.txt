Cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline Raises Concerns Over Lack of Mandatory Cybersecurity Measures

A recent ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, which forced the company to shut down its pipeline and caused fuel shortages across the East Coast, has raised concerns over the lack of mandatory cybersecurity measures in the transportation industry. Despite the authority to enforce mandatory rules, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has historically relied on voluntary compliance, influenced by industry resistance to regulation.

According to Colonial spokesman Kevin Feeney, the company had not undergone a voluntary, in-depth cybersecurity review with the TSA before the attack. This has sparked concerns among officials that critical infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks. Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), co-founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, stated that "We need to make sure that our critical infrastructure is protected from cyber threats. It's unacceptable that Colonial Pipeline didn't have a thorough cybersecurity review before this attack."

In response to the growing number of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure, the Department of Homeland Security is moving towards implementing mandatory rules for pipeline cybersecurity. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas emphasized the importance of adapting to new and emerging threats in cybersecurity, stating that "We must remain vigilant and proactive in the face of evolving threats to our nation's cybersecurity."

The TSA has historically partnered with the energy industry to set voluntary cybersecurity guidelines, without penalties for non-compliance. However, only 23 comprehensive cybersecurity assessments (VADR) were conducted by the TSA on pipeline companies as of late 2018. Michael Chertoff, former Secretary of Homeland Security, noted that "Voluntary guidelines are not enough to protect our critical infrastructure. We need mandatory measures to ensure that companies are taking cybersecurity seriously."

Colonial Pipeline has reportedly increased its IT spending by about 50% since 2017, hiring independent firms for cybersecurity risk assessments. However, this increase in spending did not prevent the recent ransomware attack. Jack Fox, head of TSA's pipeline security program, stated that "We need to do more to ensure that pipeline companies are taking cybersecurity seriously. Voluntary measures are not enough."

Gary Forman, director of corporate security at NiSource Inc., emphasized the importance of implementing mandatory cybersecurity measures, stating that "We need to make sure that all pipeline companies are held to the same standard. Mandatory measures will help ensure that everyone is taking cybersecurity seriously."

Tim Conway, industrial control systems cybersecurity instructor at the SANS Institute, noted that "Ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure are becoming more common. We need to make sure that companies are prepared to respond to these attacks and have measures in place to prevent them."

The recent ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline highlights the need for mandatory cybersecurity measures in the transportation industry. While voluntary guidelines have been in place for decades, it is clear that more needs to be done to protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats. The shift towards mandatory measures is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to ensure that all pipeline companies are taking cybersecurity seriously.

In conclusion, the recent ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline raises concerns over the lack of mandatory cybersecurity measures in the transportation industry. While voluntary guidelines have been in place for decades, it is clear that more needs to be done to protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats. The shift towards mandatory measures is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to ensure that all pipeline companies are taking cybersecurity seriously.
