Houston, TX - Dusty Hill, the iconic bearded bassist of ZZ Top, has passed away at the age of 72. His bandmates, Billy Gibbons and Frank Beard, announced his death on Facebook, stating that he died in his sleep at his Houston home. The cause of his death was not disclosed.

Born Joe Michael Hill, he joined ZZ Top in 1970 and was a key member as the band released 15 albums. Hill was known for his iconic beard, which both he and bandmate Gibbons grew out in the 1970s. In 1984, Hill and Gibbons were offered $1 million by Gillette to shave their beards but declined.

"We are saddened by the loss of our dear friend and bandmate, Dusty Hill," said Billy Gibbons in a statement. "He was an integral part of ZZ Top, and his contributions to the band's success cannot be overstated. He will be deeply missed."

Frank Beard, the band's drummer, also expressed his sadness at Hill's passing. "Dusty was not only a great musician, but a great friend and bandmate. We have shared so many memories and experiences together, and he will be greatly missed."

Prior to his death, Hill was recovering from a hip injury that led to the cancellation of some tour dates. He was replaced by the band's guitar tech, Elwood Francis, during his recent health-related absence from the tour.

ZZ Top's album 'Eliminator' was notably successful, selling over 10 million copies and featuring several hit songs. The band, including Hill, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.

Hill's legacy extends beyond his work with ZZ Top. He was a respected musician and songwriter, and his contributions to the music industry will be remembered for years to come.

Fans and fellow musicians have taken to social media to express their condolences and pay tribute to Hill's memory. His passing is a loss for the music world, but his legacy will continue to live on through his music.

In conclusion, Dusty Hill was a legendary musician and an integral part of ZZ Top's success. His iconic beard and contributions to the band's music will be remembered for years to come. He will be deeply missed by his bandmates, fans, and the music industry as a whole. Rest in peace, Dusty Hill.
