Melania Trump Keeping Low Profile, Focusing on Relaxation and Family

CNN – Palm Beach, Florida – Melania Trump has been keeping a low profile since leaving the White House, focusing on relaxation and staying away from politics, sources close to the former first lady have revealed.

According to Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former senior adviser to Melania Trump, the former first lady's daily routine at Mar-a-Lago involves going to the spa, having lunch, and dining with her family. "She's taking care of herself, enjoying her time away from the spotlight," Wolkoff said.

Melania Trump is also in the process of setting up an official office, where she plans to continue her Be Best campaign, which aimed to promote children's well-being and cyberbullying awareness.

However, Melania Trump has expressed bitterness and regret over the events following the January 6 insurrection and her departure from Washington. "She's disappointed with how things ended, and she's upset about her tarnished image," a source close to the former first lady said.

Melania Trump had the lowest favorability ratings of any modern first lady upon leaving office, and she decided against making a public statement condemning the January 6 Capitol riot, fearing backlash from either side.

Despite feeling overlooked by the media, Melania Trump turned down multiple offers for interviews and magazine features during her time as first lady. "She didn't want to be seen as trying to grab attention," Wolkoff said.

However, Melania Trump is now questioning her media strategy, placing the blame on others rather than herself. "She's frustrated that her message wasn't getting through, but she's not taking responsibility for it," a source close to the former first lady said.

Melania Trump has also taken note of the attention her successor, Jill Biden, is receiving and contrasts it with her own approach as first lady. "She's watching from the sidelines, seeing how Jill Biden is being received, and she's feeling a little jealous," a source close to the former first lady said.

Wolkoff believes that Melania Trump's low profile is a deliberate choice. "She's choosing to stay out of the spotlight, to focus on her family and her own well-being," Wolkoff said.

Despite her low profile, Melania Trump's legacy as first lady continues to be debated. While some praise her for her efforts to promote children's well-being, others criticize her for her controversial statements and actions, such as her infamous "I really don't care, do u?" jacket.

As Melania Trump continues to stay out of the public eye, it remains to be seen how her legacy will be remembered in the years to come.
