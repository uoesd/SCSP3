Harry & Meghan: The Third Installment

Lifetime's highly anticipated third installment of the Harry & Meghan movie franchise is set to debut on Labor Day, featuring Sydney Morton and Jordan Dean as the titular characters. The film promises to deliver a captivating portrayal of the royal couple's life, tackling issues such as racism, discrimination, and mental health.

In an exclusive interview with Town & Country, co-executive producers Michele Weiss and Merideth Finn discussed the reasoning behind recasting the leads and the process of creating the franchise. "We recast the roles because the actors from the first film, Parisa Fitz-Henley and Murray Fraser, became unavailable," Weiss explained. "We wanted to maintain consistency in the production team, including the director and writer, to ensure a cohesive vision across the movies."

Finn added, "We focus on finding a balance between resemblance to the real-life figures and acting ability. We look for unique attributes that make the actors suitable for the roles." This approach is evident in the casting of Morton and Dean, who both bear a striking resemblance to Harry and Meghan while bringing their own talents to the roles.

Adapting the royal couple's public personas into relatable, robust characters has been a crucial aspect of the franchise's success. "We want to humanize Harry and Meghan, making them accessible to the audience," Weiss said. "We delve into their personal struggles and triumphs, highlighting their strength and resilience."

The franchise has polarized audiences, much like the real-life Harry and Meghan. "People have strong opinions about the royal couple, and our films reflect that," Finn noted. "We've received both praise and criticism, but our primary goal is to tell an engaging story that resonates with viewers."

The third movie tackles significant issues, including racism and discrimination, which have been a consistent theme throughout the franchise. "We wanted to address these topics in a thoughtful and respectful manner," Weiss said. "It's essential to acknowledge the challenges Harry and Meghan have faced and how they've used their platform to raise awareness."

Before embarking on the franchise, Weiss and Finn admit they were not extensively familiar with the intricacies of the royal family. "We've learned so much during this process, and it's been a fascinating journey," Finn said. "We're proud to have created a franchise that not only entertains but also educates and sparks important conversations."

In conclusion, Lifetime's third Harry & Meghan movie promises to be a captivating addition to the franchise, offering a unique perspective on the royal couple's life and struggles. With a talented cast, dedicated production team, and thoughtful approach to tackling important issues, the film is sure to resonate with audiences this Labor Day.
