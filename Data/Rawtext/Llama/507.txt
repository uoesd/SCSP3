East Coast Transit Systems Struggle to Keep Up with Climate Change

NEW YORK (AP) – Hurricane Ida and other summer storms have highlighted the need for improved climate resilience in East Coast transit systems. Despite billions of dollars spent on coastal flooding protection since Superstorm Sandy, recent events show that more work is necessary.

In New York City, proposals include building canals to protect against flooding. "We need to be thinking about how we can adapt our infrastructure to be more resilient in the face of climate change," said Sanjay Seth, Boston's "climate resilience" program manager.

In Boston, climate change efforts focus on the Blue Line, with plans for a seawall and upgraded pumps. "We're trying to future-proof our system," said Janno Lieber, Acting CEO of the Metropolitan Transit Authority.

In Philadelphia, mixed success was seen with post-Sandy flood protection measures during summer storms. "We've made significant investments in flood protection, but we know there's more work to be done," said Joe Pesaturo, spokesperson for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.

The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority plans to continue armoring shorelines with concrete blocks. "We're doing everything we can to protect our infrastructure," said Bob Lund, Deputy General Manager.

In Washington, the WMATA is developing a climate resiliency plan and has upgraded its drainage systems and installed pumping stations. "We're taking steps to ensure our system can withstand the impacts of climate change," said Sherrie Ly, spokesperson for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.

However, there's concern whether transit systems are planning ambitiously enough for climate change challenges. "We need to be thinking about how we can adapt our infrastructure to be more resilient in the face of climate change," said Jesse Keenan, Associate Professor at Tulane University.

Global cities like London and Zhengzhou also struggle with flood management in their transit systems. "Cities around the world are facing similar challenges," said Michael Martello, Researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Funding remains a major challenge for implementing ambitious climate change projects in transit systems. "We need to invest in our infrastructure to ensure it's resilient for the future," said Sanjay Seth.

Despite the challenges, there's a sense of urgency to address climate change in East Coast transit systems. "We can't afford to wait – we need to take action now," said Janno Lieber.

In conclusion, Hurricane Ida and other summer storms have highlighted the need for improved climate resilience in East Coast transit systems. While progress has been made, more work is necessary to protect against the impacts of climate change. With continued investment and planning, transit systems can be better prepared for the challenges ahead.
