Dave Halls' History of Safety Neglect Leads to Tragedy on 'Rust' Set

In a tragic turn of events, the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of "Rust" has brought to light a history of safety neglect by assistant director Dave Halls. Halls, who handed Alec Baldwin the loaded gun that fatally shot Hutchins, has a reputation for ignoring safety measures on film sets, leading to multiple injuries.

One such incident occurred on the set of "Freedom's Path" in 2019, where Halls failed to provide actress Carol Sutton with a recommended crash pad, resulting in her injury. Sutton, who passed away at the age of 76, fell over in a scene due to inadequate safety measures.

Quinton Rodriguez, a first assistant camera operator on "Freedom's Path," recalled an incident where Halls failed to call "Cut" when a crew member was injured on set. "Dave Halls didn't seem to care about safety," Rodriguez said in an interview. "He was more concerned with getting the shot than making sure everyone was safe."

Halls was fired from "Freedom's Path" after a gun unexpectedly discharged, injuring a crew member. This incident occurred prior to the "Rust" tragedy, yet Halls continued working in the industry, leading to the fatal accident involving Hutchins.

Producers of "Freedom's Path" declined to comment on the prior incident involving Carol Sutton. However, they did confirm that Halls was removed from the set immediately after the prop gun discharged on their film.

Rodriguez provided new details about the gun discharge incident on the "Freedom's Path" set. "It was a chaotic scene, and Dave Halls didn't seem to have a handle on things," he said. "The gun was supposed to be unloaded, but it wasn't. It was a miracle no one was killed."

Despite the red flags surrounding Halls' behavior, he was hired as an assistant director on "Rust." The producers of the film have yet to comment on their decision to hire Halls, given his history of safety neglect.

The tragic events on the "Rust" set have sparked a conversation about safety protocols in the film industry. Many are calling for stricter safety measures and better accountability for those in charge of set safety.

As the investigation into the "Rust" tragedy continues, it's clear that Dave Halls' history of safety neglect played a significant role in the events that unfolded. The question remains: how could this have been allowed to happen, and what can be done to prevent such tragedies in the future?

In a statement, the producers of "Rust" expressed their deepest condolences to the family of Halyna Hutchins. "We are cooperating fully with the investigation and are committed to ensuring that a tragedy like this never happens again," they said.

The death of Halyna Hutchins is a devastating reminder of the importance of safety on film sets. It's time for the industry to take a hard look at its safety protocols and ensure that those in charge of set safety are held accountable for their actions.
