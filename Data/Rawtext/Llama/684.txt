Seeking Justice for Chrystul Kizer: Advocates Draw Parallels with Kyle Rittenhouse Acquittal

In the wake of Kyle Rittenhouse's acquittal on all charges related to the deaths of two men during a Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, advocates for Chrystul Kizer are calling for similar justice for the teenager who killed her alleged sex trafficker. Kizer, who was 17 at the time of the killing, is accused of murdering Randall Volar, a man awaiting trial for human trafficking. She asserts that she acted in self-defense and is awaiting trial, facing multiple felony charges including first-degree intentional homicide.

Jess Singh, a protestor and Kenosha resident, emphasized the parallel between Kizer's case and Rittenhouse's acquittal. "Both cases involve self-defense, and both cases involve the justice system failing to protect victims of violence," Singh said. "We need to recognize that Chrystul Kizer is a victim of sex trafficking, and she deserves the same consideration as Kyle Rittenhouse."

Advocates for Kizer argue that her case deserves similar consideration to Rittenhouse's, highlighting the self-defense claim. "Chrystul Kizer was forced into a situation where she had to defend herself, just like Kyle Rittenhouse," said a spokesperson for the local chapter of the ACLU. "The fact that she's facing multiple felony charges while her alleged trafficker was allowed to roam free is a travesty of justice."

Demonstrations were held in Kenosha to protest Rittenhouse's verdict and to bring attention to Kizer's case. Protesters carried signs reading "Justice for Chrystul Kizer" and "End Sex Trafficking Now."

In a rare move, an appeals court allowed Kizer the right to use the "affirmative" defense, arguing her actions were a direct result of being trafficked. However, the State Supreme Court is still reviewing whether Kizer can use this defense in her trial.

Kizer was released on bond in 2020 after community groups raised $400,000. Rittenhouse's bond was $2 million, also raised by supporters.

The comparison between Kizer's case and Rittenhouse's acquittal has sparked a renewed debate about the criminal justice system's treatment of victims of violence. "The system is broken, and it's failing victims like Chrystul Kizer," said a local activist. "We need to recognize that victims of sex trafficking are not criminals, they're survivors."

As Kizer's case moves forward, advocates are calling for the same level of justice for her as was afforded to Rittenhouse. "Chrystul Kizer deserves the same consideration as Kyle Rittenhouse," said Singh. "Both cases are about self-defense, and both cases are about justice for victims of violence."

The outcome of Kizer's case could have far-reaching implications for victims of sex trafficking and the criminal justice system as a whole. "We need to recognize that victims of sex trafficking are not disposable," said a local lawyer. "They deserve justice, and they deserve protection."

As the community continues to rally around Kizer, the question remains: will justice be served for this teenager who fought back against her alleged trafficker? Only time will tell.
