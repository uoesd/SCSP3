Ex-Cop Derek Chauvin Accused of Using Excessive Force Against Six Other Suspects

In a disturbing report by The Marshall Project, it has been revealed that Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged in the death of George Floyd, used strong-arm tactics against six other suspects since 2015. The report outlines instances of Chauvin using neck restraints on people of color, including Zoya Code, who shared her harrowing experience of being restrained by Chauvin in 2017.

"He pressed harder on my neck when I challenged him," Code said in an interview with The Marshall Project. "I felt like I was going to die."

Prosecutors in Chauvin's case aim to use details of Code's arrest to support their second-degree murder charge against him. A judge has approved the use of Code's case, but excluded five other instances of Chauvin's alleged use of excessive force from the trial.

The Marshall Project interviewed other alleged victims and witnesses, all people of color, who had violent encounters with Chauvin. One of the incidents includes Chauvin putting a man in a chokehold as an off-duty security guard, while another involves Chauvin allegedly macing and restraining a man who asked for a ride.

"I was terrified for my life," said Julian Hernandez, who was put in a chokehold by Chauvin. "I couldn't breathe. I thought he was going to kill me."

Jimmy Bostic, who was also restrained by Chauvin, shared a similar experience. "I felt like he was trying to break my neck," Bostic said. "I was scared, man. I didn't know what was going to happen."

Sir Rilee Peet, an eyewitness to one of Chauvin's alleged assaults, described the scene as "chaotic and violent." "I saw Chauvin slam the guy onto the ground and put his knee on his neck," Peet said. "It was like he was trying to crush him."

Chauvin's lawyer, Eric Nelson, has argued that these prior incidents were not unreasonable or unauthorized, and Chauvin committed no crimes. However, Nelson did not respond to requests for comment from The Marshall Project. In court papers, Nelson has stated that there was no improper action by Chauvin.

Monroe Skinaway, another alleged victim of Chauvin's excessive force, expressed fear for his life, drawing parallels to Floyd's death. "I thought it was going to be the end for me," Skinaway said. "It's like they don't care about our lives. They just want to hurt us."

The revelations of Chauvin's past behavior have sparked outrage and calls for justice. "This is not just a one-time mistake," said a local activist. "This is a pattern of abuse and violence. Chauvin needs to be held accountable."

As the trial of Derek Chauvin continues, the spotlight remains on the Minneapolis Police Department and its history of racialized violence. The question on everyone's mind is: how many more victims will come forward?

In a statement, the Minneapolis Police Department said they take all allegations of excessive force seriously and are committed to transparency and accountability. However, the community remains skeptical, demanding justice for the victims of police brutality.

The case against Derek Chauvin is a stark reminder of the need for police reform and the importance of holding law enforcement accountable for their actions. As the nation watches, the people of Minneapolis and beyond demand justice for George Floyd and all the victims of police violence.
