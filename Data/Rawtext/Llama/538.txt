UK Warns of 'Credible' IS Attack on Kabul Airport, Advises Against Travel

LONDON, Aug 26 – The UK government has issued a stern warning against travel to Kabul airport, citing "very, very credible" intelligence of an imminent Islamic State (IS) attack. The British foreign ministry has advised people to stay away from the airport and await further instructions, as the threat has been described as credible, imminent, and lethal by armed forces minister James Heappey.

Despite the warnings, large crowds have gathered at the airport, posing a significant concern for authorities. Western nations, including the UK, are relying on the Taliban for security outside the airport, as they continue to evacuate their citizens and eligible Afghans.

"The threat is credible, imminent, and lethal," James Heappey told reporters. "We have taken this decision based on the intelligence that we have, and we believe that it is right to advise people not to travel to the airport."

The UK has already evacuated over 12,000 people from Afghanistan and plans to operate 11 more flights. However, with the worsening security situation, there is a possibility that not everyone will be evacuated. Approximately 400 eligible individuals, mostly British or dual nationals, remain in Afghanistan.

The intelligence indicates a possible suicide bomb attack by IS militants, who have been known to target crowded areas. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at the airport earlier this month, which killed 12 people.

The UK's warning comes as the US and other Western nations have also issued similar alerts. The US embassy in Kabul has advised its citizens to avoid the airport and to leave the country immediately.

The situation in Afghanistan remains tense, with the Taliban and IS militants vying for control. The UK and other Western nations have been criticized for their handling of the crisis, with some accusing them of abandoning their Afghan allies.

In response to the criticism, the UK government has defended its decision to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, citing the need to prioritize the safety of its citizens. The government has also pledged to continue supporting Afghanistan through aid and diplomatic efforts.

As the situation in Afghanistan continues to deteriorate, the international community remains on high alert. The UK's warning of a possible IS attack on Kabul airport serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by terrorist groups in the region.

In conclusion, the UK's warning of a credible IS attack on Kabul airport has highlighted the ongoing threat posed by terrorist groups in Afghanistan. The situation remains tense, with large crowds gathering at the airport despite warnings. The UK and other Western nations continue to evacuate their citizens and eligible Afghans, but the worsening security situation raises concerns about the possibility of not everyone being evacuated.
