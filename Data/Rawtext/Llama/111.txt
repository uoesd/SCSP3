Chris Cuomo Faces Criticism for Not Reporting Brother's Sex Crime Charge on CNN Show

In a surprising turn of events, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo has come under fire for not mentioning his brother Andrew Cuomo's recent misdemeanor sex crime charge on his show. Andrew Cuomo, the former Governor of New York, was charged with forcible touching, defined as touching intimate parts for the purpose of abuse or sexual gratification, based on an incident from December 2020.

According to a spokesperson for New York State Court, "Andrew Cuomo was charged with one count of forcible touching, a class A misdemeanor." The charge stems from an incident that took place in December 2020, where Cuomo allegedly touched a woman's intimate parts without her consent.

Chris Cuomo, who was reporting from Vatican City, did not mention the charge on his show, instead focusing on other news such as Capitol Hill's infighting and the Alec Baldwin shooting incident. This has led to criticism from some viewers, who feel that Chris Cuomo has a conflict of interest and should have reported on his brother's charge.

In response to the criticism, a spokesperson for Andrew Cuomo released a statement, criticizing the charge as politically motivated and targeting New York Attorney General Letitia James. "The charge against Governor Cuomo is a politically motivated attack, and we will vigorously defend against it," the spokesperson said.

Andrew Cuomo resigned in August following a report by AG James, which detailed sexual harassment allegations from 11 women. Chris Cuomo previously addressed his brother's scandal, stating his inability to be objective and his efforts to support his brother.

Chris Cuomo has faced criticism in the past for his involvement in his brother's defense strategy and for receiving COVID testing from his brother's administration. He has also been accused of sexual harassment by veteran TV producer Shelley Ross, relating to an incident in 2005.

In a statement, Chris Cuomo addressed the criticism, stating, "I understand the criticism, but I have to follow the same rules as everyone else. I cannot report on my brother, and I will continue to support him in any way I can."

CNN has policies in place that prevent Chris Cuomo from reporting on his brother, which he has adhered to thus far. Despite this, some viewers feel that Chris Cuomo's close relationship with his brother creates a conflict of interest and that he should not be reporting on any news related to the Cuomo administration.

Shelley Ross, the veteran TV producer who accused Chris Cuomo of sexual harassment, spoke out about the incident, stating, "I was surprised that Chris Cuomo was not more forthcoming about his brother's charge. As someone who has been affected by sexual harassment, I believe it's important for journalists to hold themselves to a higher standard."

The controversy surrounding Chris Cuomo's reporting on his brother's charge highlights the challenges that journalists face when it comes to reporting on sensitive topics, especially when they involve family members. While Chris Cuomo has maintained that he cannot report on his brother, some viewers feel that he should do more to address the issue and ensure that his reporting is unbiased.

In conclusion, Chris Cuomo's decision not to report on his brother's sex crime charge has sparked controversy and raised questions about the role of journalists in reporting on sensitive topics. While Chris Cuomo has followed CNN's policies and maintained that he cannot report on his brother, some viewers feel that he should do more to address the issue and ensure that his reporting is unbiased.
