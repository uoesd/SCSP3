Texans Won't Have to Pay High Electricity Bills from Winter Storm, Settlement Says

A settlement announced by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has brought relief to Griddy Energy customers who were facing high electricity bills due to the winter storm in February. The storm left millions of Texans without power and resulted in at least 210 deaths.

According to the settlement, Griddy Energy customers will not have to pay for the high electricity bills incurred during the storm. "We are pleased to announce that we have reached a settlement that will provide relief to Griddy Energy customers who were affected by the winter storm," Paxton said in a statement.

The Texas Attorney General sued Griddy Energy for misleading advertising after customers received very high bills. Griddy Energy offered a wholesale electricity rate, which caused bills to skyrocket during the storm. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the legal issues from the winter storm.

Under the settlement, former Griddy customers will be released from any outstanding balances unless they opt out. Former customers who paid their bills can seek reimbursement through bankruptcy court. The settlement also prevents Griddy and its parent company from making misleading statements in their advertising.

"This settlement is a victory for Texans who were taken advantage of by Griddy Energy's misleading advertising practices," Paxton said. "We will continue to protect Texans from deceptive business practices and ensure that companies are held accountable for their actions."

The settlement comes as a relief to many Texans who were facing high electricity bills due to the winter storm. "I'm grateful for the Attorney General's office for taking action against Griddy Energy," said Maria Rodriguez, a former Griddy customer. "I was worried about how I was going to pay my electricity bill, but now I can breathe a sigh of relief."

The settlement is a result of the Attorney General's office's efforts to protect Texans from deceptive business practices. "We will continue to monitor the energy industry and take action against any company that engages in misleading advertising practices," Paxton said.

In a statement, Griddy Energy said, "We are pleased to have reached a settlement with the Texas Attorney General's office. We understand that our advertising practices may have been misleading, and we apologize for any confusion or harm caused to our customers."

The settlement is a positive outcome for Texans who were affected by the winter storm. "I'm glad that the Attorney General's office took action against Griddy Energy," said John Smith, a former Griddy customer. "I was worried about my electricity bill, but now I can focus on recovering from the storm."

In conclusion, the settlement between Griddy Energy and the Texas Attorney General's office is a victory for Texans who were taken advantage of by the company's misleading advertising practices. The settlement provides relief to former Griddy customers who were facing high electricity bills due to the winter storm. The Attorney General's office will continue to protect Texans from deceptive business practices and ensure that companies are held accountable for their actions.
