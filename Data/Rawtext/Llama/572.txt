UN Chief Condemns 'Horrific' Attack on Kunduz Mosque in Afghanistan

The United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, has strongly condemned the suicide bombing at a mosque in Kunduz, Afghanistan, which killed and injured over 100 people. The attack is the third on a religious institution in the country in less than a week, and Guterres described it as a "horrific" act that violates human rights and international humanitarian law.

"I condemn in the strongest terms the suicide bombing at a mosque in Kunduz, Afghanistan, which has resulted in the killing and injury of scores of innocent people," Guterres said in a statement. "Such acts of terrorism are a grave threat to international peace and security, and they must be condemned by all."

The attack, which was claimed by the extremist Islamist faction IKSP, targeted the Shia Muslim community and is part of a disturbing pattern of violence against religious institutions in Afghanistan. The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has expressed concern over the recent attacks on mosques and a school, which have resulted in the deaths and injuries of many civilians, including children.

Guterres emphasized the need to bring the perpetrators of such attacks to justice and expressed his condolences to the families of the victims. "I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims and wish a speedy recovery to those injured," he said. "The perpetrators of such acts must be held accountable."

The UN Security Council has also condemned the attack, underscoring the need to hold perpetrators accountable and reiterating that terrorism constitutes a grave threat to international peace and security.

In a statement, the Security Council members expressed their deepest condolences to the families of the victims and reaffirmed their commitment to supporting the government of Afghanistan in its efforts to combat terrorism and ensure the safety and security of all Afghans.

The attack on the Kunduz mosque is the latest in a series of violent incidents in Afghanistan, which has seen a surge in terrorist attacks in recent months. The UN has called for increased efforts to address the root causes of terrorism and to protect civilians from the impact of violence.

Guterres reiterated the UN's commitment to supporting the people of Afghanistan in their quest for peace and security. "The United Nations remains committed to supporting the government and people of Afghanistan in their efforts to build a peaceful and secure future for their country," he said.

In conclusion, the attack on the Kunduz mosque is a stark reminder of the dangers faced by civilians in Afghanistan, particularly those from religious minorities. The UN has called for increased efforts to protect civilians and to address the root causes of terrorism, and has reiterated its commitment to supporting the people of Afghanistan in their quest for peace and security.
