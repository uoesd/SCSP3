Capitol Police Criticized for Lack of Preparation and Poor Response to Jan. 6 Riot

A new report by Capitol Police Inspector General Michael A. Bolton has revealed a lack of preparation and poor response by the Capitol Police to the Jan. 6 riot, which left several people injured and property damaged. Despite warnings of a potential threat to Congress, Capitol Police leadership dismissed threat assessments and limited officers' riot-prevention equipment, leading to failures in intelligence, equipment readiness, and operational preparedness.

According to Bolton's report, the Capitol Police leadership ignored or underestimated warnings from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security about potential violence on Jan. 6. Former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund resigned, claiming that lack of intelligence predicted the riot's scale, a claim that is contradicted by Bolton's findings.

The report critiques the leadership for not allowing the use of heavier less-lethal weapons and for the lack of standards for equipment. Bolton's findings include issues with police equipment, such as shields that shattered upon impact due to improper storage. The report suggests a need for deep reforms within the Capitol Police department and its culture.

The Capitol riot has sparked discussions and comparisons regarding the perceived difference in police response to the Capitol riot versus Black Lives Matter protests. While some have criticized the police for their restraint during the Capitol riot, others have pointed out that the police response to Black Lives Matter protests has been much more aggressive.

In a statement, Bolton said, "The Capitol Police leadership's lack of preparation and poor response to the Jan. 6 riot was unacceptable. The department's failures in intelligence, equipment readiness, and operational preparedness put officers and civilians at risk. It's clear that deep reforms are needed within the Capitol Police department and its culture."

Steven Sund, the former Capitol Police Chief, defended his department's response, saying, "We did the best we could with the resources we had. The scale of the riot was unprecedented, and we were caught off guard."

However, Bolton's report paints a different picture, stating that the Capitol Police leadership was warned about the potential for violence but failed to take adequate measures to prepare. The report concludes that the Capitol Police department needs to improve its intelligence gathering, equipment readiness, and operational preparedness to prevent future failures.

In conclusion, the Capitol Police's response to the Jan. 6 riot has been widely criticized, and Bolton's report highlights the need for deep reforms within the department. The incident has also sparked discussions about police response to different types of protests and the need for greater accountability and transparency within law enforcement agencies.
