Senate Republicans Block Bipartisan Commission to Investigate Capitol Riot

In a controversial move, Senate Republicans voted to block a bill that would have created a bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6th Capitol riot. The bill, which passed in the Democratic-led House with support from 35 Republican members, failed to overcome the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate, effectively killing the measure.

President Joe Biden expressed disbelief that anyone would vote against the commission, emphasizing the severity of the Capitol assault. "It's unconscionable that anyone would vote against getting to the bottom of what happened on January 6th," he said.

Despite the President's words, Senate Republicans argued that the commission would duplicate other investigations and should also examine violence during last summer's racial justice protests. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the commission a "purely political exercise" and suggested focusing on the current administration's policies instead.

Six Republican Senators, including Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Rob Portman of Ohio, and Susan Collins of Maine, voted in favor of advancing the bill. However, their support was not enough to overcome the opposition from the rest of their party.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the vote, suggesting politics prevailed over truth. "It's a sad day when politics gets in the way of finding the truth," he said. Schumer also hinted at the possibility of another vote on the bill in the future.

Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski criticized Republican leadership's opposition to the bill, emphasizing the need for accountability for the January 6th events. "We need to take a closer look at what happened and why, and we need to hold people accountable," she said.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and McConnell argued the commission would interfere with other investigations and should examine other violent protests. However, Speaker Nancy Pelosi hinted at the possibility of forming a separate panel to investigate the riot if a bipartisan commission could not be established.

The failed bill had been introduced by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and had received support from both Republicans and Democrats. Manchin expressed disappointment at the vote, saying, "I'm disappointed that we couldn't get this bill passed. The American people deserve to know what happened on January 6th."

Senate Minority Leader Dick Durbin of Illinois also criticized the vote, saying, "It's a shame that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle couldn't support this bill. We need to get to the bottom of what happened and make sure it never happens again."

House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, echoed Durbin's sentiments. "We need to investigate this attack on our democracy and make sure that those responsible are held accountable," she said.

Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chair and a Democrat from California, also expressed support for the bill. "We need to get to the bottom of what happened on January 6th and make sure that our democracy is protected," he said.

Gladys Sicknick, the mother of the late Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died as a result of the riot, also spoke out in support of the bill. "I want to know what happened to my son and why," she said. "We deserve the truth."

The failure of the bill to create a bipartisan commission to investigate the Capitol riot has sparked controversy and raised questions about the commitment of Senate Republicans to uncovering the truth behind the events of January 6th. As the country continues to grapple with the aftermath of the riot, it remains to be seen whether a separate panel will be formed to investigate the incident.
