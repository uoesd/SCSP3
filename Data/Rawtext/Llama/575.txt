Biden Faces Backlash from Families of Fallen Soldiers over 'Scripted and Shallow' Meeting

President Joe Biden faced harsh criticism from families of the 13 soldiers killed in Kabul, Afghanistan, during a recent meeting at Dover Air Force Base. The families felt that the meeting was "scripted and shallow," with one woman shouting at Biden to "burn in hell" as he left the base.

Mark Schmitz, father of deceased Jared Schmitz, expressed frustration over Biden mentioning his own son and allegedly checking his watch during the meeting. "I don't think he was genuine. It seemed like he was reading a script," Schmitz said.

The veracity of Biden checking his watch during the dignified transfer is debated. White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended Biden, emphasizing his empathetic intent despite the criticisms. "The President was not checking his watch. He was looking at his notes to make sure he properly acknowledged each family member," Psaki said.

Former President Donald Trump and others criticized Biden for his actions and comments during the meeting. Trump tweeted, "Biden is a total disaster. He has no idea what he's doing."

Jiennah McCollum, widow of Marine Lance Corporal Rylee McCollum, and her sister described their disappointment with Biden's conversation as "scripted and shallow." "It felt like he was just reading off a piece of paper," McCollum said.

Darin Hoover, father of Taylor Hoover, refused to speak with Biden and criticized him for checking his watch during the dignified transfer of coffins. "I didn't want to talk to him. I didn't want to have anything to do with him," Hoover said.

Kathy McCollum voiced her grief and anger on SiriusXM Patriot, calling Biden a "feckless, dementia-ridden piece of crap." "I don't think he cares about our soldiers. I don't think he cares about our country," McCollum said.

Instagram temporarily deleted Shana Chappell's account, mother of Lance Corporal Kareem M Nikoui, due to her criticisms of Biden. Facebook later restored it, stating it was a mistake.

In response to the backlash, Biden released a statement expressing his condolences and reiterating his commitment to supporting the families of the fallen soldiers. "I understand that the grief and anger of the families who lost their loved ones in Kabul is still raw and overwhelming. My heart goes out to them, and I am committed to doing everything in my power to support them," Biden said.

Despite the controversy, some families of the fallen soldiers have come to Biden's defense. "I think he's doing the best he can," said Karen Kwiatkowski, mother of Lance Corporal Kareem M Nikoui. "It's not an easy job, and he's got a lot on his plate."

The meeting between Biden and the families of the fallen soldiers has sparked a national conversation about the proper way to honor and support those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. While opinions on the matter vary widely, one thing is clear: the families of our fallen heroes deserve our deepest respect and gratitude.

In conclusion, the controversy surrounding Biden's meeting with the families of the fallen soldiers in Kabul serves as a poignant reminder of the immense sacrifices made by our military personnel and their families. As a nation, we must continue to support and honor these heroes, and ensure that their sacrifices are never forgotten.
