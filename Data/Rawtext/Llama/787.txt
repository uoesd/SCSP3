IRS Distributes Coronavirus Relief Checks to Over 90 Million Americans

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has distributed coronavirus relief checks to over 90 million Americans under President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan. The agency has been working tirelessly to ensure that eligible individuals receive their payments as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Additional Payments Forthcoming

The IRS has already distributed millions of payments, but additional payments are forthcoming. Individuals can use the IRS' 'Get My Payment' tool to check the status of their stimulus payment. The tool updates once daily, and the IRS advises against calling for payment information.

Eligibility and Payment Amounts

The third round of Economic Impact Payments is based on either the 2020 or 2019 tax returns, including for non-filers and those who submitted simplified returns. Individuals who previously received stimulus checks via direct deposit but won't this time, will receive either a check or a prepaid debit card.

Social Security and federal beneficiaries will generally receive their payments the same way as regular benefits. The stimulus payment amounts to $1,400 for a single person or $2,800 for a married couple, plus $1,400 for each dependent child. Payments decrease for those earning above $75,000 ($150,000 for couples), phasing out entirely above $80,000 ($160,000 for couples).

Tax Filing Deadline Extended

Due to COVID relief payments and tax refund delays, the IRS has extended the tax filing deadline to May 17. This will give individuals additional time to file their taxes and ensure that they receive their stimulus payments.

'Get My Payment' Tool Requirements

The 'Get My Payment' tool requires a Social Security number, tax ID, date of birth, street address, and ZIP code to show payment status. Individuals can use the tool to check the status of their payment, confirm their eligibility, and see how they will receive their payment.

How to Use the 'Get My Payment' Tool

To use the 'Get My Payment' tool, individuals can visit the IRS website and click on the 'Get My Payment' button. They will then be prompted to enter their personal information, including their Social Security number, tax ID, date of birth, street address, and ZIP code. Once they have entered their information, they will be able to see the status of their payment and how they will receive it.

When to Expect Your Payment

The IRS is distributing payments on a rolling basis, and individuals can expect to receive their payments within the next few weeks. The agency advises individuals to check the 'Get My Payment' tool regularly for updates on their payment status.
