House Intelligence Committee Seeks Information on CIA's Alleged Plots Against WikiLeaks and Julian Assange

Washington, D.C. - The House Intelligence Committee has launched an inquiry into the CIA's alleged plans to target WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange, following a Yahoo News report detailing plots to kidnap and possibly assassinate him. The committee has reached out to the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) for information.

"We are seeking information from the CIA and ODNI regarding the allegations made in the Yahoo News report," said Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee chairman. "It is important that we get to the bottom of this matter and ensure that any actions taken by the intelligence community were lawful and appropriate."

The Yahoo News report, published last week, revealed that the CIA had planned to kidnap Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has been holed up since 2012. The plan was reportedly pushed by former CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who also considered assassination as an option. The report sparked outrage and calls for transparency and accountability.

Schiff stated that he was not briefed about these plans in 2017, when they were allegedly being discussed within the Trump administration. "It is disturbing to hear that such plans were being considered, and it is important that we determine the extent to which these plans were developed and whether they were ever implemented," he said.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and over 20 other groups have urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to drop Assange's prosecution based on these revelations. Assange's lawyers plan to use the CIA's alleged misconduct to argue against his extradition from the UK to the US.

Pompeo has acknowledged some truth in the Yahoo News story but denied any illegal plans to assassinate Assange. However, the report has sparked calls for his testimony before Congress.

The House Intelligence Committee's inquiry is the latest development in a long-running saga between WikiLeaks and the US government. WikiLeaks has been under investigation by the US Department of Justice since 2010, when it published a large cache of classified documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Assange has been charged with 18 counts of espionage and conspiracy to commit espionage.

The allegations against the CIA have raised concerns about the agency's role in targeting journalists and whistleblowers. "The CIA's alleged actions against WikiLeaks and Julian Assange are a threat to the freedom of the press and the rule of law," said Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. "The US government must respect the rights of journalists and whistleblowers, and it must be held accountable for any violations of those rights."

The House Intelligence Committee's inquiry is likely to be a long and contentious process, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability within the intelligence community. As the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen what consequences, if any, the CIA and its officials will face for their alleged actions against WikiLeaks and Julian Assange.
