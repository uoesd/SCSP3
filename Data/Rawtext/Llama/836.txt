Tiger Woods Confused, Uncooperative in Hospital Interview After Crash

In a startling new report, golf legend Tiger Woods mistakenly believed he was in Florida during a hospital interview following his February car crash in Los Angeles. The report, authored by Sergeant Michael Downing, also reveals that Woods' blood pressure was too low to administer pain medication, and an empty pharmaceutical bottle was found at the crash scene.

According to the report, Vehicle data indicates Woods was going straight with no steering input detected until late in the crash sequence. The crash was caused by Woods driving at a speed unsafe for the road conditions and his inability to negotiate a curve. Woods was traveling over 82 mph in a 45-mph zone and applied the gas pedal at 99% just before the crash.

There was no evidence of braking or steering to avoid the crash, leading to speculation Woods might have been unconscious. However, investigators found no reason to believe Woods was impaired by alcohol or drugs at the time of the crash.

Woods was described as 'somewhat combative' post-crash, attributed to the trauma and shock from his injuries. This is Woods' third driving incident since 2009, with previous incidents including a careless driving citation and a DUI arrest.

"Based on the data, it's clear that Mr. Woods was driving at a speed that was unsafe for the road conditions," said Jonathan Cherney, a former police detective and forensic crash reconstruction expert. "The fact that he didn't brake or steer away from the crash suggests he may have been unconscious or incapacitated in some way."

Officer Justin Smith, who investigated the crash, stated, "We take these types of incidents very seriously, and we're grateful that Mr. Woods was not more seriously injured. However, we must emphasize the importance of safe driving practices, especially for high-profile individuals who may be under additional stress or pressure."

Sheriff Alex Villanueva echoed these sentiments, saying, "We're glad that Mr. Woods is recovering, but we must remind everyone that driving is a serious responsibility that requires full attention and focus. We will continue to investigate this incident and work to prevent similar tragedies in the future."

Deputy Kyle Sullivan, who interviewed Woods post-crash, noted, "Mr. Woods was understandably shaken and confused, but he was also somewhat uncooperative. We had to repeatedly ask him questions and clarify his statements, as he seemed to be under stress and not fully aware of his surroundings."

The report's findings have sparked renewed concerns about Woods' driving habits and the potential risks he may pose to himself and others on the road. As one of the most celebrated athletes in modern history, Woods' actions are closely scrutinized, and this latest incident has raised questions about his judgment and responsibility behind the wheel.

In conclusion, the report on Tiger Woods' February car crash paints a disturbing picture of a driver who was going too fast for road conditions, failed to brake or steer away from the crash, and was found with an empty pharmaceutical bottle at the scene. While Woods' injuries were thankfully not more severe, the incident serves as a sobering reminder of the dangers of reckless driving and the need for all drivers to prioritize safety on our roads.
