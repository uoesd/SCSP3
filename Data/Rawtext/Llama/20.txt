Star-Studded Inauguration: Lady Gaga, J.Lo, Garth Brooks, and More to Perform for Joe Biden's Big Day

Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, Garth Brooks, Justin Timberlake, Jon Bon Jovi, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Leslie Jones, Eva Longoria, and Tom Hanks are set to appear during Joe Biden's inauguration festivities, which will be mostly virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic and recent security concerns. Despite the challenges, the Presidential Inaugural Committee (PIC) CEO Tony Allen highlighted the inauguration as a chance to showcase American resilience and unity.

"This inauguration is an opportunity for us to come together as a nation and celebrate the peaceful transfer of power, even in the face of unprecedented challenges," Allen said in a statement.

The inauguration events will be live-streamed on the Biden inauguration website and various social media platforms, allowing Americans from all over the country to participate in the celebration. Garth Brooks, who is scheduled to perform during the inauguration, emphasized the non-political nature of his performance, focusing on unity instead.

"I'm honored to be a part of this momentous occasion, and I'm excited to help bring people together through the power of music," Brooks said in a statement.

Lady Gaga is scheduled to perform "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the inauguration ceremony, while a virtual "Parade Across America" featuring representatives from all 50 states will follow Biden's swearing-in. The parade will include performances by Justin Timberlake and Jon Bon Jovi, who have been vocal and active in politics in the past.

In addition to the inauguration events, the Creative Coalition will host a virtual "Inaugural Ball" with celebrities and politicians in attendance. The ball will be live-streamed on social media platforms, allowing Americans to participate in the celebration from the comfort of their own homes.

"We're thrilled to be a part of this historic moment, and we're excited to bring people together to celebrate the arts and the incoming administration," said Creative Coalition President and CEO Robin Bronk.

The inauguration events will kick off at noon ET on Wednesday, when Biden will be inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States. The virtual nature of the events allows for a wider audience to participate in the celebration, and organizers hope that it will serve as a symbol of American resilience and unity during a challenging time.

"We're proud to be a part of this momentous occasion, and we're excited to help bring people together to celebrate the inauguration of President-elect Biden," said Allen.

Overall, the star-studded inauguration events promise to be an exciting and memorable celebration of American democracy, even in the face of adversity. With its focus on unity and resilience, the inauguration is sure to be a moment that Americans will remember for years to come.
