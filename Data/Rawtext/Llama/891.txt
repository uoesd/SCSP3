Broncos Fans Face a Dilemma in Super Bowl LV: 'Two Evils' and No Clear Choice

As Super Bowl LV approaches, Broncos fans find themselves in a predicament. The Kansas City Chiefs, their AFC West archrivals, are vying for the championship against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, led by none other than Tom Brady, the longtime nemesis of the Broncos.

"It's like choosing between two evils," said Julie Thuis, a diehard Broncos fan. "I don't want to root for the Chiefs, but I also don't want to see Tom Brady win another Super Bowl."

Thuis isn't alone in her frustration. A recent Twitter poll revealed that about a third of Broncos fans refuse to root for either the Chiefs or Tom Brady in the Super Bowl.

"I'm so torn," said Christine Voss, another devoted Broncos fan. "I want to support my division, but I can't stand Tom Brady. He's like the NFL's Voldemort."

Voss isn't the only one who feels that way. Many Broncos fans harbor resentment towards Brady, criticizing his attempt to trademark "Tompa Bay" and labeling him as the enemy.

"I don't think I can bring myself to root for Tom Brady," said Dave DeNovellis, a Broncos fan. "He's been a thorn in our side for too long."

However, some fans are willing to set aside their personal dislike for Brady and prioritize divisional rivalry.

"I'll be rooting for Tampa Bay," said Voss. "I want to see the Chiefs lose, and I don't want to give them the satisfaction of winning the Super Bowl."

Others are taking a more humorous approach to the dilemma.

"I'm rooting for the commercials," joked Cole Wist, a former State Rep. and Broncos fan. "At least they're entertaining."

In the midst of this predicament, some fans are suggesting alternative criteria for choosing whom to support.

"I'm considering team connections to Colorado," said Thuis. "I know it's a stretch, but it's better than choosing between the two evils."

Another option is to root for the underdog.

"I'm pulling for Tampa Bay," said DeNovellis. "They're the underdogs, and I love a good upset."

As the big game approaches, Broncos fans continue to grapple with their difficult decision.

"I don't know what to do," said Wist. "I never thought I'd say this, but I miss the days when the Raiders were our biggest problem."

In the end, the choice may come down to personal preference.

"I'm still undecided," said Thuis. "But I do know one thing – I'll be drinking heavily during the game, regardless of who I'm rooting for."

As the Broncos faithful navigate this difficult dilemma, one question remains: does God exist, and if so, why would He put Broncos fans through this?

"I'm starting to question my faith," joked Voss. "How could a loving God put us in this position?"

The answer, much like the choice between the Chiefs and Buccaneers, may remain a mystery. But one thing is certain – Broncos fans will be glued to their screens on Super Bowl Sunday, hoping for a miracle.
