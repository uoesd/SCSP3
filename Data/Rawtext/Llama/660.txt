Rittenhouse Attorney Claims Self-Defense, Disputes Over Sex Offender Status and Gun Possession

A new twist has emerged in the Kyle Rittenhouse case, with the teenager's attorney arguing that one of the victims was a sex offender who was trying to steal Rittenhouse's gun. Mark Richards, representing Rittenhouse, claims that Joseph Rosenbaum started the altercation with the intention of taking Rittenhouse's firearm, which would support the self-defense claim.

However, Kimberley Motley, the attorney representing Rosenbaum's estate, disputes Richards' theory. Motley asserts that Rittenhouse was the aggressor and that Rosenbaum was simply trying to protect himself.

In addition to the self-defense argument, Richards has also filed a motion to dismiss the gun possession charge against Rittenhouse. The motion argues that Wisconsin law does not apply to the type of rifle Rittenhouse was carrying.

Rittenhouse, now 18, was charged with multiple counts, including reckless homicide and being a minor in possession of a dangerous weapon, after he fatally shot two people and injured another during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rittenhouse had traveled to Kenosha from Illinois amid protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake.

Prosecutors are seeking to introduce evidence of Rittenhouse's prior alleged violent conduct and his links to the far-right group Proud Boys. Richards argues that this evidence is irrelevant to the case and should not be admitted.

The incident has polarized opinions, with some painting Rittenhouse as a white supremacist and others seeing him as a symbol of gun rights. A hearing on the motions is scheduled for Sept. 17, with Rittenhouse's trial set to begin on Nov. 1.

"We believe that Mr. Rosenbaum was a sex offender who was trying to steal Kyle's gun," Richards said in a statement. "This is a clear case of self-defense, and we will vigorously defend Kyle's rights."

Motley, however, disputes this version of events. "There is no evidence to support the claim that Joseph Rosenbaum was a sex offender or that he was trying to steal Kyle's gun," she said. "We believe that Kyle Rittenhouse was the aggressor and that he should be held accountable for his actions."

The motion to dismiss the gun possession charge is based on the argument that Wisconsin law does not apply to the type of rifle Rittenhouse was carrying. "The law is clear that certain types of rifles are exempt from the state's gun laws," Richards said. "We believe that Kyle's rifle falls under this exemption and that the charge should be dismissed."

Prosecutors, however, argue that Rittenhouse's prior conduct and links to the Proud Boys are relevant to the case. "We believe that this evidence shows a pattern of violent behavior and that it is relevant to the charges against Kyle Rittenhouse," said a spokesperson for the prosecutor's office.

Richards disagrees, saying that the evidence is not relevant and should not be admitted. "We do not believe that Kyle's prior conduct or his associations with the Proud Boys have any bearing on this case," he said. "We will vigorously oppose any attempt to introduce this evidence."

The case has sparked intense debate, with some seeing Rittenhouse as a hero and others viewing him as a dangerous and reckless individual. Regardless of the outcome, the case is likely to have far-reaching implications for gun rights and self-defense laws in Wisconsin and beyond.

In conclusion, the Kyle Rittenhouse case has taken a new turn with the defense team arguing that one of the victims was a sex offender who was trying to steal Rittenhouse's gun, and that Wisconsin law does not apply to the type of rifle Rittenhouse was carrying. The prosecution, on the other hand, is seeking to introduce evidence of Rittenhouse's prior alleged violent conduct and his links to the Proud Boys. The case is sure to continue to generate intense debate and scrutiny as it moves forward.
