Vice President Kamala Harris Announces $1.5 Billion Investment to Strengthen and Diversify U.S. Health Care Workforce

Washington, D.C. - Today, Vice President Kamala Harris announced a $1.5 billion investment to grow and diversify the U.S. health care workforce. This funding will support the National Health Service Corps, Nurse Corps, and Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery programs, and will help address racial and ethnic disparities in health care professions and outcomes.

"We are committed to ensuring that every American has access to quality, affordable health care, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or zip code," said Vice President Kamala Harris. "This investment will help us build a health care workforce that reflects the diversity of our country and addresses the needs of underserved communities."

Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, this initiative will support over 22,700 health care providers, who will provide care to more than 23.6 million patients across the country. The investment is particularly timely, as the U.S. faces a projected shortage of up to 60,000 primary care doctors, dentists, and psychiatrists over the next decade.

To help meet this need, the federal government plans to award $330 million in additional funding for primary care education. This funding is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's broader efforts to center equity in the COVID-19 response.

"We know that the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed longstanding health disparities in our country, and we are committed to addressing these inequities," said Vice President Harris. "This investment is just one part of our comprehensive strategy to ensure that all Americans have access to the health care they need and deserve."

Earlier this year, the Biden-Harris Administration announced $785 million in funding for equity-focused programs and initiatives as part of its COVID-19 response. This latest investment builds on that commitment and demonstrates the Administration's ongoing efforts to prioritize health equity in its policies and programs.

The Presidential COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, which was established by President Biden and Vice President Harris in March 2020, provided recommendations that informed this investment. The Task Force is composed of leaders from a variety of sectors, including health care, education, and civil rights, and is dedicated to ensuring that the COVID-19 response addresses the needs of vulnerable populations.

"We are proud to be taking this important step forward in our efforts to build a healthier, more equitable society," said Vice President Harris. "We look forward to continuing to work with our partners across the country to ensure that every American has access to the quality health care they deserve."

This investment is a critical component of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to strengthen and diversify the U.S. health care workforce. By supporting the National Health Service Corps, Nurse Corps, and Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery programs, the Administration is working to ensure that every American has access to quality, affordable health care, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or zip code.
