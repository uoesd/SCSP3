Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The Struggle for Privacy in the Spotlight

As Prince Harry and Meghan Markle continue to build their new life in California, they have faced a constant barrage of paparazzi attention, with at least eight incidents recorded since their move. The latest photos to surface show Prince Harry with James Corden filming on a tourist bus in L.A. for 'The Late Late Show'. The couple's lawyer, Michael J Kump, has confirmed that they have filed two lawsuits against picture agencies over unsolicited photographs.

One of the most high-profile events featuring the couple was a COVID-safe edition of Carpool Karaoke with James Corden, which included adequate safety measures. However, photographs of the couple have been widely distributed, including images of them in Beverly Hills and with friends David Foster and Katharine McPhee. They were also photographed during a trip that was speculated to be to a dentist.

A lawsuit was filed against picture agency X17 for using a drone to photograph their son, Archie, leading to an apology and settlement from X17. Michael J Kump, the couple's lawyer, stated that the lawsuit aimed to protect their son's privacy and uncover those profiting from illegal actions.

Early in their California stay, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were photographed delivering parcels for Project Angel Food, a charity aiding vulnerable individuals during the lockdown. Other incidents include being photographed near the Beverly Hills mansion they stayed at, loaned by Tyler Perry.

The constant paparazzi attention has raised concerns about the couple's privacy and security. A source close to the couple stated, "They just want to be able to live their lives without being constantly hounded by photographers."
