Fuel Shortages and Panic-Buying Plague Southeast as Colonial Pipeline Shutdown Continues

CLEMMONS, N.C. (AP) – Long lines at gas stations and panic-buying have become the norm in the Southeast as the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline continues to cause fuel shortages and distribution issues. The pipeline, which delivers 45% of the East Coast's fuel, was taken offline due to a cyberattack, prompting concerns over fuel supply.

Government officials and energy analysts have clarified that there is no gasoline shortage, but rather a distribution issue caused by the pipeline shutdown. "It's not a question of supply, it's a question of getting the fuel to the right places," said Jeanette McGee, spokeswoman for the AAA auto club.

Despite these assurances, drivers in North Carolina and other affected states are taking no chances, filling up their tanks at the first sign of availability. "I've never seen anything like this before," said Jamar Gatison, a construction worker and Uber Eats driver who waited in line for over an hour to get fuel. "I'm just trying to make a living, but it's hard to do that when you can't even get gas."

In North Carolina, 28% of gas stations were out of fuel, with some areas like Raleigh-Durham being hit particularly hard, with 72% of stations reporting no fuel available. In response, Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency to ease fuel transportation into the state. "We're working hard to get fuel to areas that need it most," Cooper said in a statement.

The national average price for a gallon of gasoline has risen above $3 for the first time since 2016, with some stations in the Southeast reporting prices over $4 per gallon. The AAA predicts that over 37 million Americans will travel during the Memorial Day weekend, expecting a significant increase in fuel demand.

To mitigate the disruption, officials are seeking alternative transportation routes for fuel. The U.S. government is coordinating efforts to prevent fuel shortages, including allowing certain states to transport overweight loads of fuel. The Department of Homeland Security is also prepared to review Jones Act waiver requests to alleviate fuel shortages.

Landscaper Mair Martinez, who relies on his truck to make a living, is among those feeling the pinch. "I've had to turn down jobs because I can't afford to fill up my tank," Martinez said. "It's really hurting my business."

Johnathan King, an employee at a towing company, has seen the impact firsthand. "We've had to turn away customers because we don't have enough fuel to tow their cars," King said. "It's frustrating, but what can you do?"

White House press secretary Jen Psaki acknowledged the challenges posed by the pipeline shutdown, but expressed confidence in the government's ability to address the issue. "We're working closely with state and local officials to ensure that fuel is delivered to areas that need it most," Psaki said. "We're doing everything we can to minimize the impact on the American people."

Despite the challenges, some are finding ways to make the best of the situation. "I never thought I'd say this, but the gas shortage has been a blessing in disguise," said Jamar Gatison, the Uber Eats driver. "I've met some great people while waiting in line, and it's forced me to be more mindful of my fuel usage. Maybe this is just what we needed to slow down and appreciate the little things."
