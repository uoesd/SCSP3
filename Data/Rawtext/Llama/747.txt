New Mexico Judge Orders Assistant Director Dave Halls to Be Interviewed in 'Rust' Movie Set Death Investigation

SANTA FE, N.M. – A New Mexico judge has ordered assistant director Dave Halls to be interviewed by state workplace safety regulators as part of their investigation into the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the movie "Rust." Halls handed Alec Baldwin the prop gun that resulted in Hutchins' death on October 21 at the Bonanza Creek Ranch film set near Santa Fe.

The Occupational Health and Safety Bureau of the state Environment Department issued the subpoena for Halls' interview, which he had previously declined two times, citing the ongoing criminal investigation. However, District Judge Bryan Biedscheid granted the subpoena request on Friday, stating that Halls' testimony is crucial to the investigation due to his role in set safety and his handling of the gun.

Rebecca Roose, deputy cabinet secretary of the Environment Department, emphasized the importance of Halls' testimony. "We need to understand the facts and circumstances surrounding this tragic event to ensure that something like this never happens again," she said.

Lisa Torracco, attorney for Dave Halls, confirmed that her client will cooperate with the investigation. "We will comply with the court's order and assist the Occupational Health and Safety Bureau in their investigation," she said.

Alec Baldwin, who was the actor handling the gun when it discharged, has also cooperated with the investigation. He previously stated that he was unaware the gun contained a live round, highlighting the need to identify who loaded the weapon.

The investigation into Hutchins' death is ongoing, with no charges filed yet. The incident has raised concerns about safety protocols on movie sets and the use of prop guns.

In a statement, the Environment Department said, "The Occupational Health and Safety Bureau is committed to conducting a thorough investigation to ensure that workplaces in New Mexico are safe for all employees. We appreciate the court's ruling and look forward to conducting the interview with Mr. Halls."

The interview with Halls is scheduled to take place on a yet-to-be-determined date. The investigation is expected to take several more weeks to complete.
