Qatar Diplomat: Kabul Airport Reopening Uncertain, Taliban Promises to Allow Freedom

KABUL, Afghanistan – The future of Kabul's airport remains uncertain, according to Qatar's top diplomat, as experts from Qatar and Turkey work to reopen the vital transportation hub following the U.S. withdrawal. The Taliban, now in control of Afghanistan, have pledged to allow women and girls to go to school and people to travel freely, but their previous rule was marked by severe oppression, particularly towards women.

"It's unclear when the Kabul airport will reopen for flights," said Mohammad bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatari Foreign Minister, in a statement. "We are working closely with our Turkish colleagues and the Taliban to ensure the safety and security of the airport, but it's a complex process."

The airport's closure has hindered the escape of those fearing the Taliban and delayed humanitarian aid, adding to the urgency of the situation. Despite this, Qatar remains hopeful and engaged in dialogue with the Taliban to restart airport operations.

"We are committed to helping the people of Afghanistan and will continue to work with the Taliban to find a solution," said Al Thani.

In Herat, dozens of women protested for their rights, including participation in the Taliban's Cabinet. Friba Kabrzani, the organizer of the protest, emphasized the importance of tangible action from the Taliban.

"We want the Taliban to show us that they are serious about their promises," said Kabrzani. "We will continue to protest and demand our rights until we see real change."

Maryam Ebram, a protest participant, echoed Kabrzani's sentiments. "We will not be silenced," said Ebram. "We will continue to fight for our rights, no matter what."

The Taliban's previous rule in the late 1990s was marked by severe oppression, particularly towards women. Women were not allowed to work or attend school, and were forced to wear burqas in public. The Taliban's recent promises of freedom and equality have been met with skepticism by many, who fear that their rule will be a return to the oppressive policies of the past.

A recent suicide bombing during evacuation efforts killed 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members, highlighting the danger and uncertainty of the situation. Despite this, the Taliban have pledged to allow women and girls to go to school and people to travel freely, and have promised to be more inclusive and open than in their previous rule.

Dominic Raab, UK Foreign Secretary, emphasized the need for engagement with the Taliban to verify their promises. "We must engage with the Taliban to ensure that they follow through on their commitments," said Raab. "The international community must work together to support the people of Afghanistan and ensure that their rights are protected."

Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkish Foreign Minister, echoed Raab's sentiments. "We must work together to support the people of Afghanistan and ensure that their rights are protected," said Cavusoglu. "We will continue to work closely with our Qatari colleagues and the Taliban to find a solution to the airport closure and ensure the safety and security of the people of Afghanistan."

As the situation in Afghanistan continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the future of the country and the rights of its people remain uncertain. The international community must continue to engage with the Taliban and push for tangible action on their promises, while the people of Afghanistan continue to fight for their rights and demand a better future.
