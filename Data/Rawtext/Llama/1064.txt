Gabby Petito Disappearance: Witnesses Describe Argument at Jackson Hole Restaurant

JACKSON, Wyo. – The disappearance of Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old woman from Florida, has sparked a massive investigation and search efforts across several states. Petito was last seen in a restaurant in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, had an argument with the staff.

According to witnesses Nina Celie Angelo and Matthew England, who were in town for a wedding, Laundrie's behavior was described as "aggressive" and involved a dispute over the bill or money. Petito apologized for Laundrie's behavior during the incident, which occurred on August 27.

"I was sitting at the bar, and I heard a commotion coming from the back of the restaurant," Angelo said in an interview with FOX 13 News. "I turned around, and I saw Brian Laundrie yelling at the staff. He was being really aggressive and demanding. Gabby was trying to calm him down, but he wasn't having it."

England, who was also at the restaurant, described Laundrie's behavior as "erratic" and said that Petito appeared "visibly upset."

"I could tell that Gabby was uncomfortable and trying to defuse the situation," England said. "She apologized to the staff and tried to calm Brian down, but he just wouldn't listen."

The incident at the Merry Piglets Tex-Mex restaurant occurred just two days after Petito's final Instagram post and weeks after a domestic fight between the couple was reported in Utah.

Bodycam footage from a Moab, Utah police response matches the observed behavior of Petito and Laundrie. The couple was recognized from their behavior at the restaurant and from the police bodycam footage.

Gabby Petito's disappearance followed soon after the restaurant incident, with her remains found later in a campsite north of Jackson Hole. Brian Laundrie returned home to Florida without Petito on September 1 and retained a lawyer. He has refused to speak with police.

North Port police spokesperson Josh Taylor confirmed that the department is investigating Laundrie's behavior at the restaurant and its potential connection to Petito's disappearance.

"We are aware of the incident at the restaurant and are looking into it as part of our investigation," Taylor said. "We are also working with law enforcement in Wyoming to gather more information and piece together the timeline of events leading up to Gabby's disappearance."

The search for Petito has now expanded to several states, including Wyoming, Utah, and Florida. The FBI has also joined the investigation.

"We are doing everything we can to find Gabby and bring her home safely," Taylor said. "We urge anyone with information about her disappearance to come forward and contact us immediately."

As the investigation continues, the public is asked to remain vigilant and report any sightings of Petito or Laundrie to the authorities.

"We appreciate the public's help in spreading the word and bringing attention to this case," Taylor said. "We will continue to work tirelessly until we find Gabby and bring her home to her family."

Anyone with information about Petito's disappearance is urged to contact the North Port Police Department at (941) 429-7300 or the FBI's tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324).
