Harris Discusses American Rescue Plan, Job Retraining, and Vaccine Distribution in Exclusive Interview

HUNTINGTON/CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) – In an exclusive interview with WSAZ's Amanda Barren, Vice President Kamala Harris discussed the challenges facing the region amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and the Biden Administration's plans to address them.

Harris highlighted the American Rescue Plan (ARP), a comprehensive package aimed at providing financial assistance to Americans, including $1,400 stimulus checks. The plan also includes measures for small business support, education funding, eviction and foreclosure moratoriums, and extended unemployment benefits.

When asked about concerns over job losses in the coal, oil, and gas industries, Harris suggested retraining for workers towards reclaiming abandoned land mines and plugging oil and gas leaks. "We're not only focused on creating jobs, but also addressing the climate crisis," Harris emphasized.

Legislation opposing President Biden's executive orders on energy, the POWER Act, was introduced by House Republicans and Senator Shelley Moore-Capito. Harris addressed these concerns, assuring that the administration's focus is on creating jobs while addressing climate change, without negatively affecting existing leases.

Concerns were also raised about vaccine distribution based on state population, especially for states like West Virginia with efficient vaccination but small size. Harris highlighted the aim to vaccinate everyone, with an initial goal of 100 million vaccinations in the administration's first 100 days. "We're working to ensure that every American has access to the vaccine, regardless of where they live," Harris said.

The ARP also aims to address child poverty, exacerbated by the pandemic and resulting unemployment. Harris called for unity, stating that though the administration is Democratic, they serve all Americans, regardless of political affiliation. "We're not just serving one group of people, we're serving all Americans," Harris emphasized.

In conclusion, Harris reiterated the administration's commitment to addressing the challenges facing the region, including job losses, vaccine distribution, and child poverty. "We're working tirelessly to ensure that every American has access to the resources they need to thrive," Harris said.

Senator Shelley Moore-Capito commented on the POWER Act, stating, "We must ensure that any energy policy changes made by the Biden Administration do not harm the livelihoods of West Virginians who work in the energy sector."

Vice President Kamala Harris added, "We're not only focused on creating jobs, but also addressing the climate crisis. We're working to ensure that every American has access to the vaccine, regardless of where they live."
