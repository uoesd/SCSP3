Gabby Petito's Disappearance Not Connected to Moab Double Homicide, Police Say

North Port Police Department – The investigation into the disappearance of Gabrielle "Gabby" Petito continues, with police stressing that her case is not related to the double homicide in Moab, Utah, involving Kylen Schulte and Crystal Turner.

Petito, 22, was last in contact with her family in late August 2021, while on a cross-country trip with her fiance, Brian Laundrie. Laundrie returned to Florida alone on September 1 and is considered a person of interest in Petito's disappearance, according to North Port Police Chief Todd Garrison.

"We understand the concerns and speculation regarding the recent homicides in Moab, but we have no evidence to suggest that Gabby's disappearance is connected to that case," Garrison said in a statement.

Schulte, 24, and Turner, 38, were found shot to death near Moab on August 18, with their bodies discovered by authorities after friends reported them missing. The Grand County Sheriff's Office has said there is no connection between Petito's disappearance and the double homicide.

Petito and Laundrie visited Moab in mid-August, and police responded to a domestic problem between the couple on August 12. No charges were pressed following the incident, but the couple was separated for the night by police.

Schulte had mentioned a "creepy man" near their campsite to friends, fearing for their safety. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this person is connected to Petito's disappearance or the double homicide.

A $10,000 reward is being offered for information related to the Schulte-Turner double homicide case, with authorities urging anyone with information to come forward.

Meanwhile, North Port Police and the FBI continue to investigate Petito's disappearance, with Laundrie remaining a person of interest.

"We understand the public's concern and fascination with this case, but we urge everyone to remember that Gabby is still missing and her family is suffering," Garrison said. "We need to keep the focus on finding her and bringing her home safely."

Anyone with information regarding Petito's disappearance is urged to contact the North Port Police Department at (941) 429-7300.

In a statement, Laundrie maintained his innocence, saying, "I am not involved in Gabby's disappearance and I am cooperating fully with the investigation."

As the search for Petito continues, police are urging the public to remain vigilant and report any sightings or information that may be relevant to the case.

"We appreciate the public's help in spreading the word about Gabby's disappearance and we will continue to follow every lead until we find her," Garrison said.

The investigation into Petito's disappearance remains ongoing, with police working tirelessly to bring her home safely.
