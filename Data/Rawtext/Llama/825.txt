Cruz's Amendment to Block Illegal Immigrants from Stimulus Checks Faces Opposition

Senator Ted Cruz's proposed amendment to prevent illegal immigrants from receiving $1,400 stimulus checks as part of the American Rescue Plan has been met with opposition from Senator Dick Durbin. The amendment was rejected, with Durbin arguing that the claim about illegal immigrants receiving stimulus checks was not true.

Cruz claimed that illegal immigrants with Social Security numbers, such as those who overstayed visas, would be eligible for stimulus checks. However, Durbin's aide criticized the assumption that all visa overstayers have Social Security numbers eligible for stimulus checks and highlighted that such conditions apply to previous stimulus packages as well.

The American Rescue Plan allows anyone paying taxes in the U.S. as a resident, including non-citizens with Social Security numbers, to be eligible for stimulus payments. Unauthorized immigrants are defined as foreign-born non-citizens living in the U.S. without legal residence. Visa overstayers retain their Social Security numbers, making them potentially eligible for stimulus checks if they pay taxes.

According to a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, overstaying a visa technically renders someone illegal. In 2019, there were 676,422 visa overstays, with student visas showing the highest overstay rate.

Senator Cruz defended his amendment, stating, "It's simple common sense that people who are here illegally shouldn't receive taxpayer-funded benefits." However, Durbin argued that the amendment was not necessary, saying, "We've been through this before. This is a political stunt."

Durbin's aide also pointed out that legal permanent residents and those passing the substantial presence test qualify as legal residents and are eligible for the stimulus payment.

The issue of illegal immigration has long been a contentious one in the U.S., with many arguing that those living in the country without legal residence should not be eligible for government benefits. However, others argue that those who contribute to the economy through taxes should be entitled to receive stimulus payments.

In conclusion, while Senator Cruz's amendment aimed to prevent illegal immigrants from receiving stimulus checks, it was rejected due to opposition from Senator Durbin and others. The issue remains a point of contention in the ongoing debate over immigration reform.
