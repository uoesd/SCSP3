Derek Chauvin Convicted of Murder in George Floyd's Death; Faces Up to 40 Years in Prison

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – A jury has convicted former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. The conviction carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, but experts predict Chauvin is unlikely to receive the maximum sentence.

Under Minnesota law, Chauvin will only be sentenced for the most serious charge, second-degree murder. The state's sentencing guidelines suggest a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years for someone with no criminal record, like Chauvin. However, prosecutors are seeking an "upward departure" from the guidelines, citing aggravating factors such as Floyd's vulnerability and the presence of children during the crime.

"The guideline range is 12 1/2 years, but the state is asking for an upward departure, which could potentially double that sentence," said Mary Moriarty, a former Hennepin County chief public defender.

Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a statement, "We are seeking an upward departure because we believe that the defendant's conduct was particularly egregious and that the victim was particularly vulnerable."

Mark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, explained that the upward departure sentence should not exceed double the guideline range. "The expectation is that the sentence will be somewhere between 12 1/2 years and 25 years," he said.

Ted Sampsell-Jones, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, added, "The judge will consider a variety of factors, including the severity of the crime, the defendant's criminal history, and any mitigating or aggravating factors."

Chauvin can expect to serve two-thirds of his sentence in prison with good behavior, the rest potentially on supervised release. Both defense and prosecution will submit briefs on aggravating factors, which will influence Judge Cahill's sentencing decision. A pre-sentence investigation report, typically including personal history and the offense's impact, will also be considered in the sentencing.

It's uncertain if Chauvin will speak at his sentencing hearing, due to the potential impact on an appeal. "It's a strategic decision that will depend on the specific circumstances of the case," said Moriarty.

The sentencing hearing is scheduled for later this year, and Chauvin remains in custody until then. The conviction and sentencing process have been closely watched by the community, with many calling for justice for George Floyd.

"This case has brought attention to the need for police reform and accountability," said Ellison. "We hope that this conviction and sentence will be a step towards healing and justice for the Floyd family and the community."

The death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, sparked widespread protests and a national conversation about systemic racism and police brutality. Chauvin's conviction is seen as a step towards holding law enforcement accountable for their actions.

"This case is a reminder that police officers are not above the law," said Osler. "They must be held accountable for their actions, just like any other citizen."

The sentencing of Derek Chauvin will be a significant moment in the pursuit of justice for George Floyd and his family. The community will be watching closely as the legal system holds Chauvin accountable for his actions.

"The Floyd family has shown incredible strength and courage throughout this process," said Sampsell-Jones. "We hope that the sentencing will bring them some measure of closure and justice."
