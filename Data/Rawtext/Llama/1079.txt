Gabby Petito Missing: Boyfriend Brian Laundrie Not Cooperating with Investigation

Gabrielle "Gabby" Petito, a 22-year-old woman from North Port, Florida, has been missing for over a week, and her family is desperate for answers. Petito was on a cross-country trip with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, when she disappeared. Laundrie, who has been identified as a person of interest in the case, has refused to cooperate with the investigation, leaving Petito's family and law enforcement with many unanswered questions.

According to Josh Taylor, a spokesperson for the North Port Police Department, Laundrie and the van they were traveling in were located at his family's home in North Port, but he is not providing any information about Petito's whereabouts. "We're still trying to get information from Brian Laundrie, but he's not being very cooperative," Taylor said.

Steven P. Bertolino, P.C., a lawyer representing Laundrie's family, released a statement saying that they are "remaining in the background" and hope for Petito's safe return. However, Bertolino's statement did not address why Laundrie returned alone or provide any information about Petito's last known location.

Petito's family is urging Laundrie to come forward with any information he may have. "We just want to know where Gabby is and why Brian returned alone," said Nicole Schmidt, Petito's mother. "We're worried sick, and we just want her home safe and sound."

The investigation into Petito's disappearance has involved multiple law enforcement agencies, including the North Port Police Department, the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office, and the FBI. Detectives from Suffolk County Police Department in New York, where Petito is from, are leading the investigation.

Taylor confirmed that there are no obvious signs of foul play in the van, but investigators are still processing evidence and following up on leads. "We're doing everything we can to find Gabby and bring her home to her family," he said.

Petito's last known contact with her family was on August 25, during a Facetime call with her mother. The couple had been documenting their travels on social media, with the last post from Petito appearing on August 25.

The North Port Police Department has found the van, but Taylor said there is no definitive information of a crime happening in North Port. "We're still investigating and following up on leads, but we don't have any concrete evidence of a crime at this point," he said.

The investigation is ongoing, and law enforcement is urging anyone with information about Petito's disappearance to come forward. "We're asking anyone who may have seen Gabby or Brian during their trip to contact us," Taylor said. "We need all the help we can get to find Gabby and bring her home safe and sound."

As the search for Petito continues, her family and friends are holding onto hope that she will be found soon. "We're staying positive and praying for the best outcome," said Schmidt. "We just want Gabby back home where she belongs."
