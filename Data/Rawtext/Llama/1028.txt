H-E-B Temporarily Closes Stores, Reduces Hours Due to Winter Storm Uri

H-E-B, a popular grocery store chain in Texas, has announced that it is temporarily closing some stores and reducing operating hours due to Winter Storm Uri. The storm has brought record cold temperatures, power outages, and water shortages to millions of Texans, causing severe disruptions to the food supply chain.

Affected areas include the greater Houston area, North East region, Gulf Coast, Austin, Central Texas, and San Antonio. Most stores are opening at 9 or 10 a.m. and closing around 5 to 7 p.m., with pharmacy hours aligning with store hours. However, some stores have closed in Austin, Central Texas, and San Antonio due to extreme weather conditions.

H-E-B has taken steps to conserve energy and help preserve the Texas energy grid, which has been strained due to the storm. The company has also implemented purchase limits at some locations to ensure that all customers have access to essential items.

Supply chain disruptions have led to limited product assortments at some stores, and online grocery services, including curbside and home delivery, have been suspended. H-E-B describes Winter Storm Uri as an unprecedented event causing severe disruptions to the food supply chain.

The company is closely monitoring local conditions and will adjust store hours and operations accordingly. Customers are advised to check the H-E-B website or mobile app for up-to-date information on store hours and availability.

In addition to H-E-B, other grocery stores and retailers have also been affected by the storm. Some have closed temporarily, while others have reduced hours or implemented purchase limits.

The Texas Department of Transportation has advised residents to avoid traveling unless absolutely necessary, as road conditions in many areas are hazardous. The agency has also set up emergency shelters for those in need.

The storm has also had a significant impact on the state's agriculture industry, with many farmers and ranchers experiencing losses due to the extreme cold. The Texas Department of Agriculture has activated its emergency response plan to assist affected producers.

In response to the storm, Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of emergency and activated the Texas Emergency Management Plan. The governor has also requested federal assistance to help with response and recovery efforts.

As the storm continues to impact Texas, residents are being reminded to stay safe and take necessary precautions to protect themselves and their families. This includes staying indoors, conserving energy, and avoiding travel unless absolutely necessary.
