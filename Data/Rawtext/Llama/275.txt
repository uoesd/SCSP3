Biden Administration Leads Global Efforts to End Pandemic and Improve Health Security

Washington, D.C. - Today, President Biden hosted the Global COVID-19 Summit, a virtual gathering of world leaders alongside the UN General Assembly, to focus on ending the pandemic and improving global health security. The summit aimed to accelerate progress towards vaccinating the world, saving lives, building back better, and holding the world accountable through measurable targets.

During the summit, President Biden announced that the United States will donate an additional half-billion Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines to low and lower-middle-income countries, bringing the total U.S. commitment to over 1.1 billion doses. This donation represents a significant step towards achieving the summit's objective of vaccinating the world.

In addition to the vaccine donation, the Biden Administration plans to provide additional funding through USAID and the CDC to enhance global vaccine readiness and delivery. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is also committing over $383 million in political risk insurance to facilitate global vaccine shipments.

To boost production capacity for developing countries, the U.S. has made investments in vaccine manufacturing facilities in Africa and India. The summit emphasized the importance of expanding global and regional production of COVID-19 vaccines and enhancing transparency about vaccine availability.

The Biden Administration reiterated its support for a temporary waiver of intellectual property protections under the WTO's TRIPS Agreement for COVID-19 vaccines. This waiver would allow for greater collaboration and knowledge-sharing among vaccine manufacturers, enabling them to produce more vaccines, faster.

To mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 and strengthen health systems, USAID and CDC will provide nearly $1.4 billion in funding. This support will help countries address the pandemic and prepare for future health crises.

The Global COVID-19 Summit highlighted the urgent need for global cooperation in addressing the pandemic. The summit's objectives and outcomes demonstrate the Biden Administration's commitment to working with international partners to end the pandemic and improve global health security.

In his remarks, President Biden emphasized that the pandemic has exposed weaknesses in global health systems and underscored the need for sustained investment in health security. He called on world leaders to take action and make concrete commitments to end the pandemic and prevent future health crises.

The Global COVID-19 Summit marks a significant step forward in the global response to the pandemic. The Biden Administration will continue to work with international partners to ensure that vaccines are available to all, strengthen health systems, and promote global health security.
