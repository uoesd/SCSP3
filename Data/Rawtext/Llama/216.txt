Gas Shortage Hits Pensacola, Florida, as Colonial Pipeline Shutdown and EPA Standards Impact Supply

PENSACOLA, Fla. – A gas shortage has gripped the Pensacola, Florida area, leaving many fuel pumps covered and lines stretching around blocks at stations that still have gas. The shortage has been linked to the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline, which was hit by a ransomware attack, and a truck driver shortage, according to the Florida Department of Agriculture.

Nikki Fried, Commissioner of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS), highlighted the failure of a local fuel terminal in Pensacola to meet Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards, further impacting the supply. "We are working closely with the EPA to address this issue and ensure that gasoline is available to the people of Pensacola," Fried said.

The EPA has confirmed that they are seeking more information regarding the situation and are working closely with FDACS to resolve the issue.

The shortage has caused concern among residents, with Tieisha Brown, a Pensacola resident, expressing worry about the potential impacts on personal safety. "I'm worried about how this will affect my ability to get to work and take care of my family," Brown said.

Officials are urging residents not to panic buy or hoard gas to prevent worsening the shortage. "We understand that this is a difficult situation, but we urge everyone to remain calm and not engage in panic buying," said a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Agriculture. "This will only make the situation worse and could lead to further shortages."

The Colonial Pipeline, which supplies gasoline to much of the southeastern United States, was shut down last week due to a ransomware attack. While Florida largely ships in its gas, the pipeline shutdown could drive up prices, according to AAA.

The shortage has also highlighted the ongoing issue of a truck driver shortage, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic. "The truck driver shortage has been a problem for some time, and it's only getting worse," said a spokesperson for the Florida Trucking Association. "We need to find ways to attract and retain more drivers to ensure that our supply chain remains strong."

In the meantime, residents are being urged to conserve gas and use alternative modes of transportation when possible. "We are working hard to address this issue and ensure that everyone has access to the gas they need," said Fried. "We appreciate the public's cooperation and patience during this time."

The gas shortage in Pensacola is a reminder of the fragility of our supply chain and the importance of being prepared for unexpected disruptions. As officials work to resolve the issue, residents are being encouraged to stay informed and take steps to minimize their impact.
