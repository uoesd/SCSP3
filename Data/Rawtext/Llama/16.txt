Biden Arrives in Washington D.C. Ahead of Inauguration, Security Concerns Prompt Chartered Flight

WASHINGTON (AP) – President-elect Joe Biden arrived in Washington D.C. on Tuesday evening, one day before his inauguration as the 46th president of the United States. Biden flew into Joint Base Andrews on a chartered plane, a departure from the government plane used by President Donald Trump in 2017.

The change in travel plans was prompted by security concerns, according to Biden's team. The president-elect had originally planned to travel by Amtrak, but the chartered flight was deemed a safer option.

Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are scheduled to attend a COVID-19 memorial on Tuesday evening, honoring the lives lost to the pandemic. After the memorial, Biden will spend the night at Blair House, the presidential guest house.

In a farewell address in Delaware, Biden emphasized his connection to the state, saying he would always be a proud son of Delaware. "I'll always be a Delawarean, and I'll always be grateful for the people of this state," he said.

Meanwhile, security preparations for the inauguration were underway, with 12 Army National Guard members removed from their duties after vetting by the FBI found extremist views or ties to right-wing militias. Gen. Daniel Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard, said in a statement, "We take any type of extremism very seriously, and we're taking appropriate action to address it."

In his farewell address, President Donald Trump stated he prayed for the success of the next administration, but did not specifically mention Biden. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, accused Trump of provoking the Capitol attack, saying, "The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president and other powerful people."

As the inauguration approaches, three new Democratic senators are set to be sworn in, giving Democrats a majority in the Senate. The new senators are Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, and Alex Padilla of California.

Despite the security concerns and political tensions, no specific plot against Biden was found as reasons for the removal of the two National Guard members. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies have been working to ensure the safety of the inauguration, with thousands of personnel deployed to secure the area.

The inauguration is set to take place on Wednesday, January 20, with Biden and Harris scheduled to take their oaths of office at noon. The ceremony will be attended by dignitaries and guests from around the world, as well as thousands of Americans who have flocked to the nation's capital to witness the historic event.

As Biden prepares to take office, he faces a daunting task, with the country still reeling from the pandemic and political divisions running deep. But the president-elect has expressed optimism about the future, saying in his farewell address, "I know we can do great things. We just have to remember who we are."
