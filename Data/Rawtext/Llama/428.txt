Biden: Chauvin Conviction a Step Forward in Fight Against Systemic Racism

WASHINGTON (AP) – President Joe Biden on Tuesday hailed the conviction of former police officer Derek Chauvin in the killing of George Floyd as a step forward in the fight against systemic racism, but emphasized that the struggle for justice and policing reform is far from over.

"The conviction of Derek Chauvin is a step forward, but it's not enough," Biden said in a statement. "We must continue to work towards a future where the justice system is fair and equitable for all Americans."

Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris urged Congress to pass the George Floyd policing reform bill, which aims to address issues of racial bias and excessive force in law enforcement. Harris, the first Black woman vice president, spoke on the impact of racism on the country's potential and the promise of justice for all.

"The conviction of Derek Chauvin is a necessary step, but it is not a sufficient step," Harris said. "We must continue to confront hatred and systemic racism in all its forms, and we must work towards a future where every American can live with dignity and safety."

The conviction of Chauvin, who was found guilty of two counts of murder and one of manslaughter, came after the jury deliberated for about 10 hours over two days. Biden had earlier expressed hope for "the right verdict" while the jury was sequestered, a comment that drew attention.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Biden watched the verdict with a mix of emotions, including relief and a renewed sense of purpose to address policing racism.

"The President's reaction was one of relief, but also a recognition that this is just one step in a long journey towards justice and reform," Psaki said.

Biden interacted with Floyd's family, offering comfort and seeing Floyd's death as a world-changing event.

"The President spoke with the Floyd family and offered his condolences and support," Psaki said. "He also reiterated his commitment to working towards a future where every American can live with dignity and safety."

The aftermath of the verdict presents a challenge for Biden, who aims to address policing racism while maintaining support for law enforcement. Responses to the verdict included relief and a renewed push for policing reform legislation among lawmakers from both parties.

Senator Tim Scott, a Black Republican from South Carolina, said that the conviction was a step towards justice, but that more work needs to be done.

"The conviction of Derek Chauvin is a step towards justice, but it's not the end of the road," Scott said. "We must continue to work towards a future where every American can live with dignity and safety."

Representative Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia, echoed Scott's sentiments.

"The conviction of Derek Chauvin is a necessary step, but it's not sufficient," Johnson said. "We must continue to work towards a future where every American can live with dignity and safety."

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, said that the conviction was a victory for justice, but that more work needs to be done to address policing racism.

"The conviction of Derek Chauvin is a victory for justice, but it's not the end of the fight," Pelosi said. "We must continue to work towards a future where every American can live with dignity and safety."

Brock Hunter, a criminal defense attorney and past president of the Minnesota Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said that the verdict was a step towards accountability, but that more work needs to be done to address policing racism.

"The conviction of Derek Chauvin is a step towards accountability, but it's not the end of the road," Hunter said. "We must continue to work towards a future where every American can live with dignity and safety."

Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over the trial, said that the verdict was a step towards justice, but that more work needs to be done to address policing racism.

"The verdict is a step towards justice, but it's not the end of the fight," Cahill said. "We must continue to work towards a future where every American can live with dignity and safety."

In conclusion, the conviction of Derek Chauvin in the killing of George Floyd is a step forward in the fight against systemic racism, but the struggle for justice and policing reform is far from over. Biden and Harris emphasized the need to confront hatred and systemic racism beyond legal reforms, and urged Congress to pass the George Floyd policing reform bill. The aftermath of the verdict presents a challenge for Biden, who aims to address policing racism while maintaining support for law enforcement. Responses to the verdict included relief and a renewed push for policing reform legislation among lawmakers from both parties.
