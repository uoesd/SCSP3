Fuel Pipeline Restarts, but Shortages Persist Across Southeast

CLEMMONS, N.C. (AP) – Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, has restarted operations following a hacker-induced shutdown that led to widespread gas shortages, panic-buying, and long lines at gas stations across the Southeast.

According to Colonial Pipeline, it will take several days for fuel deliveries to normalize. The cyberattack did not allow hackers to control pipeline operations, but the company shut down the pipeline to contain the damage.

The restart of the pipeline is expected to address the transportation issue affecting fuel supply to gas stations. However, it may take some time for the fuel to reach all areas, and some stations may still experience shortages.

Over half of the gas stations in North Carolina and about half in Georgia and Virginia ran out of fuel, according to Jeanette McGee, spokeswoman for AAA auto club. "It's been chaotic, to say the least," she said.

The fuel disruption occurred as Americans are becoming more mobile, especially with pandemic restrictions easing. "People are eager to get out and travel, and this couldn't have come at a worse time," said Jamar Gatison, a construction worker and Uber Eats driver.

In response to the shortages, several U.S. agencies relaxed rules to expedite fuel transport via trucks, trains, and ships, despite a national trucker shortage. "We're doing everything we can to get fuel to where it's needed," said Ron Brown, operator of Ron's Appalachian Trail Shuttles.

The national average price for a gallon of gasoline surpassed $3 for the first time since 2016, according to AAA. "It's a double whammy – not only are people struggling to find gas, but it's also getting more expensive," said Mary Goldburg, a T-shirt and promotional products deliverer.

The fuel shortages have also led to incidents of violence and price gouging. "It's unfortunate that some people are taking advantage of the situation," said Jeff Lenard, spokesman for the National Association of Convenience Stores.

Ryan McNutt, CEO of the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America, urged consumers to remain patient. "We're working hard to get fuel to where it's needed, but it's going to take some time," he said.

In the meantime, some people are finding creative ways to cope with the shortages. "I've been carpooling with my neighbors and using public transportation when I can," said Sarah Johnson, a college student. "It's not ideal, but it's better than sitting in line for hours."

The Colonial Pipeline shutdown has highlighted the vulnerability of the nation's energy infrastructure to cyberattacks. "This is a wake-up call for all of us," said McGee. "We need to take steps to protect our critical infrastructure from these kinds of threats."

For now, the focus is on getting fuel to where it's needed. "We're doing everything we can to address the shortages and get life back to normal," said Brown.

As the fuel begins to flow again, people across the Southeast are breathing a sigh of relief. "It's been a tough few days, but we'll get through this," said Gatison. "We always do."
