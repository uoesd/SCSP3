COVID-19 and HIV: A Deadly Double Threat

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill, but for those living with HIV, the risk of infection and death is significantly higher. Tulio de Oliveira, Director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation at Stellenbosch University, is urging for greater attention to be paid to the interactions between COVID-19 and HIV.

De Oliveira warns that failure to provide COVID-19 vaccines to high HIV rate nations risks greater danger and the emergence of coronavirus variants. "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of individuals with HIV, who are 30-50% more likely to die from COVID-19, with greater risk in those with advanced HIV," he says.

The pandemic has also caused drug shortages and treatment challenges for those with HIV. Prolonged infections in immunocompromised individuals, like those with advanced HIV, can lead to concerning coronavirus variants. Sub-Saharan Africa is significantly affected due to high HIV prevalence and insufficient antiretroviral therapy coverage.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare, reduced HIV testing, and affected prevention programs. Africa lags in COVID-19 vaccine access, with less than 7% fully vaccinated compared to the global 40%. The COVAX initiative, aimed at distributing two billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021, is falling short of its goal.

De Oliveira emphasizes the need to simultaneously tackle COVID-19 and HIV, potentially benefiting global health. "We must address the intersection of these two diseases to prevent further suffering and death," he stresses.

The call to action is clear: the international community must work together to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are available to all, particularly those in high HIV prevalence countries. This is not only a matter of global health, but also a human rights issue.

As de Oliveira notes, "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses in our healthcare systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We must learn from this crisis and work towards a more equitable and sustainable future for all."

The fight against COVID-19 and HIV is not a zero-sum game. By addressing the intersection of these two diseases, we can create a safer and healthier world for everyone. It's time for the global community to take action and prioritize the health and well-being of all individuals, regardless of their HIV status.
