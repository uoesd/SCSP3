Biden Inaugurated as 46th President, Vows to Unite a Divided Nation

Washington CNN – January 20, 2021

With heightened security and COVID-19 precautions in place, President Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States on Wednesday, without the presence of outgoing President Donald Trump.

Trump left the White House for the last time as president, expressing it was a "great honor" to serve. In a brief farewell address at Joint Base Andrews, he thanked his family and chief of staff, and wished the incoming administration "great luck" without naming Biden.

Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris attended morning services at Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle with their families and Congressional leaders. Harris made history as the first female, first Black, and first South Asian vice president of the United States.

Biden, sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts using a family Bible, pledged to be a "president for all Americans". In his inaugural address, he emphasized the need to come together as a nation and address the challenges facing the country, including the COVID-19 pandemic, economic inequality, and climate change.

The inauguration featured performances by Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, Garth Brooks, and poet Amanda Gorman. Gorman, the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history, delivered a powerful poem that highlighted the diversity and resilience of the American people.

Biden signed his first presidential documents, including an Inauguration Day Proclamation and nominations. He also participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery with former presidents, including Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton.

In his first actions as president, Biden signed over a dozen executive actions targeting Trump's legacy, including orders to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, and to rescind the travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries. He also emphasized respect among White House staff, saying, "I want to make it clear that we will not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or intimidation in this administration."

Trump's absence from the inauguration was a break with tradition, as outgoing presidents have typically attended the ceremony to symbolize the peaceful transfer of power. Melania Trump, the former first lady, also did not attend, citing COVID-19 concerns.

Despite Trump's absence, Biden extended an olive branch to his predecessor, saying, "I want to thank my predecessor, Donald Trump, for his service. I know we have our differences, but I believe we can work together to find common ground and move forward as a nation."

The inauguration was attended by thousands of people, including lawmakers, celebrities, and ordinary Americans. Many in the crowd wore masks and followed social distancing guidelines, reflecting the ongoing efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

Biden's inauguration marked a new chapter in American politics, as the country looks to move beyond the divisiveness and polarization of the past four years. The president's call for unity and cooperation was echoed by many in attendance, who expressed hope for a brighter future under the new administration.

As Biden and Harris took office, they faced a daunting array of challenges, from addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and economic inequality to tackling climate change and racial injustice. But with a renewed sense of purpose and a commitment to working together, the American people are ready to face these challenges head-on and build a better future for all.
