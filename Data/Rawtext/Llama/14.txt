Biden Sworn in Safely, Security Concerns Persist

WASHINGTON (AP) – Joe Biden was safely sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on Wednesday, amid heightened security concerns following a previous attack by rioters loyal to Donald Trump.

The inauguration took place under the watchful eye of law enforcement, who monitored far-right extremist and militia groups for potential threats. Despite the heavy security presence and the deployment of over 25,000 troops and police, there were only a few scattered arrests and no major protests.

Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, expressed relief that the inauguration went off without a hitch. "We were prepared for any contingency, but thankfully, everything went smoothly," he said.

The National Mall was closed to the public, with extensive checkpoints set up to ensure the safety of attendees. Federal agents were wary of concerning online chatter and possible infiltration attempts, but their efforts proved effective in preventing any major security breaches.

QAnon followers, a group known for promoting conspiracy theories, expressed disappointment online as their predictions of a coup or military takeover did not materialize.

In an unprecedented security effort, the FBI vetted all 25,000 National Guard members deployed to the inauguration. Twelve members were removed from their duties due to extremist statements or ties to right-wing militias.

The heightened security measures in Washington, D.C., are expected to remain in place for several days post-inauguration, as a precautionary measure.

President Biden thanked the security personnel for their efforts in a statement, saying, "I am grateful for the tireless work of our law enforcement and military personnel who ensured the safety and security of today's inauguration. Their dedication and professionalism are a testament to the strength and resilience of our democracy."

The inauguration ceremony itself was attended by a smaller-than-usual crowd due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and security concerns. However, the mood was jubilant, with attendees celebrating the peaceful transfer of power and the start of a new era in American politics.

In a sign of the times, the inauguration was heavily guarded against potential threats, with sniper teams stationed on rooftops and military vehicles patrolling the streets. However, the security measures did not dampen the spirits of those in attendance, who were eager to witness a moment of hope and renewal for the nation.

As President Biden takes office, he faces a daunting array of challenges, from the ongoing pandemic to economic inequality and climate change. However, the peaceful inauguration ceremony and the lack of major security incidents are seen as a positive sign for the future.

In a statement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell congratulated President Biden and expressed a willingness to work together to address the nation's challenges. "We may have our differences, but we are all Americans, and we all want what's best for our country," he said.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed McConnell's sentiments, saying, "We look forward to working with President Biden to build a better future for all Americans."

As the inauguration ceremony came to a close, a sense of relief and hope filled the air. The peaceful transfer of power, a hallmark of American democracy, had been upheld, and a new chapter in the nation's history had begun.

Despite the ongoing challenges and security concerns, the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States marked a moment of renewal and optimism for a nation eager to move forward.
