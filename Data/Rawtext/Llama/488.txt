Power Struggles Persist in Louisiana 9 Days After Hurricane Ida's Devastation

LaPLACE, La. – Hundreds of thousands of Louisianans are still grappling with the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, with power restoration efforts lagging behind in many communities, sparking frustration and despair.

"It's unacceptable that we're nine days in and we still don't have power," said State Rep. Tanner Magee, the House's second-ranking Republican. "We need to see a sense of urgency from our utility companies."

In the hardest-hit parishes, Ochsner Health's two hospitals are operating emergency rooms but are not fully open, according to Warner Thomas, President and CEO of Ochsner Health. "We're doing everything we can to get back up and running, but it's a slow process," he said.

Meanwhile, the state has revoked the licenses of seven nursing homes after seven residents died in post-Ida conditions. "We will not tolerate substandard care for our most vulnerable citizens," said a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Health.

In a bid to alleviate the suffering, Carnival Glory has docked in New Orleans to house first responders. "We're grateful for the support from Carnival Cruise Line," said Michael Lathers, a resident of LaPlace. "It's a small ray of hope in a time of great need."

However, the state is still struggling with fuel shortages, water service intermittency, and uninhabitable homes due to Ida's destruction. "It's a slow and painful process, but we're doing everything we can to help our communities recover," said Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana President and CEO.

According to FEMA, about 3,200 people are still in mass shelters, while 25,000 are in FEMA hotel rooms for transitional sheltering. Additionally, a total of 159,000 household applications for disaster assistance have been approved by FEMA.

Entergy is making progress on power restoration, but some areas may not have power until the end of September. "We understand the frustration, but we're working around the clock to get the lights back on," said May.

The death toll from Ida in Louisiana has risen to 15, with additional fatalities due to injury and lack of oxygen during the power outage. "It's a tragic reminder of the devastating impact of this storm," said Kim Bass, a resident of St. John the Baptist Parish.

As the recovery efforts continue, residents are holding on to hope that their lives will soon return to normal. "It's a tough time, but we're strong and resilient," said Michael Lathers. "We'll get through this together."
