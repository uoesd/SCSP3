Stimulus Debate Continues in Washington D.C. as Families Receive Child Tax Credit Payments

BALTIMORE (WBFF/WKRC) – As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect families across the country, a debate is raging in Washington D.C. about whether to provide additional stimulus money to American families. Previous COVID stimulus payments have included amounts of $1,200, $600, and $1,400, with the last signed by President Biden in March 2021.

One form of relief that has been provided to families is the expanded federal Child Tax Credit, which was included in the American Rescue Plan. This provision provides direct payments to families, with $300 for each child under 6 and $250 for each child ages 6 to 17, between July and December of 2021. A family with one child under 6 will receive $1,800 by December 2021 through the advanced payments.

In addition, families not normally filing a tax return could still benefit if they notified the IRS by November 15. These eligible families will receive half of their total Child Tax Credit in a single payment on December 15. The potential one-time payments are up to $1,800 for each child under 6, and up to $1,500 for each child ages 6 to 17.

The future of the expanded Child Tax Credit is uncertain, with the Biden administration aiming to make it permanent. However, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin has expressed a desire to make changes to the Child Tax Credit payments.

The debate over additional stimulus money and the future of the Child Tax Credit comes as families continue to struggle with the economic impacts of the pandemic. Many have seen their incomes reduced or have lost their jobs altogether, making it difficult to pay for basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare.

While the expanded Child Tax Credit has provided some relief, many families are still struggling to make ends meet. The debate in Washington D.C. will continue to be closely watched by families across the country who are hoping for additional support during this difficult time.

In conclusion, the debate over stimulus money and the future of the Child Tax Credit is an important one that will have a significant impact on families across the country. As the pandemic continues to affect families, it is crucial that policymakers consider the needs of those who are struggling and work towards providing adequate support.
