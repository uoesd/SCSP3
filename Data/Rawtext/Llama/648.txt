Rittenhouse's friend, Dominick Black, pleads not guilty to providing rifle used in Kenosha shootings

Dominick Black, the 19-year-old man accused of providing the AR-15-style rifle used by Kyle Rittenhouse in the fatal shootings of two protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Black faces two counts of providing a dangerous weapon to someone under 18, resulting in death, with each count potentially carrying a three-year prison sentence.

Black's attorney, Anthony Cotton, filed a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that the law has been misinterpreted in this case. Cotton claims that the rifle was purchased for Rittenhouse to use on private property and was stored in Kenosha by Black's stepfather. Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shootings, used the rifle in August to fatally shoot two protesters and wound a third, claiming self-defense.

Wisconsin law prohibits adults from providing firearms to minors, with certain exceptions for supervised activities. Cotton argues that the law's exceptions and specifications do not apply because Rittenhouse was not hunting. "The law is clear that minors are not allowed to possess firearms, but there are exceptions for hunting and other supervised activities," Cotton said. "Since Rittenhouse was not hunting, the law does not apply in this case."

In addition to the motion to dismiss, Cotton has also challenged the charging of two counts for the same weapon transfer, citing double jeopardy concerns. Judge Bruce Schroeder indicated agreement on the multiplicity issue and will likely issue a ruling in writing by June.

Federal authorities are also considering charges against Black for straw purchasing the rifle, which could result in up to 10 years in prison. A straw purchase occurs when an individual purchases a firearm for someone who is not legally allowed to possess one.

Cotton argues that Black's actions do not constitute a straw purchase, as he was not aware that Rittenhouse was planning to use the rifle for illegal purposes. "My client did not know that Rittenhouse was going to use the rifle to harm anyone," Cotton said. "He thought he was just storing it for him, and he had no reason to believe otherwise."

The case against Black and Rittenhouse has sparked controversy and debate over gun laws and the use of deadly force in self-defense. While some argue that Rittenhouse was justified in using the rifle to protect himself and others, others argue that he should not have had access to the weapon in the first place.

As the case moves forward, the outcome could have significant implications for gun laws and the responsibility of individuals who provide firearms to minors. For now, Black remains free on bond as he awaits his next court date.

In conclusion, the case against Dominick Black and Kyle Rittenhouse highlights the complexities of gun laws and the consequences of providing firearms to minors. While the outcome is still uncertain, it is clear that this case will have a lasting impact on the community and the state of Wisconsin.
