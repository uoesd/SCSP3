South Carolina Man Charged with Federal Crimes for Role in Capitol Riot

A South Carolina man, Andrew Hatley, has been charged with federal crimes for his participation in the January 6th riot at the United States Capitol building in Washington D.C. Hatley faces charges including entering a restricted building without authority and impeding government business.

According to a statement released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Hatley was identified through a combination of witnesses, photographs, and a cellphone tracking app. The FBI used the 'Life360' location-tracking app to verify Hatley's presence at the Capitol building during the riot. A witness also provided the FBI with photographs of Hatley inside the building, including a selfie he took in front of a statue of John C. Calhoun.

Agent Don Wood, spokesperson for the FBI's Columbia field office, confirmed that the office had no substantial involvement in Hatley's investigation. "The FBI's Columbia field office was not directly involved in the investigation of Andrew Hatley," Wood said. "The investigation was led by the FBI's Washington D.C. field office, with assistance from other federal agencies."

Hatley was contacted by federal authorities on January 12th, and criminal charges were filed against him on January 15th. He is one of over 200 people who have been charged in connection to the riot, which resulted in five deaths.

In a Facebook post that has since been taken down, Hatley denied any involvement in breaching the Capitol building. "I was not part of any group that stormed the Capitol," Hatley wrote. "I was simply in the area to exercise my right to free speech and assembly."

Despite his denials, Hatley's presence at the Capitol building during the riot has been well-documented. In addition to the photographs and eyewitness accounts, Hatley's cellphone location data also places him at the scene of the crime.

The charges against Hatley are serious, and if convicted, he could face significant fines and imprisonment. Entering a restricted building without authority is a federal offense punishable by up to one year in prison, while impeding government business carries a maximum sentence of 20 years.

The FBI has been working tirelessly to identify and charge those responsible for the violence and destruction that occurred during the Capitol riot. "We are committed to holding those responsible accountable for their actions," said Agent Wood. "We will continue to work with our federal partners to ensure that justice is served."

The investigation into the Capitol riot is ongoing, and additional charges are expected to be filed in the coming weeks. As the investigation progresses, it is clear that those who participated in the riot will face severe consequences for their actions.

In conclusion, the charges against Andrew Hatley serve as a warning to those who would seek to engage in violent or destructive behavior in the name of political protest. The FBI and other federal agencies are committed to protecting the safety and security of all Americans, and those who break the law will be held accountable.
