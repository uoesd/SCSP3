Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Royal Exit Finalized

LONDON (AP) – Buckingham Palace has confirmed that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will not return to their royal duties, with Harry relinquishing his honorary military titles and the couple losing their patronages. The decision finalizes the couple's separation from royal family duties, a year after they stepped away in March 2020.

According to a statement issued by the palace, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Harry had a conversation in which they discussed the impossibility of continuing with public service responsibilities. As a result, Harry will no longer hold his honorary military titles, including his position as Captain General of the Royal Marines.

Meghan will also lose her patronages, including her role as patron of Britain's National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities. However, the palace emphasized that the couple remains much-loved members of the family despite their decision.

The decision comes after Harry and Meghan moved to North America, citing media intrusions and racist attitudes as their reason for leaving. They retain their Duke and Duchess titles but will no longer use 'royal highness' or receive public funds for royal duties.

Angela Levin, a biographer of Prince Harry, said that the couple's decision was not surprising, given their desire for a more private life. "They've made it clear that they want to have a different kind of life, and that's not compatible with being working members of the royal family," she said.

Despite their departure from royal duties, the couple's spokesperson emphasized their ongoing commitment to duty and service. "They will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty and the royal family, and will work towards a more peaceful and charitable world," the spokesperson said.

The couple's decision has sparked a mixed reaction from the public, with some expressing sadness at their departure and others supporting their desire for a more private life.

In a statement, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked the couple for their service and expressed his support for their decision. "I understand their desire for a more private life, and I wish them all the best in their future endeavors," he said.

The couple's departure from royal duties marks the end of an era for the royal family, but their commitment to duty and service remains unwavering. As they embark on their new path, they will undoubtedly continue to make a positive impact on the world.

In conclusion, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision to step away from royal duties marks a significant change for the royal family, but their commitment to service and duty remains unwavering. As they embark on their new path, they will continue to be much-loved members of the family and will undoubtedly make a positive impact on the world.
