Joint Chiefs Condemn Capitol Insurrection, Warn Troops Against Impeding Inauguration

In a rare and powerful statement, the eight members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have condemned the January 6, 2021 riot at the US Capitol, describing it as a direct assault on the US Congress, the Capitol building, and the Constitutional process. The statement, signed by all eight military leaders, emphasized that the rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not justify violence, sedition, and insurrection.

The letter, addressed to all US military members, serves as a stern warning against any actions that could impede the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. The Joint Chiefs reminded service members that any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is against the law and goes against the principles of the apolitical nature of the armed services.

The statement comes in response to the involvement of some veterans and possibly active-duty troops in the Capitol attack, which has raised concerns about the politicization of the military. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Army Gen. Mark Milley and the other chiefs felt compelled to address the issue to maintain the integrity and impartiality of the armed forces.

Historically, the Joint Chiefs tend to speak out on highly egregious matters, and this statement marks a significant moment in the military's stance on political issues. The letter reaffirmed the military leaders' commitment to supporting and defending the Constitution and the forthcoming inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th Commander in Chief.

The statement reads, in part, "The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not justify violence, sedition, and insurrection. The Constitution and laws of the United States provide the framework for the peaceful transfer of power, and any act to disrupt this process is against the law and against the principles of the apolitical nature of the armed services."

The Joint Chiefs emphasized that the military's role is to support and defend the Constitution, not to take part in political movements or agendas. They reminded service members that their duty is to uphold the law and protect the rights of all Americans, regardless of their political beliefs.

The statement also acknowledged the sacrifices made by service members and their families, and the importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of the American people. The Joint Chiefs expressed their gratitude for the service and dedication of all military members and reiterated their commitment to upholding the highest standards of integrity and professionalism.

In conclusion, the statement by the Joint Chiefs serves as a powerful reminder of the military's role in upholding the Constitution and the rule of law. It also underscores the importance of maintaining the apolitical nature of the armed services, and the responsibility of service members to uphold the highest standards of integrity and professionalism.

As the nation prepares for the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, the Joint Chiefs' statement sends a clear message that any actions that violate the Constitution or disrupt the peaceful transfer of power will not be tolerated. The military leaders' commitment to upholding the law and protecting the rights of all Americans is a testament to the enduring strength and resilience of the US democracy.
