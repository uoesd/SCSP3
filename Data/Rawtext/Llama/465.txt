Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Skip Trooping the Colour Ceremony Amid COVID-19 Restrictions

LONDON, UK - Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were conspicuously absent from this year's Trooping the Colour ceremony, which took place on Saturday, June 12. The couple, who recently welcomed their baby girl, Lilibet, joins a list of other notable absences, including Kate Middleton and Prince William.

The Queen's Official Birthday Parade, as Trooping the Colour is officially known, is typically a grand celebration in central London, with large gatherings of royal family members on the balcony. However, due to COVID-19 restrictions, this year's event was scaled down, with only two royals in attendance: the Queen and her cousin, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent.

The palace had announced in March that the event's traditional format would be altered due to the pandemic, following consultations with Government and other relevant parties. The reduced attendance is part of efforts to minimize the risk of transmission and ensure the safety of all involved. Despite the changes, the ceremony still maintained its pomp and pageantry, with the Queen and Prince Edward taking part in the traditional balcony appearance.
