Kyle Rittenhouse, Acquitted in Kenosha Shootings, Says He's Not Racist, Supports BLM

New York – Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old who was acquitted of all charges related to the shootings during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has spoken out about his case, insisting he's not a racist and supports the Black Lives Matter movement.

In an interview with Tucker Carlson set to air on Fox News, Rittenhouse said the case was about the right to self-defense, not race. "I'm not a racist, I support peaceful demonstrations," Rittenhouse said, according to a preview of the interview released by Fox News.

Rittenhouse, who is white, as were the men he shot, emphasized that his actions were not motivated by racial hatred. "I don't care about race, I care about people," he said. "I believe in the Black Lives Matter movement, I believe in peaceful protests."

A spokesman for the Rittenhouse family, David Hancock, described Kyle as caring, empathetic, and civic-minded. "Kyle is a young man who cares deeply about his community and the people in it," Hancock said. "He's always been passionate about social justice and supports the Black Lives Matter movement."

Rittenhouse was 17 when he traveled to Kenosha, which had been rocked by protests following the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer. During his trial, Rittenhouse argued he fired in self-defense after being attacked.

Despite being photographed with members of the Proud Boys, a far-right group known for its anti-progressive views, Rittenhouse's attorneys deny he is a white supremacist. "Kyle is not a member of any hate group, and he rejects any ideology that promotes hatred or violence," Hancock said.

Rittenhouse's acquittal has sparked controversy, with some seeing it as a warning sign for Black communities about "vigilante justice." NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson views the trial result as a "warning shot" for Black communities. "The acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse is a clear example of the double standard of justice in America," Johnson said in a statement. "It's a warning shot to Black communities that vigilante justice is alive and well."

Rittenhouse's case has been a focal point for debates on Second Amendment rights and protests against police brutality. His acquittal has sparked protests and calls for justice, with many arguing that Rittenhouse's actions were motivated by racial hatred.

However, Rittenhouse maintains that his actions were not racially motivated. "I don't see race, I see people," he said in the interview with Tucker Carlson. "I believe in the Black Lives Matter movement, I believe in peaceful protests. I'm not a racist, I'm a human being."

Rittenhouse's attorneys have also emphasized that their client's actions were not motivated by racial hatred. "Kyle Rittenhouse is not a racist, and his actions were not motivated by racial animus," attorney John Pierce said in a statement. "He is a young man who cares deeply about his community and the people in it."

The Rittenhouse family has also released a statement, expressing their gratitude for the acquittal and emphasizing their son's commitment to social justice. "We are grateful for the jury's decision, and we believe that justice has been served," the statement read. "Kyle is a caring and empathetic young man who supports peaceful protests and the Black Lives Matter movement."

The acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse has sparked a national conversation about race, justice, and the role of vigilante justice in American society. While Rittenhouse maintains that his actions were not racially motivated, many critics argue that his actions were a manifestation of systemic racism and a symptom of a broader problem in American society.

Regardless of one's opinion on Rittenhouse's actions, it is clear that the case has highlighted the deep divisions and tensions that exist in American society. As the nation continues to grapple with issues of race, justice, and inequality, the Rittenhouse case serves as a powerful reminder of the need for constructive dialogue and meaningful change.
