Biden Visits Louisiana to Assess Hurricane Ida's Devastation, Promises Infrastructure Improvements

U.S. President Joe Biden traveled to Louisiana on Tuesday to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Ida, which left one million people without power and another 600,000 without water in the state. During his visit, Biden met with Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards and local officials to discuss the hurricane's impact and the need for infrastructure improvements.

"We're going to do everything we can to help you recover," Biden told Edwards and other officials during a meeting in Baton Rouge. "We're going to make sure that we build back better than before."

Ida, which made landfall in Louisiana on Sunday as a Category 4 hurricane, is the fifth most powerful storm to hit the United States, causing extensive damage and power outages along the Gulf Coast. The death toll from the storm includes at least nine in Louisiana and at least 46 along the East Coast.

Power restoration efforts in Louisiana have reduced the number of homes and businesses without power to around 823,000, but many residents are still without electricity and running water. In New Jersey, the death toll from Ida's impacts rose to 25, with at least six people still missing.

Biden toured damage in Louisiana communities such as LaPlace, where he saw firsthand the destruction caused by the storm's high winds and flooding. He emphasized the need for infrastructure improvements, such as burying power lines underground to prevent future outages.

"We're going to invest in infrastructure that can withstand the impacts of climate change," Biden said. "We can't keep rebuilding the same way we've been building. We have to build back better, stronger, and more resilient."

Biden's infrastructure plan, which he announced earlier this year, includes investments in burying power lines underground, as well as other measures to improve the nation's infrastructure and make it more resilient to extreme weather events.

In addition to his visit to Louisiana, Biden also approved an emergency declaration for New Jersey and New York, providing federal assistance for response efforts. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy thanked Biden for his support, saying that the state is "grateful for the federal government's assistance during this difficult time."

U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, also praised Biden's visit, saying that it shows the president's commitment to helping the state recover from the storm.

"President Biden's visit to Louisiana is a clear sign that he is committed to helping our state recover from Hurricane Ida," Cassidy said. "We appreciate his support and look forward to working with him to ensure that our state gets the resources it needs to rebuild and recover."

Overall, Biden's visit to Louisiana highlighted the need for infrastructure improvements and the importance of federal support in times of crisis. As the nation continues to grapple with the impacts of climate change, it is clear that investing in resilient infrastructure will be critical to protecting communities from extreme weather events.
