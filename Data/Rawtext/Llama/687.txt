Oxford High School Shooting Leaves Four Dead, Seven Wounded; 15-Year-Old Suspect Faces Adult Charges

A shooting at Oxford High School in Michigan has left four students dead and seven others wounded, including a teacher. The alleged shooter, 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, is facing charges as an adult, including first-degree murder and terrorism.

According to Prosecutor Marc Keast, Ethan Crumbley fired at least 30 shots in a premeditated attack. His lawyer, Scott Kozak, entered a not-guilty plea on his behalf.

Ethan's parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, were charged with involuntary manslaughter and arrested after missing their arraignment. James Crumbley purchased the gun used in the shooting shortly before the incident, and Ethan posted about it on social media.

School officials were warned about Ethan Crumbley's concerning behavior, including a search for ammunition online and a disturbing drawing found on his desk. Despite the warnings, Ethan was allowed to return to class the day of the shooting with the gun in his backpack.

During the shooting, Ethan allegedly walked the hallways of the school, shooting students in a methodical manner before being detained by police. Students and teachers barricaded themselves, using objects as potential weapons for self-defense during the shooting.

"I was in class when I heard the shots," said Zander Cumbey, a student at Oxford High School. "We all hid under our desks and waited for the police to come."

Ethan Crumbley's parents contacted authorities and their son via text upon realizing the situation, but he was already in police custody by then.

"We are deeply saddened by the loss of life and the impact this has had on our community," said Tim Throne, Superintendent of the Oxford High School District. "We will continue to work with law enforcement to ensure the safety of our students and staff."

The shooting has sparked outrage and calls for action to prevent such incidents in the future.

"This is a tragic reminder of the devastating consequences of gun violence," said Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald. "We must do everything in our power to prevent these senseless acts from occurring."

The investigation is ongoing, with authorities working to determine the motive behind the shooting.

"We are still trying to understand why this happened," said Lieutenant Tim Willis of the Oakland County Sheriff's Office. "We will leave no stone unturned in our search for answers."

As the community grapples with the aftermath of the shooting, students and staff are being offered counseling services to help them cope.

"This is a difficult time for everyone involved," said Sheriff Michael Bouchard of Oakland County. "We will do everything we can to support the victims and their families."

The shooting at Oxford High School serves as a stark reminder of the devastating impact of gun violence and the need for action to prevent such incidents in the future.
