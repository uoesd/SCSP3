Democrats Push for Swift Impeachment Proceedings Against Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) – Democrats in Congress are moving quickly to impeach President Donald Trump following the Capitol siege, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasizing the need for immediate action against an "unhinged" president.

"The President's actions demonstrate his absolute disregard for the safety and well-being of the American people," Pelosi said in a statement. "We cannot allow him to remain in office."

Pelosi has discussed preventing Trump from initiating military hostilities or accessing nuclear launch codes with Gen. Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. She has also been considering invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, though this seems unlikely following resignations in the Cabinet.

The draft impeachment articles accuse Trump of abuse of power related to the Capitol siege. A House vote on impeachment could occur as soon as Wednesday.

Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has criticized Trump, calling for his resignation. "I want him out," she said in a statement. "He's caused enough damage."

White House spokesman Judd Deere has criticized the impeachment efforts as divisive. "The President has done nothing wrong," he said. "This is a political witch hunt."

Twitter has permanently suspended Trump's account, citing "risk of further incitement of violence."

Democratic Representative Adam Schiff of California, who has been a vocal critic of Trump, said the President's actions have left Congress with no choice but to impeach. "The President has betrayed his oath of office," he said. "We must hold him accountable."

Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has also called for Trump's impeachment. "The President's actions are a threat to our democracy," he said. "We must take action to protect the American people."

Trump has promised a smooth transfer of power but will not attend Joe Biden's inauguration, a rare presidential snub.

The impeachment proceedings come as the country remains on high alert following the Capitol siege, which left several people dead and injured. The FBI has warned of further violence and hate groups have been emboldened by Trump's rhetoric.

The impeachment process is expected to be contentious, with Republicans divided on whether to support Trump. Some have called for his resignation, while others have defended his actions.

In a statement, Pelosi said the impeachment proceedings are necessary to protect the country from Trump's "unhinged" behavior. "We cannot allow him to remain in office," she said. "The safety and well-being of the American people depend on it."
