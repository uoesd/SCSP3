CNN's 'Cuomo Prime Time' Viewership Plummets Amid Governor's Scandals

As the public scandals surrounding New York Governor Andrew Cuomo continue to mount, the viewership of CNN's 'Cuomo Prime Time' has seen a significant decline. The show, hosted by Chris Cuomo, has lost nearly 20% of its viewers since the network barred coverage of the governor's scandals.

According to Nielsen Media Research, 'Cuomo Prime Time' averaged 2.2 million viewers when Governor Cuomo was a regular guest on the show. However, after CNN banned Chris Cuomo from covering his brother's scandals, viewership dropped to 1.6 million viewers. This represents a 20% loss in viewership compared to 2020.

The decline is even more pronounced in the key demographic of adults 25-to-54, with a 42% viewership loss. This demographic is crucial for cable news networks, as it represents the age range most likely to engage with political news.

Governor Cuomo is currently embroiled in multiple scandals, including sexual harassment accusations and alleged nursing home death coverups. These scandals have led to increased public scrutiny, which has likely contributed to the decline in viewership for 'Cuomo Prime Time.'

CNN's decision to prevent Chris Cuomo from covering his brother's scandals was communicated in February 2021, citing a longstanding policy with an exception made during the pandemic. The network's decision was met with criticism from some viewers, who felt that Chris Cuomo's relationship to the governor created a conflict of interest.

Chris Cuomo's viewership has suffered significantly since the scandals, with a 30% drop after Lindsey Boylan's accusation of sexual harassment against Governor Cuomo. The host addressed the situation on air, stating that he couldn't cover his brother's scandals due to their relationship.

Public scrutiny increased as Chris Cuomo had previously covered his brother in more favorable times. The network's decision to bar coverage of the governor's scandals has led to criticism from some viewers, who feel that CNN is not providing adequate coverage of the news.

'Cuomo Prime Time' experienced its worst week in 2021 with only 1.2 million viewers. This represents a 30% drop in viewership compared to the same week in 2020.

The decline in viewership for 'Cuomo Prime Time' is a significant blow to CNN, which has long touted the show as one of its flagship programs. The network has not commented publicly on the decline in viewership, but it is clear that the public's perception of Governor Cuomo has had a negative impact on the show's ratings.

As the scandals surrounding Governor Cuomo continue to unfold, it remains to be seen how CNN will address the situation. Will the network continue to bar coverage of the governor's scandals, or will it reconsider its decision in light of the decline in viewership? Only time will tell.

In conclusion, the decline in viewership for 'Cuomo Prime Time' is a direct result of the public scandals surrounding Governor Andrew Cuomo. The network's decision to bar coverage of the governor's scandals has led to a significant loss in viewership, particularly in the key demographic of adults 25-to-54. As the scandals continue to mount, it remains to be seen how CNN will address the situation and whether the show's viewership will recover.
