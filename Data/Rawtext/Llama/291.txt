COVID-19 Booster Shots Set to Become a Multi-Billion Dollar Market

NEW YORK, Aug 13 (Reuters) – As governments around the world begin to offer COVID-19 booster shots to combat the Delta variant, pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna are poised to earn billions of dollars in revenue. The companies have already secured over $60 billion in sales for 2021 and 2022, including initial vaccines and potential boosters, and revenue forecasts for 2023 from boosters alone are over $6.6 billion and $7.6 billion for Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, respectively.

The need for booster shots has been supported by evidence of waning antibody levels and breakthrough infections, but the extent of necessity remains debated. "We believe a third dose will be necessary 6 to 8 months after full vaccination, with regular boosters afterward," said Stephen Hoge, President of Moderna.

Despite the uncertainty on how many people will need boosters and how competition will affect the booster shot market, the market could mimic the flu shot market, with developed country vaccination rates around 50%, and notable competition keeping prices in check. "The COVID booster market could be similar to the flu shot market, with a similar price point and similar competition," said Dave Ross, an executive at CSL's flu vaccine unit Seqirus.

Pfizer and Moderna initially may have greater pricing power for their boosters until more competitors enter the market. "We believe Pfizer and Moderna will have pricing power for their boosters, at least in the short term," said Steve Chesney, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.

However, the U.S. government paying for the shots could prevent price increases, with efforts underway to test mix-and-match booster strategies. "The U.S. government's decision to pay for boosters could help keep prices in check," said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar.

The booster shot market is expected to be a multi-billion dollar market, with Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna set to earn billions of dollars in revenue. "We believe the COVID-19 booster shot market could be a multi-billion dollar market, with Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna set to benefit," said Vamil Divan, an analyst at Mizuho Securities.

Bijan Salehizadeh, Managing Director at Navimed Capital, added, "The booster shot market has the potential to be a significant opportunity for pharmaceutical companies, with Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna well-positioned to capitalize on this market."

In conclusion, the COVID-19 booster shot market is set to become a multi-billion dollar market, with Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna poised to earn billions of dollars in revenue. While the need for boosters remains debated, evidence of waning antibody levels and breakthrough infections support the need for boosters. The market could mimic the flu shot market, with notable competition keeping prices in check, and the U.S. government paying for the shots could prevent price increases.
