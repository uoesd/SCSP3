FDA Authorizes Multiple Tests for Asymptomatic COVID-19 Screening

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken a significant step in the fight against COVID-19 by authorizing several tests for over-the-counter (OTC) use without a prescription for serial screening of asymptomatic individuals. This move aims to assist schools, workplaces, and communities in setting up COVID-19 screening programs.

According to Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, "Screening testing is a critical tool in our efforts to control the spread of COVID-19. These authorizations are part of our ongoing efforts to increase consumer access to testing and support the establishment of screening programs."

One of the tests authorized for point-of-care (POC) setting without a prescription is the Quidel QuickVue test. Another test, the Abbott BinaxNOW, has been authorized for POC use with a prescription. These tests had previously been approved for symptomatic testing but have now been extended for asymptomatic use in serial testing.

The FDA has taken various measures throughout the pandemic to facilitate the development and authorization of COVID-19 tests. The agency has worked closely with test manufacturers, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders to ensure that safe and effective tests are available to the public.

In addition to the Quidel QuickVue and Abbott BinaxNOW tests, the BD Veritor System has also been authorized for serial screening claims. These tests have been shown to meet the FDA's scientific standards for emergency use authorization.

The authorization of these tests for asymptomatic screening is part of the FDA's broader mandate to ensure public health by regulating drugs, medical devices, food supply, and other areas. By offering several options for accurate and reliable screening tests, the FDA aims to support efforts to control the spread of COVID-19.

In conclusion, the FDA's authorization of multiple tests for asymptomatic COVID-19 screening represents a significant step forward in the fight against the pandemic. With these tests, schools, workplaces, and communities can set up screening programs to help identify individuals who may be infected and prevent further spread of the virus. The FDA will continue to work closely with test manufacturers and other stakeholders to ensure that safe and effective tests are available to the public.
