Congressmen Defend Surprise Trip to Kabul Amidst Criticisms

Washington D.C. - Congressmen Peter Meijer (R-MI) and Seth Moulton (D-MA) are defending their surprise trip to Kabul, Afghanistan, amidst criticisms from the White House and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The lawmakers, both veterans, stated that their visit aimed to conduct oversight on the evacuation operation amid the U.S. military withdrawal and Taliban takeover.

"We went to Kabul to see the situation on the ground for ourselves, and to ensure that the evacuation was being conducted in a safe and efficient manner," Meijer said in a statement. "We wanted to minimize the risk and disruption to the people on the ground, which is why we didn't pre-announce our visit."

The White House has claimed that over 100,000 people have been evacuated to safety recently, but Moulton and Meijer stated that their trip aimed to assess the situation firsthand. Moulton highlighted the emotional strain on personnel at Kabul airport and criticized President Biden's preparation for evacuations.

"The President's plan to meet an August 31 deadline for troop withdrawal is unrealistic and dangerous," Moulton said. "We saw firsthand the strain on the military personnel and civilians working tirelessly to evacuate people from Kabul. It's clear that more time is needed to ensure a safe and orderly withdrawal."

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi labelled the trip a dangerous "freelance" journey, and the Biden administration and Pelosi criticized the trip for potentially diverting resources. However, Moulton and Meijer maintained that their visit did not interfere with the evacuation efforts.

"We paid out of pocket for our flights to the United Arab Emirates, and then took military flights to and from Kabul," Meijer said. "We made sure that our visit did not divert any resources away from the evacuation efforts."

Politico reported that the lawmakers paid "out of pocket" for their flights, and a spokesperson for Moulton confirmed that they did not use government funds for the trip.

Despite the criticism, Moulton and Meijer stood by their decision to visit Kabul, emphasizing the importance of conducting oversight on the evacuation operation.

"We have a responsibility as members of Congress to ensure that the evacuation is being conducted in a responsible and safe manner," Moulton said. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely and do everything in our power to support the men and women serving in Afghanistan."

Meijer echoed Moulton's sentiments, stating that their trip was necessary to assess the situation on the ground.

"We cannot rely solely on briefings from the Administration to understand the situation in Afghanistan," Meijer said. "We must see it for ourselves, and that's exactly what we did."

The controversy surrounding the trip comes as the Biden administration faces mounting pressure to extend the August 31 deadline for troop withdrawal. Moulton and Meijer have both stated their opposition to the deadline, citing concerns about the safety of U.S. personnel and Afghan allies.

"The President's plan to withdraw troops by August 31 is a recipe for disaster," Moulton said. "We must take the time necessary to ensure a safe and orderly withdrawal, even if it means extending the deadline."

Meijer echoed Moulton's concerns, stating that the U.S. must prioritize the safety of its personnel and allies.

"We cannot rush the evacuation process and risk the lives of our troops and Afghan allies," Meijer said. "We must take the time necessary to get this right, even if it means extending the deadline."

The controversy surrounding the trip is unlikely to subside in the coming days, as the Biden administration continues to face pressure to extend the deadline for troop withdrawal. However, Moulton and Meijer remain resolute in their decision to visit Kabul, emphasizing the importance of conducting oversight on the evacuation operation.

"We will continue to do everything in our power to support the men and women serving in Afghanistan," Moulton said. "We owe it to them to ensure that the evacuation is conducted in a safe and responsible manner."

Meijer echoed Moulton's sentiments, stating that their trip was necessary to fulfill their duty as members of Congress.

"We have a responsibility to the American people to ensure that the evacuation is being conducted in a responsible and safe manner," Meijer said. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely and do everything in our power to support the men and women serving in Afghanistan."
