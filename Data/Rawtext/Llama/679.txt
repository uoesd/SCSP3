Protesters Demand Justice for Chrystul Kizer, Criticize Rittenhouse Acquittal

Kenosha, WI - Chanting "Justice for Chrystul Kizer" and "No justice, no peace," protesters took to the streets of downtown Kenosha on Saturday to demand accountability for the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse, a militia member who killed three people during a protest in August.

The protest, organized by the Party of Socialism and Liberation, drew dozens of people to Civic Center Park, where they rallied and marched through the city. The demonstration was peaceful, with protesters holding signs and chanting slogans that called for justice for Kizer, a sex trafficking victim who is accused of killing her abuser.

"The system is broken, and it's up to us to fix it," said Jess Singh, a Kenosha resident and member of the Party of Socialism and Liberation. "We need to stand up and fight for justice for Chrystul Kizer, just like we did for Kyle Rittenhouse and Jacob Blake."

State Rep. David Bowen (D-Milwaukee) echoed Singh's sentiments, urging protesters to continue fighting for justice with the same vigor they had shown for Rittenhouse and Blake. "We can't let up now," Bowen said. "We need to keep pushing for systemic change, and we need to make sure that Chrystul Kizer gets the justice she deserves."

Lorna Revere, a Racine resident, emphasized her commitment to social justice and highlighted the significance of Kizer's case. "We can't ignore the fact that Chrystul Kizer is a victim of sex trafficking," Revere said. "We need to stand up for her and make sure that she gets the support and justice she needs."

The rally expressed collective anger and determination to keep fighting for systemic change. Protesters chanted "No justice, no peace" and "Hey, hey, ho, ho, these racist systems have got to go," as they marched through the city.

Bishop Tavis Grant, of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, and Justin Blake, uncle of Jacob Blake, also spoke at the protest, demanding economic consequences for militia supporters and criticizing President Biden's acceptance of the Rittenhouse verdict. "We need to hold these people accountable," Grant said. "We can't let them get away with this."

Rittenhouse's lawyers had argued that he was not a militia member but was protecting property, amidst controversy over his affiliations with far-right symbols. However, many protesters and activists believe that Rittenhouse's actions were motivated by racism and a desire to intimidate and harm protesters.

Rev. Jesse Jackson, who also spoke at the protest, sought a Department of Justice review of the Rittenhouse case, demonstrating broader calls for accountability. "We need to make sure that justice is served," Jackson said. "We can't let these kinds of incidents continue to happen without consequences."

Leaders at the protest expressed dissatisfaction with political responses, particularly from President Biden and Gov. Tony Evers. "We need more than just words," Singh said. "We need action, and we need it now."

The protest in Kenosha was just one of several that took place across the country on Saturday, as activists and community members continued to demand justice for Kizer and an end to systemic racism and police brutality.

As the protest came to a close, protesters vowed to continue fighting for justice and to keep pushing for systemic change. "We won't stop until we get justice," Revere said. "We won't stop until we see change."
