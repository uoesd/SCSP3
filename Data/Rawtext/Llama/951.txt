House Democrats Push for Second Impeachment of President Trump

Washington D.C. - In the aftermath of the violent attack on the Capitol by President Trump's supporters, House Democrats are moving forward with plans to impeach the President for the second time. In a letter to her colleagues, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) cited Trump as an "imminent threat" to democracy and the Constitution, and announced plans to adopt Rep. Jamie Raskin's (D-MD) 25th Amendment resolution, which aims to remove Trump from office due to his inability to discharge the duties of the President.

Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) attempted to discuss the issue with Vice President Mike Pence, but were unable to connect. As a result, they are now pushing for a vote on impeachment as soon as Wednesday. Drafted impeachment charges accuse Trump of inciting violence against the U.S. government.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has indicated that a trial likely wouldn't start before President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, which could impact early Biden administration actions. Biden has not publicly taken a stand on impeachment, choosing to focus on his upcoming agenda instead.

While some Republicans, such as Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE), have shown openness to impeachment, others, including McConnell, have remained silent post-attack. Discussion among lawmakers has also included potentially delaying sending impeachment articles to the Senate to avoid hindering Biden's early presidency.

In addition to impeachment, lawmakers are considering other actions against Trump and his supporters, including censuring the President and taking action against GOP objectors of Electoral College votes, including possible expulsion.

Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC) emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating, "We cannot allow this President to continue to threaten our democracy." Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) echoed his sentiments, saying, "The President's actions are a clear and present danger to our country."

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) expressed his support for impeachment, saying, "The President's actions are unacceptable and he must be held accountable." Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) also backed impeachment, stating, "The President's actions were a betrayal of his oath of office."

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) stressed the importance of holding Trump accountable, saying, "The President's actions are a threat to our democracy and the rule of law." Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) added, "The President's actions are a clear violation of his oath of office and he must be held accountable."

Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) emphasized the need for action, stating, "We cannot stand idly by while the President threatens our democracy. We must take action to protect our country."

As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how many Republicans will support impeachment and what actions will be taken against Trump and his supporters. One thing is certain, however: the events of the past week have forever changed the political landscape of the United States.
