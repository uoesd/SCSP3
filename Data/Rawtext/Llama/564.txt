Afghanistan's Desperate Escape: Chaos, Courage, and Chance at Kabul Airport

As the Taliban advanced on Kabul, the capital city's airport became a symbol of hope and despair for thousands of Afghans trying to escape the country's collapse. A convoy aiming to reach the airport faced hostile Taliban forces, showcasing the desperate attempts for escape amid the Afghan crisis.

Taliban threats and violence intensified as uncoordinated convoys overwhelmed checkpoints, leading to refusals and threats of violence. The fate of individuals trying to escape Kabul often hinged on courage, quick decisions, and sheer chance.

Sara Qaderi, an agricultural scientist threatened by the Taliban, represents the dire situations faced by many Afghans working with the US. "I was told that if I didn't leave, I would be killed," she said.
