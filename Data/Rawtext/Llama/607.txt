Pence Calls Harris, Breaking Ice Between Outgoing and Incoming Admininstrations

WASHINGTON (AP) – In a rare show of comity between the outgoing and incoming administrations, Vice President Mike Pence called Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to offer his congratulations, marking the first known contact between the two sides.

The call, described as a "good call" by a source familiar with the conversation, came as President Donald Trump continues to make baseless claims about voter fraud and refuses to accept the election results. Pence, who has distanced himself from Trump especially after the Capitol siege, has defended Biden's win and will attend his inauguration, unlike Trump who will skip it.

During the call, Pence offered his assistance to Harris and thanked her for her service, according to the source. The call represents a traditional show of comity between outgoing and incoming leaders that Trump has flouted.

President-elect Joe Biden said he would be "honored" to have Pence attend his inauguration, underscoring the importance of maintaining historical precedents for peaceful transfer of power.

Pence has been fulfilling ceremonial duties in the final days of the Trump administration, including thanking National Guard members protecting the Capitol. His call to Harris marks a rare moment of cooperation between the two sides, as Trump has refused to reach out to Biden or invite him to the White House.

The lack of contact between the two administrations has been a departure from tradition, as outgoing presidents typically invite their successors to the White House for a meeting and tour. Pence's call to Harris is a sign that some level of normalcy is being restored, even if it comes from the vice president rather than the president himself.

Trump's refusal to accept the election results and his claims of widespread voter fraud have led to a contentious transition period, with the president and his allies filing lawsuits and making unsubstantiated claims of election rigging. The call between Pence and Harris suggests that at least some level of cooperation is possible, even if it comes from the vice president rather than the president.

The call also highlights Pence's efforts to distance himself from Trump, especially after the Capitol siege, which has led to a rift between the two men. Pence has defended Biden's win and praised the peaceful transfer of power, a departure from Trump's rhetoric.

In the final days of the Trump administration, Pence has been focusing on ceremonial duties, including a visit to the National Guard members protecting the Capitol. His call to Harris represents a rare moment of cooperation between the two sides, and a sign that some level of normalcy is being restored to the transition process.

Overall, the call between Pence and Harris represents a positive step towards a peaceful transfer of power, even if it comes from the vice president rather than the president himself. It remains to be seen whether Trump will follow suit and reach out to Biden before the inauguration.
