Navy Medic from Ohio Killed in Kabul Airport Bombing

KABUL, Afghanistan (WTVG) – A tragic loss has struck the community of Berlin Heights, Ohio, as Navy medic Max Soviak was killed in a bombing at the Kabul airport. Soviak, a 2017 graduate of Edison High School in Milan, Ohio, died alongside 12 other U.S. service members and over 170 Afghans.

ISIS-K, a terrorist organization in Afghanistan, has claimed responsibility for the attack. The U.S. Navy confirmed the death of a sailor, offering condolences without naming Soviak directly.

Edison High School Superintendent Thomas C. Roth described Soviak as a good student and well respected. "Max was a kind and compassionate young man who was always willing to help others in need," Roth said. "He had a heart for serving others, and that's what led him to join the Navy and become a medic."

Ohio Senator Rob Portman expressed heartbreak over Soviak's death, calling him a hero. "Max lost his life helping fellow countrymen and Afghan allies, and his sacrifice will never be forgotten," Portman said.

The local community and schools are mourning the loss of Soviak. "We are deeply saddened by the loss of Max Soviak," said a spokesperson for the Berlin Heights School District. "He was a bright and promising young man who had a passion for serving others. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this difficult time."

The attack on the Kabul airport has sparked outrage and grief across the globe. The U.S. and Afghan governments have vowed to bring those responsible to justice. As the community says goodbye to Soviak, his sacrifice will be remembered and honored.

Rest in peace, Max Soviak.
