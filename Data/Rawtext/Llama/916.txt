The What-If Scenario: Tom Brady and the New Orleans Saints

As the 2020 NFL season came to a close, the New Orleans Saints found themselves once again falling short of their ultimate goal: a second Super Bowl victory. Quarterback Drew Brees, who had been the face of the franchise for over a decade, had decided to return for another season, despite facing a challenging year due to multiple injuries. However, what if Brees had decided to retire a season earlier? Would the Saints have been able to lure in the greatest quarterback of all time, Tom Brady?

According to ESPN reporter Jeff Darlington, Brady was very close to signing with the Saints before ultimately joining the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. "Tom Brady was seriously considering the Saints," Darlington said on ESPN's 'Get Up.' "He was intrigued by the idea of playing for Sean Payton and the Saints' high-powered offense."

Brady's interest in the Saints was significant, but his decision was ultimately influenced by Drew Brees' decision to continue playing. Had Brady joined the Saints, it's likely that key players such as Rob Gronkowski, Antonio Brown, and Leonard Fournette might have followed him. The thought of having Brady, Gronkowski, and Brown on the same team is enough to make any Saints fan salivate.

However, it's impossible to ignore the fact that Brady's health and performance metrics during the season were significantly better than Brees'. Brady threw for over 4,000 yards and 28 touchdowns, while Brees threw for just over 2,000 yards and 17 touchdowns. It's hard not to wonder what could have been possible for the Saints had Brady joined the team.

Of course, this is all just speculation, and we'll never know for sure how things would have turned out. But it's an intriguing thought experiment, to say the least.

With Brady off the table, the Saints turned to Jameis Winston, the former Buccaneers quarterback, as their current solution. While Winston has shown flashes of brilliance, he's also been plagued by inconsistency and injuries. It remains to be seen whether he'll be able to lead the Saints to the promised land.

In the end, the Saints' 2020 season was a disappointment, but the what-if scenario of Tom Brady joining the team will always be a fascinating topic of discussion. For more Saints news and updates, be sure to follow Canal Street Chronicles.
