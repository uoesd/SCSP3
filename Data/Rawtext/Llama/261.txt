Pfizer and BioNTech Announce Positive Phase 2/3 Trial Results for COVID-19 Vaccine in Children Aged 5 to 11

NEW YORK AND MAINZ, Germany – Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced positive top-line results from a Phase 2/3 trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of their COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 5 to 11. The trial showed a favorable safety profile and robust antibody responses with a 10 μg dose regimen, which is identical to the dose authorized for individuals aged 16 and older.

"We are thrilled to share these positive results, which suggest that our COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective in children aged 5 to 11," said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. "The rise in pediatric cases due to the Delta variant highlights the need to extend vaccine protection to children, and we are committed to working with regulatory authorities to make our vaccine available to this age group as soon as possible."

The Phase 2/3 trial enrolled 2,268 participants in the 5 to 11 age group who received two doses of the 10 μg vaccine. The results showed strong immune responses in children, comparable to those in the 16 to 25 age group with the 30 μg dose. The trial also demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no serious adverse events or cases of myocarditis reported.

"We are satisfied with the data and its consistency with results observed in older populations," said Dr. Ugur Sahin, CEO and co-founder, BioNTech. "We believe that our COVID-19 vaccine has the potential to provide protection to children and help prevent the spread of the virus in this vulnerable population."

Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit the data for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States and update the EU Conditional Marketing Authorization. The study is part of a larger trial enrolling children aged 6 months to 11 years to evaluate the vaccine's safety and efficacy.

COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) by Pfizer and BioNTech is FDA-approved for individuals 16 and older and has EUA for those 12 and older, including a third dose for certain immunocompromised individuals. The companies are committed to sharing further phase 3 trial data and aim for regulatory approvals for younger pediatric populations.

"We are committed to continuing our efforts to ensure that our COVID-19 vaccine is available to all populations, including children," said Bourla. "We believe that our vaccine has the potential to make a significant impact in the fight against COVID-19 and protect public health."

Pfizer and BioNTech have been at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19, with their vaccine being the first to receive FDA approval and EUA in the United States and Europe, respectively. The companies have also been working closely with regulatory authorities to make their vaccine available to broader populations, including children.

In conclusion, the positive Phase 2/3 trial results for Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 5 to 11 are a promising development in the fight against COVID-19. The companies are committed to continuing their efforts to make their vaccine available to all populations and help prevent the spread of the virus.
