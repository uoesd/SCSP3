Tiger Woods, the legendary golfer, was involved in a single-car crash near Los Angeles on Tuesday, sustaining serious injuries that required emergency surgery on his right leg. The crash occurred on a notorious stretch of road known for accidents, and Woods' vehicle crossed the center median and rolled over several times.

According to Dr. Anish Mahajan, Interim CEO and Chief Medical Officer at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Woods suffered a comminuted open fracture in his right leg and underwent emergency orthopedic surgery. Woods was later transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for continuing orthopedic care and recovery.
