Ever Given Owner Blames Suez Canal Authority for Ship's Grounding, Contests $916.5m Compensation Claim

The owner of the Ever Given, Shoei Kisen, has placed blame on the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) for the ship's grounding in March, which disrupted global trade by blocking the canal for six days. In response, the SCA has detained the vessel and is seeking a $916.5m compensation claim. The matter is currently being heard at the Ismailia economic court, where Shoei Kisen is appealing against the detention and contesting the SCA's claim.

According to Ahmed Abu Ali, a member of the legal team representing Shoei Kisen, the SCA allowed the ship to enter the canal in bad weather and failed to provide adequate tug boat support. "The SCA's actions do not qualify as a 'salvage operation' under legal definitions, which challenges the basis for compensation," Abu Ali said.

Recordings presented in court showed disagreements among SCA pilots and the control center regarding the ship entering the canal. Despite this, the SCA is seeking compensation for the costs of the salvage operation, which Shoei Kisen argues is unfounded.

In addition to contesting the compensation claim, Shoei Kisen is seeking $100,000 in initial compensation for detention-related losses. The court is expected to make a decision on the case on Sunday.

The grounding of the Ever Given has had significant consequences for global trade, as the Suez Canal is a vital waterway for the transportation of goods. The incident has highlighted the risks associated with navigating the canal, particularly in bad weather conditions.

The SCA has maintained that the ship's grounding was caused by a combination of factors, including high winds, a dust storm, and the ship's speed. However, Shoei Kisen argues that the SCA's negligence and failure to provide adequate support contributed to the incident.

The legal battle between Shoei Kisen and the SCA has been ongoing since the ship's grounding in March. The outcome of the case could have significant implications for the shipping industry, as it may set a precedent for future incidents involving the Suez Canal.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the SCA said, "The Suez Canal Authority is committed to ensuring the safe and efficient passage of ships through the canal. We are confident that the court will find in our favor and that the compensation claim will be upheld."

However, Shoei Kisen remains adamant that the SCA is responsible for the ship's grounding and should not be seeking compensation. "We believe that the SCA's actions were not in line with international maritime law and that they have failed to provide adequate support for ships passing through the canal," Abu Ali said.

The case is being closely watched by the shipping industry, as it could have significant implications for the future of trade through the Suez Canal. A decision in favor of Shoei Kisen could lead to changes in the way the SCA operates and potentially impact the authority's ability to seek compensation in similar incidents.

In conclusion, the legal battle between Shoei Kisen and the SCA is ongoing, with a decision expected on Sunday. The outcome of the case will have significant implications for the shipping industry and could potentially set a precedent for future incidents involving the Suez Canal.
