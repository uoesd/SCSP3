Trump Falsely Claims Supporters Were "Hugging and Kissing" Police During Capitol Riot

Washington CNN – Former President Donald Trump has sparked outrage with his latest comments on the January 6 Capitol riot, falsely claiming that his supporters were "hugging and kissing" police during the violent insurrection. Trump's remarks are an attempt to rewrite the history of the event, despite overwhelming evidence of violence and five deaths.

In an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, Trump criticized the beefed-up security at the US Capitol as "disgraceful" and a "political maneuver." He then suggested that some rioters should face repercussions, but quickly drew a false equivalency by attacking Antifa, a left-wing activist group.

"They were hugging and kissing the police," Trump claimed. "They were hugging and kissing the Secret Service. They were hugging and kissing the Capitol Police."

However, Trump's "hugging and kissing" remark ignores the overall violence that occurred during the riot. Over 100 police officers were injured, and five people died as a result of the chaos. Criminal complaints against riot participants show the severity of the threats against lawmakers, with some accused of plotting to kill or harm members of Congress.

Trump's comments have been met with widespread criticism, with many accusing him of downplaying the violence that occurred during the riot. Democratic lawmakers have filed lawsuits against Trump, accusing him of stoking the riot with his baseless claims of election fraud. Trump denies any responsibility for the violence.

Ingraham pressed Trump on whether people who commit crimes should be prosecuted, to which he agreed. However, Trump's comments suggest that he does not believe his supporters were responsible for the violence that occurred during the riot.

The mob that stormed the Capitol aimed to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's win in the 2020 election. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the election was "stolen" from him, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

Trump's attempts to rewrite the history of the Capitol riot come as he faces increasing scrutiny for his role in the violence. The House of Representatives has impeached Trump for inciting the insurrection, and his trial is set to begin in the Senate next month.

In conclusion, Trump's claims that his supporters were "hugging and kissing" police during the Capitol riot are a clear attempt to downplay the violence that occurred. The evidence shows that the riot was a violent and dangerous event, with many participants intent on harming lawmakers and disrupting the democratic process. Trump's comments are a disservice to the victims of the riot and a threat to the rule of law.
