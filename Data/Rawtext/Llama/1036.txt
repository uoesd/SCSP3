Cold Snap in Texas Expected to Drive Up Gas Prices in Rockford and Nationwide

ROCKFORD – A cold snap in Texas is expected to increase gas prices by 10 cents to 20 cents in Rockford and nationwide, according to Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. The cold has affected oil production, with 20% of the nation's refining capacity down.

All 254 counties in Texas were under a winter storm warning, bringing freezing temperatures. As a result, 11 refineries in Texas and one in Kansas have partially shut down due to the cold. This has led to a decrease in oil production, which in turn is expected to drive up gas prices.

DeHaan stated, "The cold weather has caused a significant decrease in refining capacity, which will lead to higher prices at the pump." He added, "The situation is likely to worsen in the coming days as refineries take longer to return to full service."

The average price of gas in Illinois is currently $2.77 per gallon, up from $2.48 last year. The increase in gas prices is also attributed to the annual switch to summer-blend gasoline. According to DeHaan, "The switch to summer-blend gasoline typically leads to a 10-cent to 20-cent increase in gas prices."

Gas prices in Rockford could reach an average of $3 per gallon by Memorial Day. Refineries may take up to two weeks to return to full service after the cold snap. As a result, gasoline demand and prices may continue to rise into March and April.

The increase in gas prices comes at a time when COVID-19 travel restrictions are being lifted, leading to an increase in demand. DeHaan noted, "The lifting of travel restrictions has already caused an increase in gas prices due to rising demand."

In conclusion, the cold snap in Texas is expected to drive up gas prices in Rockford and nationwide. The decrease in oil production, combined with the annual switch to summer-blend gasoline and increased demand due to the lifting of COVID-19 travel restrictions, will likely lead to higher prices at the pump in the coming weeks.
