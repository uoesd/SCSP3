Brad Jones Named Interim President and CEO of ERCOT Amid Calls for Reform

AUSTIN, Texas – The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has named Brad Jones as its interim president and CEO, replacing Bill Magness who was fired following a deadly winter storm in February that resulted in widespread power outages. Jones previously worked in senior roles at ERCOT and was president of New York's power grid operator.

The move comes as ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) face criticism for their handling of the storm, which led to more than 100 deaths and left millions without power amid freezing temperatures. ERCOT's fall projections underestimated the maximum power demand and overestimated available power generation for severe winter conditions.

Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick called for the resignations of Magness and DeAnn Walker, head of the PUC, and Gov. Greg Abbott has called for reforms in ERCOT's governance. Lawmakers are facing pressure to pass legislation to prevent future power failures.

Jones' appointment is seen as a step towards addressing the issues that led to the power outages. He has experience in managing power grids in extreme weather conditions, having worked at ERCOT from 2003 to 2013, including serving as senior vice president of system operations. He also served as president and CEO of the New York Independent System Operator, which operates the state's power grid.

In a statement, ERCOT's board of directors said, "Brad's experience and expertise in managing power grids in extreme weather conditions make him the right choice to lead ERCOT during this critical time."

The appointment comes as Texas is likely to experience a hotter and drier summer than normal, increasing demands on the power grid. ERCOT has warned that the state's power reserves are expected to be lower than usual this summer, due to the shutdown of several coal-fired power plants and the continued growth in electricity demand.

In response to the crisis, lawmakers have proposed several reforms, including increasing the capacity of the state's power grid, improving communication between ERCOT and the PUC, and implementing measures to prevent power outages during extreme weather events.

The appointment of Jones as interim president and CEO of ERCOT is seen as a step towards addressing the issues that led to the power outages, but it remains to be seen how effective these measures will be in preventing future power failures. As Texas heads into a hot and dry summer, the pressure is on for ERCOT and lawmakers to ensure that the state's power grid can meet the demands of its residents.
