ONTARIO, Calif. (KABC) – Thousands of people came together in Norco, California, on Thursday to pay their respects to U.S. Marine Lance Cpl. Kareem Grant Nikoui, who was killed in the Kabul airport bombing on Aug. 26. Nikoui, 20, was among 13 U.S. service members who lost their lives in the attack, which also claimed the lives of over 100 Afghans.

A "Fallen Hero Procession" escorted Nikoui's remains from Ontario International Airport to Crestlawn Mortuary, where a funeral service is planned for Saturday. The procession drew people of all ages, including veterans who expressed outrage and sadness at the loss of life.

"We have to pay our respects to these young men and women who are sacrificing their lives for our freedom," said one veteran who attended the procession. "It's the least we can do."

The attack has also sparked discussions about the security and consequences of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Nikoui was providing security during the evacuation efforts when he was killed.

"It's heartbreaking to see these young people losing their lives in a war that's been going on for so long," said a local resident who came out to pay her respects. "We have to make sure their sacrifice is not in vain."

Remembrance ceremonies are also being held for another local Marine, Cpl. Hunter Lopez, who died in the same attack. Lopez, 22, was a rifleman with the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, based at Camp Pendleton.

The community's participation in the procession and funeral services reflected broad support and mourning for the fallen Marine.

"We're here to show our respect and gratitude for Kareem's service and sacrifice," said a local business owner who closed his shop to attend the procession. "We'll never forget what he and his fellow service members have done for us."

Nikoui's death has had a profound impact on the community, with many people expressing a sense of duty to pay their respects.

"We have to honor these young men and women who are putting their lives on the line for us," said a local teacher who brought her students to the procession. "It's the least we can do to show our appreciation for their sacrifice."

The funeral service for Nikoui is scheduled for Saturday at 11 a.m. at Crestlawn Mortuary. The service is open to the public, and the community is encouraged to attend and pay their respects.
