Comedian Blaire Erskine's Hilarious Take on the Facebook Outage

In the midst of the chaos caused by the Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp outage, comedian Blaire Erskine has brought some much-needed humor to the situation. Erskine, who has joined the writing team for Jimmy Kimmel Live!, has made a name for herself with her spot-on parody videos, and her latest offering is no exception.

In the video, Erskine poses as a Facebook spokesperson, addressing users' reactions to the outage with a healthy dose of sarcasm. She starts off by mocking the #DeleteFacebook movement, suggesting that users are overreacting to the sudden outage. "I mean, come on, guys, it's not like we're asking you to delete your Myspace page or anything," she jokes.

Erskine then goes on to lament the absence of Tom from MySpace, joking that users are missing his presence. "I know, I know, it's a tough time for everyone. But let's be real, we all know who the real MVP is here - Tom from MySpace. Where is he when you need him?" she says with a smirk.

But the real kicker comes when Erskine starts to speculate about the cause of the outage. "I mean, let's be real, guys, this is clearly a petty power move by Facebook," she says, deadpan. "They're like, 'Oh, you think you can just delete us? Well, we'll show you. We'll just shut down for a day and watch you all freak out.'"

Erskine's video has been met with laughs and applause from users who appreciate her unique take on the situation. And while she may be joking, her conspiracy theory has struck a chord with some viewers. "I'm not saying it's true, but it's definitely a possibility," she says with a wink.

Despite the widespread attention her video has received, Erskine was not aware that Facebook was back online when she posted it. "I swear, I had no idea," she says. "I was just trying to keep the joke going. But I guess that's just the power of Facebook - they can control everything, even my parody videos."

In the past, Erskine's parody videos have confused some high-profile figures, but she has yet to see any prominent people mistake her latest video for reality. "I'm still waiting for Tom from MySpace to give me a nod," she says, laughing. "That would be the ultimate seal of approval."

Overall, Blaire Erskine's parody video has been a much-needed breath of fresh air in the midst of the chaos caused by the Facebook outage. With her sharp wit and tongue-in-cheek humor, she has managed to make light of a situation that has left many users feeling frustrated and confused. And who knows - maybe Tom from MySpace will see her video and give her the recognition she's hoping for. Stranger things have happened, right?
