Tate Myre, Oxford High School Shooting Victim, Honored as Michigan State University Signee

In a heartwarming tribute, Michigan State University head football coach Mel Tucker announced Tate Myre, a victim of the Oxford High School shooting, as an honorary member of the Spartans' recruiting class. Myre, a talented tight end, linebacker, and running back for the Oxford Wildcats, had planned to visit Michigan State for a recruiting visit just days before the tragic attack that took his life.

"Tate was an exceptional young man with a bright future ahead of him," Tucker said in a tribute video. "He had a passion for football that was evident to everyone who knew him. His work ethic and athleticism were second to none, and he was a leader on and off the field."

Myre's coach in football and wrestling, Ross Wingert, remembered him as a hero. "Tate was the kind of kid who would run toward danger, not away from it," Wingert said. "He was a true hero, and his sacrifice will never be forgotten."

Witnesses said that Myre ran toward the shooter during the attack, putting himself in harm's way to protect his classmates. His bravery and selflessness have been widely praised, and he has been remembered in tributes from both college and professional football communities.

The shooting, which occurred on November 30, 2020, left three other students, Madisyn Baldwin, Hana St. Juliana, and Justin Shilling, dead and several others injured. The shooter, a 15-year-old student, and his parents face charges related to the shooting.

Myre's memory has been honored in various ways, including custom jerseys, gear, and patches worn by NFL players and the Michigan football team. The tributes are a testament to Myre's impact on his community and the lives he touched through his passion for football.

"Tate was a shining example of what it means to be a student-athlete," Tucker said. "He was a role model for his teammates, and his legacy will live on through the countless lives he touched."

Myre's family has set up a scholarship fund in his name to support student-athletes who embody his spirit and passion for football. The fund has received donations from across the country, a testament to the impact Myre had on those who knew him.

As the Oxford community continues to heal from the tragedy, Myre's memory will live on through the lives he touched and the lessons he taught about courage, sacrifice, and the power of sport to bring people together.

"Tate Myre will always be remembered as a Spartan," Tucker said. "His spirit, his passion, and his heroism will inspire us all for generations to come."
