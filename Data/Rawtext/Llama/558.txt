Taliban Negotiate with Qatar, Turkey over Kabul Airport Management

The Taliban are in talks with Qatar and Turkey regarding the management of Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport, a vital transportation hub that has been left without air traffic control services following the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan.

According to French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, securing safe access to the airport is a top priority. "The airport is a crucial asset for the future of Afghanistan, and we must ensure that it remains functional and secure," he said during a press conference in Paris.

The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has prohibited American civil aircraft from operating over Afghanistan without prior authorization, citing ongoing security concerns and the absence of a functional civil aviation authority in the country. However, a high-altitude jet route near Afghanistan's far eastern border remains open for US civil operators with FAA authorization.

Initially, the FAA allowed US air carriers and civilian pilots to fly into Kabul for evacuation or relief flights with US Defense Department approval. While US airlines have been participating in the evacuation effort, they have been operating from airports outside of Afghanistan.

The Taliban's negotiations with Qatar and Turkey aim to facilitate commercial flights for those wanting to leave Afghanistan, a country that has been plagued by conflict and political instability for decades.

The US military temporarily took over air traffic control in Kabul during the evacuation of tens of thousands of people, but the long-term management of the airport remains uncertain.

The lack of air traffic control services has raised concerns about the safety of flights in and out of Kabul, and the FAA has advised US civil operators to exercise caution when flying in the region.

Despite the challenges, the international community remains committed to supporting the people of Afghanistan. "We will continue to work with our partners to ensure that the airport remains a vital transportation hub, not just for Afghanistan but for the entire region," said Le Drian.

As the Taliban continue their negotiations with Qatar and Turkey, the fate of Kabul's airport remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: the international community will not abandon the people of Afghanistan in their time of need.
