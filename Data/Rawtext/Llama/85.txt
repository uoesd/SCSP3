Democrats Investigate Possible Collusion in Capitol Riot, Seek Answers on Pre-Riot Tours and Emergency Call Button Removal

Washington D.C. - Democratic members of Congress are intensifying their investigation into the January 6th riot at the Capitol, focusing on whether some lawmakers or their staff may have facilitated the breach by organizing pre-riot tours and removing emergency call buttons from offices.

Over 30 members of Congress have signed a letter demanding an investigation into the alleged pre-riot tours and possible collaboration. The letter, addressed to the House Sergeant at Arms, Senate Sergeant at Arms, and Capitol Police, seeks answers on how the rioters were able to gain access to the Capitol and target specific offices.

U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) stated, "Without proper credentials from Congress members, the rioters couldn't have entered the Capitol." She added, "We need to understand how this happened and who was involved."

U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) revealed that he has heard names of lawmakers who gave tours to rioters, but awaits verification before disclosing them. "We need to get to the bottom of this and make sure that those who are responsible are held accountable," he said.

U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-FL) and Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) have expressed skepticism and denials regarding the allegations. Buchanan stated, "There's no evidence to suggest that any member of Congress was involved in the riot." Emmer added, "These allegations are unfounded and harmful to the reputation of this institution."

Lawmakers and investigators have not disclosed specific evidence linking the tours to the riot or the targeting of specific offices. However, the rioters seemed to have specific knowledge of the Capitol's layout, targeting the offices of high-profile Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi.

Ali Alexander, the organizer of the 'Stop the Steal' rally, has claimed that Republican House members Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar, and Mo Brooks were involved in planning the event. However, the lawmakers have denied any involvement.

U.S. Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA) emphasized the need for a thorough investigation, stating, "We must ensure that the Capitol remains a safe and secure place for all members and staff. If there was any collusion or wrongdoing, we must hold those responsible accountable."

The investigation is ongoing, with unclear progress. The House Sergeant at Arms, Senate Sergeant at Arms, and Capitol Police have not commented on the allegations or the status of the investigation.

The January 6th riot was a violent and chaotic event that left several people injured and caused significant damage to the Capitol building. The incident has raised concerns about the safety and security of the Capitol and its occupants.

In conclusion, the investigation into the Capitol riot and possible collusion between lawmakers and rioters continues. While some lawmakers have expressed skepticism, others are calling for a thorough investigation to ensure that the Capitol remains a safe and secure place for all. The public awaits answers on how the rioters were able to breach the Capitol and target specific offices, and who, if anyone, was involved in facilitating the violence.
