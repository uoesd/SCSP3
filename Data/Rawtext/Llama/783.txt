Stimulus Checks of Up to $1,400 Per Person Expected in Covid Relief Package

Washington CNN – A third round of stimulus checks, with payments of up to $1,400 per person, is expected to be included in a $1.9 trillion Covid relief package that has been approved by the Senate and is awaiting President Joe Biden's signature after a final House vote.

According to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, efforts are underway to expedite the distribution of payments to eligible individuals. "We are working to get these payments out as quickly as possible, so that Americans can get the relief they need," Psaki said.

The relief package, which was passed by the Senate on Saturday, includes provisions for a third round of stimulus checks, with payments of up to $1,400 per person for individuals earning under $75,000, and couples earning under $150,000. The payments will gradually phase out for higher incomes, with those earning over $80,000 (individuals), $120,000 (heads of households), and $160,000 (couples) not receiving any payments.

Eligibility for the payments will be based on either 2019 or 2020 tax returns, depending on which is most recent. However, the payment distribution may be slightly delayed due to the ongoing tax filing season, but will start soon after the bill's enactment.

The eligibility criteria for the third round of stimulus checks are slightly stricter than previous rounds, potentially excluding higher income earners who previously qualified. However, taxpayers whose financial situation changed in 2020 may adjust their eligibility by filing their tax return promptly.

The relief package, which is part of President Biden's American Rescue Plan, aims to provide financial assistance to individuals and families affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to the stimulus checks, the package includes funding for vaccine distribution, testing, and contact tracing, as well as support for small businesses and communities hardest hit by the pandemic.

The stimulus checks are expected to provide a much-needed boost to the economy, which has been struggling to recover from the pandemic. According to a report by the Congressional Budget Office, the relief package is expected to create or save 1.5 million jobs and increase economic growth by 1.5% in 2022.

The passage of the relief package marks a significant victory for President Biden and his administration, which has made addressing the pandemic and its economic impact a top priority. "We are committed to doing everything we can to support the American people during this difficult time," Psaki said.

The relief package has received bipartisan support, with lawmakers from both parties recognizing the need for additional financial assistance for individuals and families affected by the pandemic. "We are proud to have worked with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this critical legislation," said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

The third round of stimulus checks is expected to benefit millions of Americans, including those who have been struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic. "This relief package will provide a lifeline for families who are struggling to pay their bills and put food on the table," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).

In conclusion, the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package, which includes a third round of stimulus checks of up to $1,400 per person, is expected to provide much-needed financial assistance to individuals and families affected by the pandemic. With efforts underway to expedite the distribution of payments, eligible individuals can expect to receive their stimulus checks soon after the bill's enactment.
