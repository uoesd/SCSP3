Stimulus Checks: Where Do We Stand on a Fourth Round?

As the country continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, discussions around a potential fourth stimulus check have been gaining traction. While the third round of checks from the American Rescue Plan has provided much-needed relief to millions of Americans, there is growing support for additional measures to support those who continue to struggle financially.

One proposal that has gained significant attention is the idea of $2,000 monthly checks until the pandemic is over. More than 75 members of Congress have expressed support for this measure, including Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who stated, "We need to make sure that people have the resources they need to get through this crisis." However, President Biden and Congress have yet to reach a consensus on this proposal.

Another option being considered is making the temporary $300 monthly child tax credit a permanent policy. President Biden has proposed this measure as a way to support families with children, stating, "We need to make sure that families have the support they need to raise their children." Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) has also introduced a bill for a Parent Tax Credit, which would provide up to $12,000 per year to support working parents.

In addition to these measures, there is also discussion around extending supplemental federal unemployment benefits beyond their scheduled expiration. With many Americans still struggling to find work, this extension could provide a vital safety net for those who need it most.

President Biden has also explored the possibility of student loan cancellation as a form of economic stimulus. While this measure is still under consideration, it is unclear whether it will be included in any future stimulus packages.

Despite these proposals, it is important to note that a fourth stimulus check or monthly payments are currently unlikely. President Biden has shifted his focus to other priorities, such as infrastructure, suggesting that additional stimulus measures may not be on the immediate horizon.

The existing measures aim to provide financial aid directly or through tax credits to specific groups such as children, parents, and the unemployed. While these measures have provided much-needed relief, the possibility and form of any future stimulus payments or financial support measures remain under discussion and subject to legislative approval.

In conclusion, while there is growing support for additional stimulus measures, it is unclear what form these measures will take or when they will be implemented. As the country continues to navigate the ongoing pandemic, it is important that policymakers continue to prioritize the needs of those who are struggling financially.
