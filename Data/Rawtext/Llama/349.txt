Suez Canal Crisis: 200,000 Live Animals Trapped, Facing Likely Death

The Suez Canal crisis has taken a devastating turn for the worse, with approximately 200,000 live animals trapped behind the stranded 'Ever Given' cargo vessel, facing likely death due to a lack of food and water. Gabrile Păun, the EU director for Animals International, has called this the worst maritime animal welfare tragedy in history.

The animals, mostly sheep and cattle, are running out of feed and water, with 130,000 of them originating from Romania. Despite EU law mandating ships carrying live animals to have 25% more food than planned, this rule is often not followed.

Romanian authority ANSVSA has claimed that there is enough food and water for a few days, but live animal exports have been suspended. However, Păun criticizes the lack of transparency and regulation in the industry, noting that mortality rates on these ships are not reported due to EU legislation.

Romania has been criticized by the European Commission for its poor practices in live animal exports. In the past, Romania has failed to meet transport conditions, leading to thousands of animal deaths. Păun suggests exporting meat rather than live animals as a more humane and profitable alternative.

"The lack of transparency and regulation in the live animal export industry is a ticking time bomb, and we're seeing the devastating consequences of this in the Suez Canal crisis," said Păun. "It's unacceptable that animals are being left to suffer and die in this way, especially when there are more humane and profitable alternatives available."

Despite the recognition of benefits in exporting processed meat, Romania continues to engage in live animal exports. Păun believes that this is due to a lack of political will and pressure from the livestock industry.

The Suez Canal crisis has highlighted the urgent need for stricter regulations and transparency in the live animal export industry. Animals International is calling on the EU to take immediate action to prevent such tragedies from happening again in the future.

In the meantime, the fate of the 200,000 animals trapped in the Suez Canal remains uncertain. As the days pass, their chances of survival diminish. It is a stark reminder of the need for more humane and sustainable practices in the animal agriculture industry.

The EU must take responsibility for the welfare of these animals and ensure that they are treated with the respect and care that they deserve. The Suez Canal crisis is a wake-up call for the industry, and it is time for change.

In conclusion, the Suez Canal crisis has exposed the dark underbelly of the live animal export industry. It is time for the EU to take action and ensure that animals are treated with the respect and care that they deserve. The export of processed meat is a more humane and profitable alternative, and it is time for Romania and other EU countries to adopt this practice. The lives of countless animals depend on it.
