The Princes and the Press: A Tale of Hostility and Jealousy

The BBC documentary, The Princes and the Press, has shed light on the reasons behind Harry and Meghan's departure from the UK, and it's clear that the British media played a significant role in their decision. The documentary portrays the media as hostile, particularly towards Meghan, a mixed-race American, with Dan Wootton, then of the Sun, admitting that he was "aggressively negative" towards her.

Internal royal jealousy, particularly from William and Kate's circle, also contributed to the tensions. The documentary suggests that Harry and Meghan's popularity led to negative media coverage, including personal allegations. Meghan's lawyer denied allegations of her being difficult and courtiers leaving, but the damage had already been done. A dispute over royal jewellery, known as "tiara-gate," highlighted the tensions between the palace and the Sussexes.

Initially, negative stories about Harry and Meghan were not reported, showing a reluctance to criticize them. However, over time, the narrative shifted to portray Harry and Meghan as demanding. The documentary suggests that Harry, more than Meghan, might be driving their recent decisions.

The public funding of the royals invites scrutiny and a demand for access to their lives. The documentary raises questions about the role of the media in the royal family's life and the impact it has on their mental health. It's clear that the constant scrutiny and negative coverage took a toll on Harry and Meghan, leading them to seek a more peaceful life outside of the UK.

In conclusion, The Princes and the Press highlights the hostility and jealousy that Harry and Meghan faced from the British media and the royal family. The documentary provides a deeper understanding of the reasons behind their departure and raises questions about the role of the media in their lives. It's time for the media and the public to reflect on their actions and treat the royal family with the respect and dignity they deserve.
