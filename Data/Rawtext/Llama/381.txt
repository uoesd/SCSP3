Outage Highlights Risks of Relying on Social Media for Business Communication

On October 4th, Facebook and its affiliated platforms, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Oculus, experienced a six-hour outage that left many businesses and organizations scrambling to communicate with their audiences. The incident highlighted the risks of relying solely on social media for communication and business operations, and served as a reminder of the importance of having backup systems and contingency plans in place.

According to John Guilfoil, Principal of John Guilfoil Public Relations LLC, "The recent Facebook outage is a prime example of why relying on a single platform for communication and business operations can be risky. Many brands and organizations use Facebook for advertising, retail outreach, virtual events, and customer service, but what happens when that platform goes down?"

Guilfoil advises against relying on a single platform and encourages diversifying communication methods. "It's important to have a backup plan, and that includes having a website and utilizing other communication channels like email, LinkedIn, and Twitter," he said.

The outage resulted in communication disruptions for those solely relying on Facebook, including the disappearance of news archives. Guilfoil noted that some entities, including town fire chiefs, prefer Facebook over creating and updating a website. "This is a problem because when Facebook goes down, they have no other way to communicate with the public," he said.

Guilfoil promotes the use of simple, free tools to create websites and advocates a 'web first' approach. "Having a website gives you control over your online presence and allows you to communicate with your audience even when social media platforms go down," he said.

During the outage, Guilfoil's clients were able to maintain communication through other platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and email. "It's important to have a diversified communication strategy that includes a website, social media, and email," he said. "This way, if one platform goes down, you can still reach your audience through other channels."

The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of having backup systems and contingency plans in place, especially for businesses and organizations that rely heavily on social media for communication and operations. "It's crucial to have a plan in place for when things go wrong, and to have alternative methods of communication that can be used in case of an outage," Guilfoil said.

The outage also emphasizes the importance of websites and diversified communication strategies, even in the era of dominant social media platforms. "Social media is a powerful tool, but it's not the only way to communicate with your audience," Guilfoil said. "Having a website and utilizing other communication channels can help you reach a wider audience and ensure that you can still communicate with them even when social media platforms go down."

In conclusion, the Facebook outage serves as a reminder of the risks of relying solely on social media for communication and business operations. Diversifying communication methods and having backup systems and contingency plans in place can help businesses and organizations avoid communication disruptions and maintain control over their online presence. By adopting a 'web first' approach and utilizing simple, free tools to create websites, businesses can ensure that they can still reach their audience even when social media platforms go down.
