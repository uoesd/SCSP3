In a moving tribute to President Joe Biden, 13-year-old Brayden Harrington delivered a rendition of John F. Kennedy's inaugural address during the "Celebrating America" event on Wednesday. The event, hosted by Tom Hanks, featured performances, poetry, and former presidents, but it was Harrington's speech that stole the show.

Harrington, who met Biden during a campaign stop in Concord, New Hampshire, in February, shares a bond with the president over their shared experience of stuttering. Biden has publicly spoken about his own struggles with stuttering and has been an advocate for those who stutter.

During their meeting, Biden encouraged Harrington not to let his stutter define him and assured him of his intelligence. The young boy was inspired by Biden's words and went on to speak at the Democratic National Convention in August, where he praised Biden for giving him the confidence to speak publicly.

Harrington's speech at the DNC has been viewed millions of times, and he has since become a role model for children who stutter. His book deal, announced in September, will see him release a children's book titled "Brayden Speaks Up" on August 10, with a middle-grade novel to follow in 2022.

"Brayden Speaks Up" aims to share Harrington's story and inspire others dealing with stuttering. The book will provide a platform for young people to speak up and embrace their unique voices.

The "Celebrating America" event was a 90-minute program that featured performances by celebrities such as Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, and Demi Lovato. But it was Harrington's speech that stood out, as he delivered JFK's iconic address with confidence and poise.

Harrington's message of perseverance and hope resonated with the audience, and his speech was met with a standing ovation. His participation in the event is a testament to the impact that Biden has had on the lives of young people who stutter.

In a country where millions of people stutter, Harrington's story serves as a reminder that stuttering does not define a person's intelligence or potential. It is a message that resonates with people of all ages and backgrounds.
