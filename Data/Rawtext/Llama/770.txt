AFI Establishes Scholarship Fund for Women Cinematographers in Memory of Halyna Hutchins

The American Film Institute (AFI) has established a scholarship fund for women cinematographers in memory of Halyna Hutchins, the cinematographer of "Rust" who tragically died after being shot by a prop gun containing a live round. The fund aims to support female cinematographers in building sustainable careers, continuing Hutchins' legacy of advocacy for women in cinematography and directing.

Olia Oparina, a close friend and collaborator of Hutchins, shared their journey and Hutchins' impact on the film industry. "Halyna and I were both immigrants who built our careers from scratch in Hollywood," Oparina said. "We formed a supportive 'tribe' along the way, and Halyna was a shining star among us. Her passion, craftsmanship, and advocacy for women in cinematography and directing inspired countless others to follow in her footsteps."

Hutchins' unexpected death at age 42 has deeply affected her family, friends, and the broader film industry. She was gaining recognition with offers for big-budget films like 'Archenemy' and 'Blindfire,' and her loss has left a void that the scholarship fund aims to fill. "We want to ensure that Halyna's legacy lives on through the next generation of female cinematographers," said an AFI spokesperson.

The scholarship fund is now accepting donations, and those interested in contributing can visit the AFI website for more information. Hutchins, born in Ukraine, graduated from UCLA's Professional Producing program and the AFI Conservatory. Her work on "Rust" was her breakout role, and her talent and dedication quickly made her a rising star in the industry.

Oparina emphasized the importance of supporting women in cinematography and directing, an area where women are still underrepresented. "Halyna was a trailblazer, and we need more women like her in the industry," Oparina said. "The AFI scholarship fund is a step in the right direction, and I hope it will inspire more women to pursue their dreams in filmmaking."

In conclusion, the AFI scholarship fund for women cinematographers in memory of Halyna Hutchins is a fitting tribute to a talented artist and advocate for women in film. It will support female cinematographers in building sustainable careers and continue Hutchins' legacy of passion, craftsmanship, and advocacy for women in cinematography and directing.
