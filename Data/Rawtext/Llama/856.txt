Tiger Woods' Crash Investigation Faces Criticism for Lack of Impairment Testing

The recent car crash involving golf legend Tiger Woods has sparked controversy over the LA County Sheriff's Department's handling of the investigation. Forensic experts and former law enforcement officials have criticized the department for quickly ruling the crash an "accident" without thoroughly investigating potential impairment.

Sheriff Alex Villanueva announced on the day of the crash that there was "no evidence of impairment" in Woods' SUV. However, experts point out that the lack of skid marks and Woods' inability to remember driving are signs of potential inattentiveness or impairment.

"It's surprising that they didn't call in a drug recognition expert (DRE) to evaluate Woods for signs of impairment," said Charles Schack, President of Crash Experts. "A DRE could have determined the need for a blood test by examining the driver's medications, eyes, and vital signs."

A blood test could have identified any medications or drugs in Woods' system, potentially leading to charges of misdemeanor driving under the influence. Former detective Jonathan Cherney indicated that the crash appeared to be a case of falling asleep at the wheel.

"The absence of attempts to brake or steer away from the crash site suggested a lack of attention or impairment," Cherney said.

However, it is now too late to access Woods' blood and medical reports without his cooperation or a search warrant. The sheriff's department obtained the SUV's 'black box' data but has not released its findings.

Chris Taylor, Managing Attorney at Taylor & Taylor, expressed concern over the lack of transparency in the investigation. "It's important for law enforcement to be thorough and transparent in their investigation, especially in high-profile cases like this," Taylor said. "The public deserves to know what happened and whether any potential impairment played a role in the crash."

The sheriff's department has faced criticism in the past for its handling of celebrity cases, including the investigation into the death of actress Natalie Wood in 1981.

Woods' crash occurred on the morning of February 23, when his SUV veered off the road and crashed into a tree in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The golfer sustained serious injuries, including a shattered ankle and two broken legs, and was transported to a nearby hospital for treatment.

The investigation into the crash is ongoing, but experts say that the sheriff's department's quick ruling of an "accident" without proper impairment testing may have compromised the case.

"It's crucial to investigate potential impairment in any crash, especially when there are signs of inattentiveness or erratic driving," Schack said. "The sheriff's department's handling of this case raises questions about their commitment to a thorough and impartial investigation."

As the investigation continues, the public remains eager for answers about Woods' crash and whether any potential impairment played a role. However, with the sheriff's department's reluctance to release information and Woods' refusal to cooperate, it may be some time before the truth is revealed.
