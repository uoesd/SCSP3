Prince Harry and Meghan to Lead Global Citizen's Vaccination Effort

In a bid to promote equitable vaccine distribution, Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will serve as campaign chairs for Global Citizen's vaccination effort. They will appear at 'Vax Live: The Concert to Reunite the World' on May 8, an event aimed at delivering COVID-19 vaccines to medical workers in poor countries.

The concert, part of the 'We Can Do This' initiative to increase vaccine confidence, will also feature appearances by President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and leaders from France, Canada, and Croatia. Global Citizen CEO Hugh Evans said that 60 nations had not received any COVID-19 vaccines as of April, highlighting the need for such an initiative.

Prince Harry and Meghan's effort includes raising money for COVAX to fund vaccines for medical workers. COVAX, a global alliance of countries, manufacturers, and non-governmental organizations, aims to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Global Citizen hopes to encourage business and G7 countries to donate and share vaccines.

"We are thrilled to have the Duke and Duchess of Sussex join us as campaign chairs for our vaccination effort," said Evans. "Their commitment to social justice and their ability to mobilize people to take action is inspiring. We are grateful for their support in our mission to ensure that everyone, everywhere has access to COVID-19 vaccines."

French President Emmanuel Macron also expressed his support for the initiative, saying, "The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that we are all interconnected and that we must work together to overcome global challenges. France is committed to supporting the COVAX facility and ensuring that vaccines are available to all, including the most vulnerable populations."

The concert will feature performances and appearances by global celebrities, with the aim of urging pharmaceutical companies to offer vaccines at not-for-profit prices. Celebrities will also encourage world leaders to prioritize vaccine distribution to those who need it most.

"Vax Live: The Concert to Reunite the World" will be held at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and will be broadcast live on various platforms. The event hopes to bring attention to the importance of vaccine equity and to encourage people to take action in support of Global Citizen's mission.

In a statement, Prince Harry and Meghan said, "We are proud to be a part of this effort to ensure that everyone, everywhere has access to COVID-19 vaccines. We must work together to ensure that no one is left behind in the fight against this pandemic."

With the support of prominent figures like Prince Harry and Meghan, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and President Macron, Global Citizen's vaccination effort is poised to make a significant impact in the fight against COVID-19. The concert on May 8 promises to be an exciting and meaningful event, bringing people together for a common cause.
