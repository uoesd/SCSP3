FBI Director Debunks Conspiracy Theories, Defends Intelligence Sharing

Washington CNN – FBI Director Chris Wray testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, refuting conspiracy theories surrounding the January 6 Capitol riot and defending the FBI's intelligence sharing practices.

In his testimony, Wray stated that the FBI has found no evidence to support the claim that the rioters were "fake Trump protesters" or that Antifa was involved in the violence. "We have investigated those claims, and we have found no evidence to support them," Wray said.

Wray also pushed back against claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, which have been promoted by President Trump and some of his allies. "We have not found any evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have changed the outcome of the election," Wray said.

Despite debunking these false claims, Wray did not denounce lawmakers who endorse QAnon conspiracy theories. "I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on elected officials or their views," Wray said.

Senator Richard Blumenthal expressed disappointment over Wray's reluctance to condemn elected officials amplifying QAnon theories. "I think it's important for the FBI director to speak out against dangerous and delusional conspiracy theories that can inspire violence and undermine our democracy," Blumenthal said.

Wray did, however, defend the FBI's sharing of the "Norfolk memo," an intelligence report about potential threats before the Capitol attack. "We shared that information widely with our law enforcement partners, including the Capitol Police," Wray said.

The Norfolk report was shared with law enforcement through email, a verbal briefing, and a law enforcement portal. Wray admitted that he did not see the Norfolk report until after January 6 and mentioned the challenge of sharing intelligence across departments.

When questioned by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, Wray explained that the FBI aims to develop better sources for gaining intelligence on domestic extremists. "We are working to improve our sources and methods to better identify and disrupt domestic extremist threats," Wray said.

Wray also mentioned that arrests have provided valuable information in gaining intelligence on domestic extremists. "We have made a number of arrests in connection with the January 6 attack, and those arrests have provided us with valuable information," Wray said.

In a heated exchange with Republican Senator Ron Johnson, Wray defended the FBI's handling of the Capitol siege. "I understand that there are a lot of questions about what happened on January 6, but I can assure you that the FBI did everything it could to prevent that attack," Wray said.

Over 260 defendants have been charged in federal court for their actions during the Capitol siege, most showing allegiance to Trump. Despite this, Wray emphasized that the FBI is committed to investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the violence.

In conclusion, FBI Director Chris Wray's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee served to debunk conspiracy theories surrounding the January 6 Capitol riot and defend the FBI's intelligence sharing practices. While Wray did not denounce lawmakers who endorse QAnon conspiracy theories, he emphasized the FBI's commitment to investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the violence.
