Judge Schroeder Defends Decision to Allow Rittenhouse to Pick Alternate Jurors

In a controversial move, Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder allowed Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old defendant accused of fatally shooting two men and injuring a third during civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, to pick six alternate jurors from a raffle tumbler. Schroeder has defended his decision, citing a past trial in Racine, Wisconsin, as the origin of the practice.

"I've been doing this for 20 years, and no one's ever complained," Schroeder said in court. "I think it's a good way to do it. It makes people feel better, and it maintains control."

Schroeder's decision to allow Rittenhouse to pick the alternate jurors is unusual, as typically, a courtroom clerk would draw jurors' numbers. However, Schroeder believes that letting the defendant make the draw helps to avoid bad optics.

Despite the unusual nature of the practice, prosecutors and defense attorneys did not oppose Schroeder's decision during the Rittenhouse trial. Schroeder has also criticized those questioning the practice, suggesting that they are attempting to undermine the trial's result.

Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to the charges, claiming self-defense in the shootings. Schroeder has also addressed his decision to bar the use of the word "victims" to describe the men Rittenhouse shot, noting that it's a standard courtroom rule.

Schroeder's decision to allow Rittenhouse to pick alternate jurors has sparked debate, with some arguing that it gives the defendant too much control over the jury selection process. However, Schroeder maintains that the practice is fair and impartial.

"I think it's a fair way to do it," Schroeder said. "I don't think there's anything unfair about it. I think it's a good way to pick jurors."

Schroeder's decision is not without precedent. In a 2018 trial in Racine, Wisconsin, a judge allowed the defendant to pick alternate jurors from a raffle tumbler. However, the practice is not common in most courtrooms.

Schroeder's decision has also raised questions about the role of judges in the criminal justice system. Some argue that judges should have more flexibility in their decision-making, while others believe that strict adherence to procedure is essential to ensuring a fair trial.

The Rittenhouse trial has attracted national attention, with many following the case closely. The trial is expected to continue for several weeks, with a verdict likely to be reached in the coming days.

Regardless of the outcome of the trial, Schroeder's decision to allow Rittenhouse to pick alternate jurors is likely to be remembered as a unique moment in the history of the American criminal justice system.

In conclusion, Judge Schroeder's decision to allow Kyle Rittenhouse to pick six alternate jurors from a raffle tumbler has sparked debate and raised questions about the role of judges in the criminal justice system. While the practice is unusual, Schroeder maintains that it is fair and impartial. The outcome of the trial will likely have significant implications for the future of criminal justice in America.
