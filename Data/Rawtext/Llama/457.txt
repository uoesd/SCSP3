Why Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Refused a Royal Title for Their Son, Archie

In a recent interview with royal biographer Andrew Morton, the reason behind Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision to refuse a royal title for their son, Archie, has come to light. According to Morton, the couple feared that the title "Earl of Dumbarton" might lead to bullying due to the word "dumb" in it. This concern was not about general bullying for being royal but specific mockery because of the title's name.

Morton suggests that the decision was motivated by Harry and Meghan's desire to protect their son from potential ridicule. "They were worried that Archie might be teased or bullied because of the name 'Dumbarton'," Morton said. "They wanted to avoid any possibility of their son being hurt because of his title."

However, there is contention around whether Harry and Meghan had a choice in Archie's titled status. During an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Meghan offered a different version of events, stating that the Royal Family was reluctant to make Archie a prince, which differed from the protocol. Meghan's revelations highlight concerns about Archie's safety and the importance of his royal status in that context.

Andrew Morton views the refusal of the title as indicative of the Sussexes' sensitivity to their public image. "Harry and Meghan are very aware of the media scrutiny that comes with being members of the Royal Family," Morton said. "They want to protect their son from any negative attention that might come his way."

The decision to refuse the title could also reflect a parental desire to shield Archie from potential bullying. Harry and Meghan have both spoken publicly about their own experiences with public scrutiny and bullying, and it's possible that they want to spare their son from similar treatment.

In conclusion, the issue of denying Archie the prince title and the decision against the 'Earl of Dumbarton' title may both be true, highlighting distinct concerns. While the Royal Family's reluctance to make Archie a prince may have been motivated by concerns about his safety, Harry and Meghan's refusal of the 'Earl of Dumbarton' title was likely driven by a desire to protect their son from potential bullying. Ultimately, the decision reflects the Sussexes' commitment to protecting their son and their sensitivity to their public image.
