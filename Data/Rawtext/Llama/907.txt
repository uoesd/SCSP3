Tom Brady Aims to Upgrade His Lombardi Trophy Toss in Future Parades

Tom Brady, the legendary quarterback of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, has set a new goal for himself: to toss the Lombardi Trophy overhand in a future championship boat parade. Brady shared his New Year's resolution on the Let's Go! podcast with host Jim Gray, revealing his desire to improve upon his previous underhand toss.

"I think I can do better than that," Brady said, referring to his viral underhand toss that successfully landed in the hands of teammate Cameron Brate. "I want to throw it overhand with a little more authority."

Brady's comments suggest a light-hearted approach to both his on-field frustrations and his championship celebrations. When asked about the feasibility of an overhand toss, he humorously noted that it depends on his consumption of avocado tequila.

"We'll see how much avocado tequila I have before the parade," Brady joked. "That's the real question."

Brady's previous underhand toss may have been successful, but it wasn't without controversy. A video of the toss went viral internationally, with some critics suggesting that it was disrespectful to the trophy. However, Brady's teammate, Cameron Brate, came to his defense, praising the quarterback's accuracy and skill.

"It was a great throw," Brate said. "I mean, it was a little unconventional, but that's just Tom being Tom."

Brady's comments on the Let's Go! podcast also touched on another recent controversy: his decision to smash a Microsoft Surface Pro tablet out of frustration during a game. The NFL warned Brady that another tablet-related incident would result in a fine, and the incident has since become a Twitter meme.

"I've got to be careful with those tablets," Brady said with a chuckle. "I don't want to get fined for smashing another one."

Despite the controversy, Brady's light-hearted approach to his on-field frustrations and championship celebrations has won over many fans. His dedication to improving his Lombardi Trophy toss is just another example of his commitment to excellence, both on and off the field.

"I'm always looking for ways to improve," Brady said. "Whether it's my passing game or my trophy toss, I want to be the best."

With his sights set on an overhand toss, Brady is already looking ahead to the next championship parade. And if his past success is any indication, fans can expect another unforgettable celebration from the legendary quarterback.

"I'm excited to see what the future holds," Brady said. "And I'm definitely going to practice my overhand toss."
