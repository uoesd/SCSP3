President Biden Unveils Comprehensive Strategy to Combat COVID-19

Washington, D.C. - Today, President Biden announced a comprehensive strategy to combat COVID-19, including increased vaccine supply and funding to support states, Tribes, and territories in their response efforts. The President's plan aims to administer 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days and maintain this increased supply for at least the next three weeks.

To achieve this goal, the Administration is increasing vaccine supply to states, Tribes, and territories by 5% this week, bringing the total weekly supply to 10.5 million doses, a 22% increase since January 20. This will enable more Americans to receive the vaccine and help slow the spread of the virus.

In addition, the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination will launch on February 11, offering vaccines through select pharmacies. Twenty-one national pharmacy partners and networks representing over 40,000 locations are involved in this program, which will prioritize vaccinations for priority groups at no cost in the initial phase, with limited supply.

President Biden has also directed FEMA to fully reimburse states for COVID-related National Guard Personnel and emergency costs retroactively from the beginning of the pandemic. The administration estimates retroactive FEMA reimbursements to total $3-5 billion and has requested $350 billion from Congress in the American Rescue Plan to support this effort.

"We are taking bold action to combat COVID-19 and protect the American people," said President Biden. "Our comprehensive strategy includes increasing vaccine supply, supporting states and Tribes, and ensuring that all Americans have access to the vaccine. We will do whatever it takes to keep our communities safe and get our country back on track."

The President's plan also includes increased funding for states, Tribes, and territories to support their response efforts. The Administration has requested $350 billion from Congress in the American Rescue Plan to support this effort, including funding for vaccine distribution, testing, contact tracing, and emergency relief.

"We are committed to working with states, Tribes, and territories to combat COVID-19 and support their response efforts," said Vice President Harris. "Our comprehensive strategy includes increased funding, vaccine supply, and support for our heroic frontline workers. We will do everything in our power to protect the American people and get our country back on track."

The Administration is committed to doing everything in its power to combat COVID-19 and protect the American people. With this comprehensive strategy, the President aims to administer 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days and help bring an end to the pandemic.
