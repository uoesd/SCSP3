Stimulus Payments: A Third Round of Relief for Eligible Americans

In a move aimed at providing further economic relief to Americans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, a third round of stimulus payments has been included in a $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. The package, which is expected to be signed into law by President Joe Biden, includes payments of up to $1,400 per person, including dependents. This means that a couple with two children could receive up to $5,600 in additional support.

Under the new package, families will now receive the additional money for adult dependents over the age of 17. This is a change from previous rounds of stimulus payments, which only included dependents under the age of 17. The expansion of eligibility for adult dependents is expected to benefit millions of Americans who have been struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic.

According to reports, about 90% of American households will be eligible for the third round of stimulus payments. Income limits for eligibility have been set at $80,000 for individuals, $120,000 for heads of households, and $160,000 for married couples. Eligibility will be based on the most recent tax return filed.

The payments are expected to start arriving shortly after President Biden signs the bill. However, it's important to note that the checks will phase out faster than previous rounds, cutting off people at a lower income level. This means that some individuals who received previous stimulus payments may not be eligible for the full amount this time around.

Unfortunately, undocumented immigrants without Social Security numbers remain ineligible for the stimulus payments. This is a disappointment for many who had hoped that the package would include provisions for these individuals, who have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

However, there is a silver lining for those who did not receive previous payments and believe they are eligible. They can claim the amount as a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 tax returns. This will ensure that those who have been struggling financially during the pandemic receive the support they need.

The third round of stimulus payments is a welcome relief for many Americans who have been struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic. With the expansion of eligibility for adult dependents and the increased payment amount, millions of families will receive much-needed support. While there are still some limitations to the package, it's a step in the right direction towards helping Americans recover from the economic impact of COVID-19.
