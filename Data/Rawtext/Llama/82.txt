Capitol Riot Arrests Spark Tension in Small Pennsylvania Town

KANE, Pa. (AP) – The small town of Kane, Pennsylvania, is facing a political divide after a local restaurant owner and her friend were arrested for participating in the Capitol riot on January 6. Pauline Bauer and William Blauser Jr. are among those charged for storming the Capitol, leading to partisan bickering in their hometown.

Bauer, who owns a restaurant in Kane, was recorded shouting at police during the riot to bring out Nancy Pelosi to be hanged. Despite the controversy, she claims her actions haven't harmed her friendships or business, with regular customers still supporting her.

"I don't think it's affected my business at all," Bauer said in an interview. "My customers are still coming in, and they're still supporting me."

However, not everyone in Kane is supportive of Bauer's actions. Joe Lanich, the owner of The Laughing Owl Press Co., expressed concern about the impact of the arrests on the town's reputation.

"It's not good for the town," Lanich said. "It's not good for businesses. It's not good for anyone."

The division over the Capitol riot reflects broader political splits, with significant differences in views across party lines. In Kane, a town that strongly supported Trump in the 2020 election, many still display pro-Trump signs.

Bauer, who became outspoken against COVID-19 lockdown measures, has embraced ideologies aligned with the sovereign citizens movement. Her friend, Blauser, continues to support her, highlighting their friendship.

"I've known Pauline for a long time, and I'm not going to turn my back on her now," Blauser said.

The cases of those charged in the Capitol riot are proceeding, with some already pleading guilty or being sentenced. Bauer and Blauser were arrested in May, and video evidence shows them entering the Capitol and participating in the riot.

Local resident Glenn Robinson expressed frustration with the situation.

"It's just a mess," Robinson said. "I don't know how this is going to get resolved."

Brandy Schimp, the mayor of Kane, declined to comment on the specifics of the case but emphasized the importance of respecting the legal process.

"We have to let the justice system run its course," Schimp said. "We have to let the legal process play out."

As the town navigates the aftermath of the arrests, residents are grappling with the implications of the Capitol riot and the political tensions that continue to simmer.

"It's a difficult time for everyone," Lanich said. "We just have to try to find a way to move forward."
