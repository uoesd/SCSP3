"Saddle River Range's 'Not Guilty' Sale Sparks Controversy"

CONROE, Texas (KPRC) – A gun store in Texas has sparked controversy with a promotion celebrating Kyle Rittenhouse's acquittal. Saddle River Range, located in Conroe, announced a "not guilty" sale via text message to customers, offering discounts on firearms, optics, bags, and gun parts.

The promotion has received mixed reactions from the public, with some expressing disappointment over the store capitalizing on a sensitive situation. Thomas Bolsch, the owner of Saddle River Range, stands by his message and refuses to change the promotion.

"We're not celebrating the loss of life, we're celebrating the Second Amendment and self-defense rights," Bolsch said. "We have the right to defend ourselves, and that's what this is all about."

Despite criticism, Bolsch claims most customer feedback has been supportive and positive. However, Dr. James Dixon, president of the NAACP Houston Branch, emphasizes the need for sensitivity in promotional messages, especially in light of recent protests against racial injustice following the shooting of Jacob Blake.

"In the broader context of what's happening in our society, it's important for businesses to be mindful of the messages they're sending," Dixon said. "It's not just about selling products, it's about being responsible members of the community."

The store's promotion has sparked a conversation about the intersection of business practices and societal issues. Some customers have expressed their support for the sale, while others have vowed to boycott the store.

"I understand why people might be upset, but I think it's important to remember that this is a business, and they're just trying to make a sale," said customer John Smith. "I don't see anything wrong with it."

On the other hand, customer Jane Doe disagrees. "I think it's tacky and insensitive. They're profiting off of a tragedy, and that's just not right."

The controversy surrounding Saddle River Range's promotion highlights the delicate balance businesses must maintain between profit and social responsibility. As the conversation continues, it's clear that the intersection of business practices and societal issues is a complex and ongoing challenge.

In conclusion, while the "not guilty" sale at Saddle River Range has sparked controversy, it's also served as a reminder of the importance of responsible business practices and sensitivity in messaging. As the community continues to grapple with these issues, it's clear that the conversation is far from over.
