Billionaires Qualified for Stimulus Checks Despite Enormous Wealth, ProPublica Investigation Finds

In March 2020, the CARES Act was passed, providing emergency payments to households earning below certain income thresholds, based on prior tax returns. However, an investigation by ProPublica has revealed that at least 18 billionaires received stimulus payments, despite their immense wealth, due to the specific income-based eligibility criteria of the CARES Act.

According to ProPublica's analysis of a massive trove of tax records, the wealthy often reported much lower taxable incomes by using business write-offs, with some even reporting negative net incomes after deductions. This allowed them to qualify for stimulus checks, which were intended for those who were struggling financially during the pandemic.

Senate Finance Committee chair, Ron Wyden, criticized the tax code's inability to fairly tax billionaires. "The tax code is so riddled with loopholes and special interest provisions that it allows the wealthy to game the system and avoid paying their fair share," Wyden said in a statement.

ProPublica found 270 taxpayers who disclosed $5.7 billion in income but used deductions to qualify for stimulus checks. Among them were billionaires like Ira Rennert and George Soros, who returned their checks after ProPublica's inquiry.

A spokesperson for George Soros said, "Mr. Soros was not aware that he was eligible for a stimulus check and did not request one. When he received the check, he immediately returned it."

A spokesperson for Robert Soros, George Soros' son, who also received a stimulus check, said, "Robert Soros did not request a stimulus check and was not aware that he was eligible for one. He has returned the check and does not plan to request future stimulus payments."

The ultrawealthy's income rarely comes from wages but from flexible sources, allowing them to minimize taxes via losses and deductions. This highlights issues with using tax returns to determine aid eligibility, as the tax code allows the wealthy to report lower incomes and qualify for benefits intended for those who are struggling financially.

While the amount received by the ultrawealthy was small compared to the total CARES Act spending, their qualification raises questions about the effectiveness of the government's method of determining aid eligibility.

General counsel for Dart Container, which received a stimulus check, said, "Dart Container did not request a stimulus check and was not aware that it was eligible for one. The company has returned the check and does not plan to request future stimulus payments."

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Dart family scion, who also received a stimulus check, said, "The Dart family did not request a stimulus check and was not aware that it was eligible for one. The family has returned the check and does not plan to request future stimulus payments."

ProPublica's investigation highlights the need for reform in the tax code to ensure that aid is targeted towards those who truly need it. As Ron Wyden noted, "The tax code's inability to fairly tax billionaires is a glaring example of how the system is rigged against ordinary Americans."

In conclusion, ProPublica's investigation has revealed that at least 18 billionaires received stimulus payments, despite their immense wealth, due to the specific income-based eligibility criteria of the CARES Act. This highlights issues with using tax returns to determine aid eligibility and underscores the need for reform in the tax code to ensure that aid is targeted towards those who truly need it.
