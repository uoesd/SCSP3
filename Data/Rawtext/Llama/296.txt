California Marks One-Year Anniversary of First COVID-19 Vaccine Administered, Governor Newsom Urges Continued Vigilance

SACRAMENTO – Today, California marked the one-year anniversary of the first COVID-19 vaccine administered in the state. To commemorate this milestone, Governor Gavin Newsom released an ethnic media column urging Californians to maintain strong immunity through vaccinations and boosters.

Governor Newsom stressed the importance of vaccination to slow the virus' spread and protect vulnerable communities. "Vaccines have been a game-changer in our fight against COVID-19, and we must continue to prioritize our health and safety," he said. "I urge all eligible Californians to get vaccinated and receive booster shots amidst rising case rates and hospitalizations."

California has made significant progress in vaccinating its residents, with over 62.7 million doses administered statewide. An impressive 86% of all eligible Californians have received at least one dose, and more than 6 million adults have received a COVID-19 booster shot.

To ensure equitable access to vaccines, California introduced first-in-the-nation measures such as mandatory vaccinations for healthcare workers and school attendance requirements. The state has also partnered with over 830 faith-based and community organizations to improve vaccination equity and outreach.

In light of rising case rates and hospitalizations, California has issued new guidance to protect its residents. This includes universal indoor mask mandates regardless of vaccination status and updated mega event and travel advisories.

Governor Newsom reiterated that COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are free for all Californians, regardless of insurance or immigration status. "We are committed to ensuring that every Californian has access to these lifesaving vaccines, regardless of their background or circumstances," he said.

In conclusion, California's efforts to combat COVID-19 through vaccination have been remarkable, but there is still work to be done. As the pandemic continues to evolve, it is crucial that Californians remain vigilant and continue to prioritize their health and safety. By working together, we can protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities from the virus.
