Stimulus Checks: Venmo Offers Fee-Free Cashing with 'Cash a Check' Feature

As the second round of stimulus payments is being delivered to eligible US adults, Venmo has introduced a new feature that allows select customers to cash their stimulus checks directly into their account. The 'Cash a Check' feature, which is linked to PayPal, Venmo's parent company, allows users to cash their checks without any fees.

To use the Venmo check-cashing feature, users need a verified email, a Venmo debit card or active direct deposit, and location services. Venmo has partnered with First Century Bank and Ingo Money to provide this service.

Venmo is waiving fees for cashing government stimulus checks, allowing users to access their stimulus money without a cut. The company has already waived $400,000 in fees and will resume normal operations with usual fees after the promotion ends.

To use the 'Cash a Check' feature, users need to download the Venmo app and verify their account information. They can then use the app to take photos of the stimulus check, and Venmo conducts a review process to ensure funds are available before depositing the check amount into the user's account.

The feature allows for instant access to funds or a standard waiting period, with fees waived for stimulus checks. Venmo also provides information for tracking and managing stimulus payments, including the potential of a third stimulus check.

The introduction of the 'Cash a Check' feature comes as millions of Americans are receiving their second round of stimulus payments. The payments are being delivered via direct deposit, paper checks, and EIP cards.

The second round of stimulus payments is part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed into law in March 2020. The act aimed to provide financial assistance to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 'Cash a Check' feature is part of Venmo's efforts to expand its services beyond person-to-person payments. The company has been exploring new ways to offer financial services to its users, including a debit card and a high-yield savings account.

Venmo's move into check cashing is also a response to the growing demand for digital financial services. With more people turning to mobile payments, Venmo is looking to capitalize on the trend by offering a convenient and fee-free way to cash checks.

The 'Cash a Check' feature is currently available to select Venmo users, and the company plans to roll it out to more users in the coming weeks.

In conclusion, Venmo's 'Cash a Check' feature offers a convenient and fee-free way for users to cash their stimulus checks. With its expansion into check cashing, Venmo is looking to provide a more comprehensive range of financial services to its users. As the demand for digital financial services continues to grow, Venmo is well-positioned to meet the needs of its users.
