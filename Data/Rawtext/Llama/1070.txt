Woman Claims to Have Given Brian Laundrie a Ride in Wyoming as Search for Missing YouTuber Continues

NEW YORK (WABC) – In a shocking new development in the case of missing YouTuber Gabby Petito, a woman has come forward claiming to have given Brian Laundrie, Petito's boyfriend and person of interest in her disappearance, a ride in Wyoming.

According to Miranda Baker, she picked Laundrie up on August 29, just four days after Petito's last known call to her family. Laundrie told Baker that he had been camping alone and that Petito was working on their social media.

Baker said that Laundrie exited her car after learning they were heading to Jackson Hole, and quickly disappeared. The FBI has since found a body in Grand Teton National Park matching Petito's description.

The Laundrie family attorney has released a statement offering prayers and condolences, but declining to comment further. Brian Laundrie remains missing, last seen by his family in Florida.

Police searches for Laundrie have focused on the Carlton Reserve in Sarasota County, Florida. Authorities have also released a body camera video of an interaction between Petito and Laundrie in Moab, Utah.

The interview with Miranda Baker can be viewed on 'Good Morning America'.
