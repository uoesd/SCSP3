FEMA Provides Over $1.7 Billion in Assistance for Hurricane Ida Recovery in Louisiana

BATON ROUGE, La. – The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved over $1.7 billion in assistance for the state of Louisiana to aid in the recovery from Hurricane Ida. The storm made landfall on August 26, 2020, causing widespread damage and destruction across the state.

"We are committed to helping the people of Louisiana recover from this devastating storm," said FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor. "We have been working closely with state and local officials to ensure that those affected by Hurricane Ida receive the assistance they need to rebuild their homes, businesses, and communities."

To date, FEMA has distributed over $889 million in federal grants and low-interest loans to support the state's recovery efforts. This includes $297 million paid in National Flood Insurance Program claims to survivors.

Assistance has been provided in various forms, including housing support, other needs assistance, and U.S. Small Business Administration loans for both individuals and businesses. Federal housing assistance has provided rental aid to over 179,000 homeowners and renters, helping them to find temporary housing while they work to repair or rebuild their homes.

Direct Temporary Housing assistance is also being offered in 10 of the most impacted parishes, providing eligible residents with temporary housing units. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has installed 33,200 "blue roofs" for temporary home roof repairs, helping to protect homes from further damage until permanent repairs can be made.

FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers have been set up across the state, providing a one-stop shop for survivors to access resources and assistance. Nearly 33,269 individuals have visited these centers seeking help. Disaster Survivor Assistance teams have also made over 143,544 home visits, helping to ensure that survivors have access to the resources they need.

The deadline for applying for FEMA assistance has been extended to November 29, 2021, to ensure that all survivors have enough time to apply for help. Applications can be submitted online or by phone, seven days a week.

"We urge anyone who has been affected by Hurricane Ida to apply for assistance," said Governor John Bel Edwards. "We are grateful for the support of our federal partners and will continue to work together to ensure that Louisiana recovers and rebuilds stronger than ever."

In addition to the federal assistance, the state of Louisiana has also committed over $1.3 billion in funding for recovery efforts.

"We are committed to supporting the people of Louisiana through this difficult time," said Governor Edwards. "We will continue to work with our federal partners to ensure that we are doing everything we can to help our communities recover and rebuild."
