GUILTY VERDICT IN GEORGE FLOYD'S DEATH BRINGS RELIEF, RENEWED CALLS FOR POLICE REFORM IN CHICAGO

CHICAGO (WLS) – Derek Chauvin's guilty verdict in the death of George Floyd sparked a mix of emotions in Chicago, with many expressing relief and a sense of justice while others called for continued action against police brutality and systemic racism.

"This verdict is a step towards justice, but it's not the end of the fight," said Chrishelle Green-Rogers, a local activist. "We need to keep pushing for change and hold our law enforcement accountable."

The city prepared for potential unrest by deploying 125 National Guard members to assist with street closures and ensure safety during protests. Businesses also took preventive measures by boarding up their windows, reflecting lingering apprehension from previous protests.

Despite the preparations, there was no actionable intelligence suggesting threats to public safety, according to Governor Pritzker. "We want to support peaceful protests while keeping our communities safe," he said.

The verdict sparked varied reactions from the public, with many seeing it as a hopeful sign of justice and accountability. "This is a good day for justice, but we have a long way to go," said Oscar Griffin, a community leader.

Jill Jin, a local resident, expressed a sense of relief. "I'm glad that justice was served, but I know that there's still a lot of work to be done."

Criticism remained over Mayor Lightfoot's decision to deploy National Guard troops, with Black and Latinx organizers condemning the move. "The deployment of the National Guard is not the solution to our problems," said Ti Chesley, a community activist. "We need to address the root causes of systemic racism and police brutality."

Andrew Weisberg, a criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor, believed the verdict was a step in the right direction. "This verdict shows that the justice system can work, but we need to continue to hold police officers accountable for their actions," he said.

Sharon Vuinovich, a local business owner, expressed gratitude for the peaceful protests. "I'm glad that the protests remained peaceful, and I hope that we can continue to work towards a better future," she said.

Humboldt Park resident Andre Williams saw the verdict as a sign of progress. "This is a step towards a better future for our community," he said. "We need to keep pushing for change, but this is a good start."

Tony Thedford, a community organizer, emphasized the need for continued action. "We can't stop now," he said. "We need to keep fighting for justice and against systemic racism."

Gil Soffer, a legal analyst, believed the verdict was a positive sign for police accountability. "This verdict shows that police officers are not above the law, and that's a good thing for our community," he said.

Governor Pritzker reiterated his commitment to supporting peaceful protests and ensuring public safety. "We will continue to work towards a better future for all Illinoisans," he said.

As the city moves forward, activists vowed to continue their fight against racism and police brutality. "We won't stop until we see real change," said Chrishelle Green-Rogers. "This verdict is just the beginning."
