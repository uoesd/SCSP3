Twitter Locks Chinese Embassy Account Over Uighur 'Baby Making Machines' Tweet

In a move that has sparked diplomatic tensions, Twitter has locked the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. Twitter account for violating its dehumanization policy. The account has been suspended after a tweet claimed that Uighur women were no longer "baby making machines," referring to a state-backed newspaper study.

According to a Twitter spokesperson, "We have taken action on the Chinese Embassy's Twitter account for violating our policy against dehumanization. We prohibit content that denies people their humanity, including by referring to them as 'machines' or 'animals.'"

The tweet in question was posted on January 7 and has since been removed. However, the Chinese Embassy has not posted any new content since January 9, suggesting that the account remains suspended.

The move by Twitter comes just days after Mike Pompeo, former Secretary of State, declared China's actions in Xinjiang as "genocide" in one of his final acts in office. President Joe Biden's Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has also expressed similar concerns about China's policies in Xinjiang.

In response to Pompeo's statement, China sanctioned him and 27 other Trump administration officials, barring them and their families from entering China.

The controversy surrounding the Chinese Embassy's Twitter account is just the latest in a series of escalating tensions between China and the international community over the treatment of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. At least one million Uighurs and other Muslims have been reportedly detained in camps in Xinjiang, according to a UN panel.

German researcher Adrian Zenz has accused China of using forced sterilization and abortion against Uighurs, which China denies. A Canadian House of Commons subcommittee has also concluded that the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang amounts to genocide, a claim that China has rejected.

The suspension of the Chinese Embassy's Twitter account follows the removal of Donald Trump's account due to the risk of violence. Twitter has faced criticism for its decision to suspend Trump's account, with some arguing that it was a violation of free speech.

In response to the controversy, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, stated, "We express our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to Twitter's move to suspend the Chinese Embassy's account. We urge Twitter to immediately restore the account and respect the rights of Chinese citizens to express their opinions freely."

However, Twitter has stood by its decision, reiterating that the account was suspended for violating its dehumanization policy.

The incident has sparked a heated debate on social media, with some users expressing support for Twitter's decision while others have criticized it as censorship.

In a statement, a Twitter spokesperson said, "We are committed to ensuring that our platform is a safe and respectful space for all users. We will continue to enforce our policies against dehumanization and hate speech, and we will not tolerate content that denies people their humanity."

The controversy surrounding the Chinese Embassy's Twitter account is unlikely to subside anytime soon, as tensions between China and the international community continue to escalate over the treatment of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.
