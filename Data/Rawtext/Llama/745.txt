Tragedy on the Set of 'Rust': Prop Firearm Discharges, Killing One and Injuring Another

A fatal accident occurred on the set of the Western movie 'Rust' outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, when a prop firearm discharged, killing a 42-year-old woman and injuring a 42-year-old man. The victims were identified as crew members.

According to Juan Rios, spokesman for the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office, "We received 911 calls about a person being shot on set." Deputies responded to the incident and found the woman deceased and the man injured.

Alec Baldwin, a producer and actor involved in the movie, was seen in tears outside the sheriff's office but did not comment on the incident. A spokesperson for Baldwin described the incident as an accident involving the misfire of a prop gun with blanks.

The movie 'Rust' was in the process of filming and was scheduled to continue production into early November. The plot centers around a 13-year-old boy who goes on the run with his grandfather (Baldwin) in 1880s Kansas.

This tragic incident recalls past fatal accidents involving prop guns on set, including the deaths of Brandon Lee in 1993 and Jon-Erik Hexum in 1984.

The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office is currently investigating the discharge of the prop firearm and the type of projectile involved. Production of the movie has been halted until further notice.

In a statement, the film's production company expressed their condolences to the families of the victims and confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in their investigation.

This incident serves as a reminder of the potential dangers involved in film production and the importance of safety protocols on set.

The investigation is ongoing, and Wink News will provide updates as more information becomes available.

In the meantime, the film industry has expressed shock and sadness over the incident, with many calling for increased safety measures to prevent such tragedies in the future.
