Fact Check: Kyle Rittenhouse's Mar-a-Lago Visit Was Not a Two-Week Vacation

Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager acquitted of charges related to the killing of two people and injuring another during a 2020 protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, recently visited Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach estate of former President Donald Trump. However, claims that Rittenhouse enjoyed a two-week, all-expenses-paid vacation at the luxurious resort are false, according to fact-checking by USA TODAY.

The misinformation spread rapidly on social media, accumulating thousands of shares. It is unclear who first made the claim, but it quickly gained traction on Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms.

Rittenhouse did visit Florida and Mar-a-Lago the weekend after his trial, but his stay was not a two-week vacation. Trump confirmed that Rittenhouse and his mother visited Mar-a-Lago, stating that Rittenhouse was a fan and wanted to say hello. Trump's spokesperson, Liz Harrington, tweeted a photo of Rittenhouse and Trump at Mar-a-Lago, further confirming the visit.

Mark Richards, Rittenhouse's lead defense attorney, stated that the claim of a two-week vacation is incorrect, but he did not specify the length of Rittenhouse's stay. Trump mentioned in an interview that Rittenhouse had left Mar-a-Lago a few days after the verdict.

Given the available information, it is clear that Rittenhouse's visit to Mar-a-Lago was not a two-week, all-expenses-paid vacation. The claim is rated as false. Kyle Rittenhouse was only at Mar-a-Lago for days at most, not for a two-week vacation.

It is important to note that the spread of misinformation is a common occurrence on social media, and it is essential to fact-check claims before sharing them. In this case, the claim of a two-week vacation for Rittenhouse at Mar-a-Lago was baseless and quickly debunked.

In conclusion, Kyle Rittenhouse did visit Mar-a-Lago after his acquittal, but his stay was not a two-week vacation. The claim is false, and it is important to be cautious when sharing information on social media to avoid perpetuating misinformation.
