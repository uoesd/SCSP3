FDA Expands Emergency Use Authorization for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 Vaccines to Include Additional Dose for Immunocompromised Individuals

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has amended the Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to include a third dose for certain immunocompromised individuals. This decision comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) prepares to discuss further recommendations for immunocompromised individuals.

Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D., emphasized the importance of this step for vulnerable populations amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. "Immunocompromised individuals, such as solid organ transplant recipients, are at a higher risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. The authorization of a third vaccine dose for these individuals is a critical step in protecting them from the virus," she said.

The additional vaccine dose is aimed specifically at solid organ transplant recipients or those with equivalent immunocompromise, and is not intended for the general population. Immunocompromised individuals have a reduced ability to fight infections, making them more susceptible to COVID-19. While a third vaccine dose may increase protection for these individuals, it is still important for them to take physical precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

The FDA advises immunocompromised individuals to discuss monoclonal antibody treatment options for COVID-19 with their healthcare providers. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced proteins that can help neutralize the virus and prevent severe illness.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for individuals aged 12 and older, while the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for individuals aged 18 and older. Both vaccines require two initial shots, and the third dose is approved to be given at least 28 days after the two-dose regimen to eligible individuals.

The EUA amendments were issued to Pfizer Inc. and ModernaTX Inc. following a thorough review of the available data and consultation with the CDC and the National Institutes of Health. The FDA will continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines and update the public as new information becomes available.

In conclusion, the FDA's expansion of the EUAs for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to include a third dose for immunocompromised individuals is a crucial step in protecting vulnerable populations from the COVID-19 pandemic. As the virus continues to spread, it is essential that individuals take all necessary precautions to prevent its spread, including getting vaccinated and following physical distancing measures.
