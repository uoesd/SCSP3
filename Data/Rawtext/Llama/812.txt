Expanded Child Tax Credit to Provide Relief to 61 Million Children in August

BALTIMORE (WBFF/WKRC) – In a move to provide financial relief to families across the country, the expanded federal Child Tax Credit is set to distribute approximately $15 billion in payments to families in August. This payment is part of the 'American Rescue Plan' initiated in March and will benefit roughly 61 million children.

The upcoming payment, scheduled for direct deposit on August 15, with mailed checks arriving a few days later, will be the third in a series of six monthly payments planned for this year. The first half of the credit is being distributed through monthly checks, with the remainder to be received during tax filing in 2022.

Eligible families must have at least one child under 18, and the payment amounts are $300 per child under 6 and $250 per child between 6 and 17. However, eligibility for the full Child Tax Credit begins to phase out for incomes exceeding $150,000 for joint filers, $112,500 for heads of households, and $75,000 for single filers. A phaseout reduces the Child Tax Credit by $50 for each $1,000 above the income threshold.

Unfortunately, an error in July's direct deposit affected 15% of recipients, which is expected to be resolved for this month's payment. The IRS will also send a letter at the year's end to families who received checks, which is necessary for tax filing in 2022.

The expanded Child Tax Credit aims to provide much-needed relief to families who have been struggling financially due to the pandemic. According to the IRS, the credit is designed to help families cover the costs of raising their children, including expenses such as food, clothing, and education.

The payment schedule for the remainder of the year is as follows: September 15, October 15, November 15, and December 15. Families who are eligible for the credit will receive a letter from the IRS with more information about the payment schedule and how to receive the credit.

In addition to the Child Tax Credit, the 'American Rescue Plan' also includes other provisions aimed at supporting families, such as an increased Earned Income Tax Credit and a temporary expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit.

The expanded Child Tax Credit is a welcome relief for many families who have been struggling to make ends meet. With the continued support of programs like this, families can focus on providing their children with the best possible start in life, without worrying about the financial burden.

In conclusion, the expanded Child Tax Credit is a vital lifeline for families across the country, providing them with the financial support they need to raise their children. With the next payment scheduled for August 15, families can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that help is on the way.
