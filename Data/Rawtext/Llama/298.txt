WHO Grants Emergency Use Listing for COVAXIN®, Eighth COVID-19 Vaccine to Receive Approval

Geneva, Switzerland - The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued an emergency use listing (EUL) for COVAXIN®, a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech. This marks the eighth vaccine to receive WHO's EUL for COVID-19, and it is a significant step forward in the global effort to combat the pandemic.

Dr. Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products, emphasized the importance of vaccines in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting public health. "Vaccines are a game-changer in our fight against COVID-19, and we must prioritize the most at-risk groups," she said.

The WHO's EUL is a crucial step in expediting the regulatory approval process for COVID-19 vaccines. It allows countries to quickly approve vaccines for emergency use, ensuring that they can be distributed and administered to those who need them most.

COVAXIN® is formulated from an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 antigen and is suitable for low- and middle-income countries due to its easy storage requirements. The vaccine's efficacy, safety, and quality were thoroughly reviewed by the WHO Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE).

SAGE recommended a two-dose regimen of COVAXIN®, with a dose interval of four weeks, for individuals aged 18 and above. The vaccine has a 78% efficacy against COVID-19 of any severity, 14 days after the second dose.

Over 120,000 pregnant women in India have been vaccinated with COVAXIN®, with no short-term adverse effects reported. This is a significant development, as it demonstrates the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in a vulnerable population.

The EUL process requires the producing company to continue generating data for full licensure and WHO prequalification. This ensures that the vaccine meets the highest standards of safety and efficacy, and that it can be widely distributed and administered to protect public health.

In conclusion, the WHO's issuance of an emergency use listing for COVAXIN® is a significant milestone in the fight against COVID-19. It demonstrates the organization's commitment to ensuring that safe and effective vaccines are available to all, regardless of their income or geographical location. With this approval, we are one step closer to achieving our goal of ending the pandemic and protecting the health and well-being of people around the world.
