Democrats Push for Recurring $2,000 Stimulus Checks as Covid-19 Pandemic Continues

As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the US economy, some Democrats in Congress are advocating for recurring $2,000 stimulus checks to help Americans weather the financial storm.

In a letter sent to President Joe Biden, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and other lawmakers urged the administration to consider direct payments and automatic unemployment insurance extensions tied to economic conditions. "We believe that recurring payments would provide a critical lifeline to families and individuals who are struggling to make ends meet during this pandemic," Omar said in a statement.

Senate Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), are also planning to send a similar letter to Biden, though they have not specified a dollar amount or frequency for the stimulus checks. Sanders has previously called for $2,000 monthly payments until the end of the pandemic.

The proposal has gained traction among some Democrats, who argue that it would provide much-needed relief to Americans who are struggling financially. According to the Urban Institute, a one-time $1,200 stimulus check and enhanced unemployment insurance could prevent 12 million people from falling into poverty.

However, the proposal is unlikely to gain support from Senate Republicans and some moderate Democrats, such as Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV). Manchin has expressed concerns about the cost of recurring payments, and has suggested that a one-time payment would be more appropriate.

President Biden, a moderate Democrat, is also seen as unlikely to support the proposal for recurring checks. Biden's stimulus package, which includes a one-time, $1,400 stimulus check, is currently being considered by the Senate.

Despite the opposition, supporters of the recurring payments argue that 65% of Americans, including majorities of Republicans and independents, favor them. "The American people are hurting, and they need our help," Sanders said in a recent statement. "We must do everything we can to support them during this difficult time."

Warren has also emphasized the need for recurring payments, citing the ongoing nature of the pandemic. "The pandemic isn't going away anytime soon, and neither should our support for the American people," she said.

Omar has similarly stressed the importance of providing ongoing relief. "We can't just provide a one-time payment and expect people to be okay," she said. "We need to make sure that people have the resources they need to get through this pandemic."

While the proposal for recurring $2,000 stimulus checks faces an uphill battle, it highlights the ongoing debate over how best to support Americans during the pandemic. As the crisis continues, it remains to be seen what measures will be taken to provide relief to those who need it most.
