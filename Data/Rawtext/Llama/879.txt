Tiger Woods Involved in Serious Car Accident, Sheriff's Department Seeks Black Box Data

Golf legend Tiger Woods was involved in a serious car accident on Tuesday, with a local resident finding him unconscious in his SUV. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is now seeking to review the vehicle's black box data to understand the pre-collision speed and brake usage.

According to Sheriff Alex Villanueva, "We are trying to determine if there was any distracted driving, or if he had fallen asleep at the wheel." Villanueva added that there were no signs of impairment by substances, and hence no tests were administered nor charges filed against Woods.

The first responder, a mystery man living near the crash site, attempted to communicate with Woods but received no response. Woods was described as 'calm and lucid' when fire officials extricated him from the wreckage.

Woods suffered a shattered ankle, two leg fractures, and has had multiple surgeries. He testified to deputies that he had no recollection of driving or how the accident happened.

The golfing community has rallied around Woods, with Rory McIlroy and other golfers wearing red and black in solidarity, expressing their well-wishes for Woods' recovery. Woods himself thanked fellow golfers and fans for their support in his first public comment since the accident.

The accident occurred on Tuesday morning, when Woods' SUV crashed into a tree in the Rolling Hills Estates area of Los Angeles. The Sheriff's Department received a call at 7:12 AM, and deputies arrived to find Woods trapped in the vehicle.

The investigation into the accident is ongoing, with the Sheriff's Department seeking to retrieve data from the vehicle's black box. The black box, also known as an Event Data Recorder, captures information about the vehicle's speed, braking, and other relevant data in the moments leading up to a crash.

Sheriff Villanueva stated that the black box data would be crucial in determining the cause of the accident. "We want to know what was happening in the moments leading up to the crash," he said. "The black box will give us a better understanding of what occurred."

Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, released a statement expressing gratitude for the support Woods has received. "Tiger and his family are grateful for the outpouring of support and encouragement they have received from the golf community and fans around the world."

Steinberg also provided an update on Woods' condition, stating that he was "resting comfortably" and "receiving excellent care" at the hospital.

The accident has sparked a renewed debate about the dangers of distracted driving. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was responsible for 3,166 deaths in the United States in 2017.

The Sheriff's Department has urged drivers to remain vigilant and avoid distractions while behind the wheel. "Distracted driving is a serious issue that can have devastating consequences," said Villanueva. "We urge all drivers to stay focused on the road and avoid distractions."

As the investigation into the accident continues, the golfing world remains optimistic about Woods' recovery. McIlroy, who wore red and black in solidarity with Woods, expressed his support for the golfing legend. "We're all thinking of Tiger and wishing him a speedy recovery," he said.

Woods' accident serves as a reminder of the dangers of distracted driving and the importance of staying focused on the road. As the Sheriff's Department continues its investigation, the golfing community remains united in their support for Woods' recovery.
