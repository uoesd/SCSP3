Stimulus Checks and Debt: What You Need to Know

Last week, the government sent out 90 million stimulus checks as part of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. However, for those who didn't receive their 2020 stimulus checks, there's still hope. Americans can get the money through Recovery Rebate Credits by filing their 2020 federal taxes.

It's important to note that certain debts, such as child support, back taxes, and other outstanding debts, may reduce your tax return if you receive your stimulus as a Recovery Rebate Credit. However, the December $900 billion Covid relief bill protected the second round of stimulus checks from all creditor garnishment, including private creditors.

Tax refunds, including stimulus received as a tax rebate, may be reduced to pay back various debts through the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). However, the IRS will not use stimulus rebates to pay for federal tax debts, but cannot prevent offsets for state and other federal agency debts.

The $1,400 stimulus check under the American Rescue Plan is not subject to garnishment for unpaid federal or state debts, but can be for private debts under a court order. Consumer advocacy and banking groups are urging Congress to pass legislation to exempt the latest stimulus payments from garnishment.

The American Bankers Association and Americans for Financial Reform are among the groups advocating for this legislation. They argue that the stimulus payments are intended to help individuals and families who are struggling financially due to the pandemic and should not be used to pay off debts.

In the meantime, individuals can track the status of their third stimulus payment using the IRS's Get My Payment site. The site allows users to check the status of their payment, confirm their payment method, and enter their bank account information to receive their payment more quickly.

It's important to note that the IRS will not use stimulus rebates to pay for federal tax debts, but cannot prevent offsets for state and other federal agency debts. Therefore, individuals who have outstanding debts should be aware that their stimulus payment may be reduced or offset to pay off these debts.

Overall, the stimulus checks and Recovery Rebate Credits are designed to provide financial relief to individuals and families who are struggling due to the pandemic. However, it's important to be aware of the potential impact of debts on these payments and to take steps to protect your stimulus payment from garnishment.

In conclusion, the American Rescue Plan's stimulus checks and Recovery Rebate Credits are providing much-needed financial relief to millions of Americans. However, it's important to be aware of the potential impact of debts on these payments and to take steps to protect your stimulus payment from garnishment. Consumer advocacy and banking groups are urging Congress to pass legislation to exempt the latest stimulus payments from garnishment, and individuals can track the status of their third stimulus payment using the IRS's Get My Payment site.
