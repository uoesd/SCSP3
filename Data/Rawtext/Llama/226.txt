FUEL CHAOS IN THE SOUTHEAST: DRIVERS IGNORE PLEAS NOT TO HOARD GASOLINE

ATLANTA, May 12 (Reuters) – A major pipeline shutdown caused by a ransomware hack has led to a fuel crisis in the Southeast United States, with drivers ignoring government pleas not to hoard gasoline and causing chaos at gas stations.

Lines formed at gas stations across the region, with many running out of fuel due to increased demand. Fistfights and altercations over gasoline were reported in several locations, highlighting the desperation and frustration of drivers.

According to industry representatives, nearly 60% of gas stations in metro Atlanta and over 70% in Charlotte, Raleigh, and Pensacola were without gas. The average national gasoline price rose to above $3.00 a gallon, the highest since October 2014.

The Colonial Pipeline shutdown has heavily affected the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, prompting the Biden administration to warn against hoarding and filling plastic bags with fuel. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp temporarily suspended gas taxes to ease price hikes, but some individuals are going to great lengths to stockpile fuel, disregarding official advice.

Ronald Ross, a DoorDash driver, said he had been waiting in line for over an hour to get gas. "I've never seen anything like this before. People are getting aggressive and cutting in line. It's crazy," he said.

James Jones, a contractor in Atlanta, expressed frustration at the lack of fuel. "I need gas to get to work, but every station I've been to is out. It's ridiculous," he said.

Cherie Thomas, manager of an Exxon Mobil station in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, described the situation as "chaotic." "We've had people fighting and yelling at each other. It's not safe for our employees or customers," she said.

Rob Underwood, president of Energy Marketers of America, urged drivers to stay calm and not exacerbate the situation by hoarding. "We understand that people are concerned, but panic buying only makes things worse. We need to work together to get through this," he said.

Despite the pleas for calm, many drivers continue to stockpile fuel, with some even resorting to filling plastic bags with gasoline. Industry representatives warn that this behavior is not only illegal but also dangerous, as gasoline is highly flammable and can pose serious health risks.

The Colonial Pipeline hack has highlighted the vulnerability of the nation's energy infrastructure and the need for greater security measures to prevent such incidents in the future. In the meantime, drivers in the Southeast are left to navigate the fuel crisis and hope for a swift resolution.

As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the fuel chaos in the Southeast is a stark reminder of the importance of a reliable energy supply and the need for responsible behavior in times of crisis.
