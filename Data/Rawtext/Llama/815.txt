Stimulus Checks Reach Thousands of Americans Abroad During Pandemic

As the Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the global economy, the U.S. government authorized three rounds of stimulus payments to support households across the country. But did you know that some of those payments also made their way to Americans living abroad?

According to a recent report by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), over 3.7 million payments worth $5.5 billion were sent outside the 50 states and Washington, D.C. during the pandemic. Eligible recipients included U.S. citizens living abroad, military members stationed overseas, and residents of U.S. territories.

"The location of U.S. citizens doesn't matter in a global pandemic," said Kyle Pomerleau, Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. "These payments were intended to support household finances, regardless of where they were located."

The overseas payments accounted for less than 1% of the total stimulus funds, but they were still a significant source of support for those who received them. Janet Holtzblatt, Senior Fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, noted that the payments were technically advance payments of the recovery rebate tax credit. "The primary intent of the checks was to support household finances amid the pandemic," she said.

Garrett Watson, Senior Policy Analyst at the Tax Foundation, pointed out that while the payments were well-intentioned, there were some errors in their distribution. "Mistaken payments were made, including to non-citizens and in the form of duplicate payments," he said.

Despite these errors, the IRS reportedly correctly paid at least 98% of first-round funds. "The IRS did a good job of getting the payments out quickly and accurately, despite the challenges of a global pandemic," said Pomerleau.

The stimulus payments were authorized by Congress as part of the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, and the American Rescue Plan Act. They were designed to provide financial support to households during a time of unprecedented economic uncertainty.

In conclusion, while the majority of stimulus payments went to households within the 50 states and Washington, D.C., a significant number of Americans living abroad also received support during the pandemic. As the world continues to grapple with the economic fallout of Covid-19, it's clear that the U.S. government is committed to supporting its citizens, no matter where they are in the world.
