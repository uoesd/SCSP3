Winter Storm Lana Brings Heavy Snow and Power Outages to the South

A powerful winter storm, named Lana, swept through the southern United States, bringing heavy snowfall, power outages, and dangerous road conditions to several states. The storm made its presence known in parts of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.

In Texas, Winter Storm Lana caused extensive snowfall, with some areas receiving more than a half foot of snow. The heavy snowfall resulted in over 150,000 homes and businesses losing power, with over 100,000 of these outages in Texas alone. The storm's impact was particularly felt in Tyler, Texas, where a tree fell, damaging a home and two cars, although no injuries were reported.

Schools in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama either canceled classes or delayed openings due to the storm. The decision to close schools was made to ensure the safety of students and staff, as the storm made travel conditions hazardous.

In Louisiana, the storm's impact was significant, with numerous crashes and disabled vehicles reported by the Louisiana State Police. The slick road conditions made it difficult for motorists to navigate, and as a result, Interstates 49 and 220 near Shreveport, Louisiana, were closed, along with several state highways.

In response to the storm, Louisiana closed state government offices in 29 parishes, while Hinds County, Mississippi, delayed opening government offices. The closure of government offices was a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of employees and the public.

In Jackson, Mississippi, road crews worked tirelessly to treat icy bridges, and warnings of icy conditions extended to the Tennessee and Alabama state lines. The storm's impact on roads was significant, with continued snowfall reported in several counties.

In Alabama, the storm's impact was felt in the northern and north-central parts of the state, with heavy snowfall reported in several counties. The Alabama Department of Transportation worked to clear roads, but the snowfall made it a challenging task.

The Weather Company's mission is to report on breaking weather news and the importance of science. This report serves as part of that mission, highlighting the impact of Winter Storm Lana and the importance of staying informed during severe weather events.

In conclusion, Winter Storm Lana brought significant snowfall, power outages, and dangerous road conditions to the southern United States. The storm's impact was felt in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, with schools, government offices, and roads affected.
