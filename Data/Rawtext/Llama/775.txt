Tragedy on the Set: Lessons from the 'Rust' Shooting

CNN – As a union prop master with over 20 years of experience, I've had the privilege of working on various film and television productions, including Saturday Night Live. Recently, the tragic incident on the set of the movie Rust has left the industry reeling. The death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injury of director Joel Souza serve as a stark reminder of the importance of safety protocols and team cohesion.

The Rust shooting is a harsh reminder of the potential dangers that exist on film sets. Media reports and inside accounts suggest that the production suffered from long days, insufficient accommodations, and low morale. Assistant Director David Halls, who handed Alec Baldwin the fatal gun, admitted to not checking all the rounds, according to a search warrant affidavit. Halls had a history of disregarding safety protocols, and there were two previous accidental discharges on the Rust set.

Hannah Gutierrez, the armorer on Rust, was relatively inexperienced, having only one other stint as head armorer. While it's essential to give newcomers a chance to learn and grow, it's equally important to acknowledge when help is needed. The prop master's profession requires admitting ignorance and seeking help, especially concerning firearm safety.

In contrast, my experience on Saturday Night Live taught me the importance of patience, fairness, and adherence to safety protocols. Our team was like a well-oiled machine, with everyone knowing their role and working together seamlessly. Safety was always our top priority, and we never compromised on that.

The Rust tragedy serves as an ironic and cautionary tale. It's a reminder that even the most seasoned professionals can make mistakes, and that it's crucial to respect worker safety to prevent fatal accidents. The film industry must learn from this incident and prioritize safety protocols to avoid another tragedy like this.

As a prop master, I understand the pressure to meet deadlines and deliver high-quality work. However, safety must always come first. It's our responsibility to ensure that everyone on set returns home safely at the end of the day.

The Rust incident should be a wake-up call for the industry. It's time to take a hard look at our practices and make changes to prevent such tragedies from happening again. It's crucial to invest in proper training, provide adequate resources, and foster a culture of safety on set.

In conclusion, the Rust shooting is a sobering reminder of the importance of safety protocols and team cohesion. As a union prop master, I urge the film industry to learn from this tragedy and prioritize worker safety to prevent fatal accidents. By working together and putting safety first, we can create a safer and more successful film industry for all.
