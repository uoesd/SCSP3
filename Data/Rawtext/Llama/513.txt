Hurricane Ida's Devastating Impact on Gulf of Mexico Oil Production

HOUSTON, Sept 20 – Royal Dutch Shell, the largest U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil producer, is facing significant damage from Hurricane Ida, which made landfall on August 26. The storm has impacted the company's production into early next year, with around 40% of its production from the offshore region remaining offline three weeks after the storm.

According to sources, Hurricane Ida removed 28 million barrels from the market, raising crude prices as buyers looked for alternatives to the Gulf Mars grade. The damaged Shell transfer facility, West Delta-143, impacts the supply of Mars sour crude, a grade highly sought by refiners in the U.S. and Asia.

Rystad Energy analyst estimated the lost production would reduce the Gulf of Mexico oil supply by 200,000 to 250,000 bpd for several months. Mars crude prices reached a one-year high this month but then dropped to a $2 per barrel discount to the U.S. benchmark.

Shell's Mars and Ursa oilfields, contributing about 200,000 bpd combined, are expected to be affected into the first quarter of next year. The prolonged shut-in of the WD-143 platform is also affecting smaller operators, such as LLOG Exploration Co LLC.

The storm's impact on oil production is significant, with 18% of U.S. Gulf's oil and 27% of its natural gas production remaining offline more than three weeks after Hurricane Ida. Mars crude exports accounted for about 5.5% of total U.S. crude exports in the first eight months of 2021.

The damage to Shell's facilities is extensive, with the company stating that the West Delta-143 platform, which processes and exports oil and gas from several fields, suffered significant damage. The platform is expected to be out of commission for several months, impacting the supply of Mars crude.

The impact of Hurricane Ida on Gulf of Mexico oil production is not limited to Shell's operations. Other producers, such as BP and Chevron, have also reported damage to their facilities. However, Shell's Mars and Ursa oilfields are the largest producers in the region, and their shutdown is expected to have a significant impact on the global oil market.

The U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) has been working closely with operators to assess the damage and ensure the safe restart of production. However, the process is expected to take several months, and the full impact of the storm on Gulf of Mexico oil production is still being assessed.

In the meantime, oil refiners are looking for alternative sources of crude to replace the lost production from the Gulf of Mexico. This has led to an increase in crude prices, as refiners compete for a limited supply of oil.

The impact of Hurricane Ida on Gulf of Mexico oil production is a reminder of the vulnerability of the region's energy infrastructure to natural disasters. The region is prone to hurricanes, and the oil and gas industry has experienced significant disruptions in the past due to storms.

Despite the challenges, the oil and gas industry is committed to restoring production and ensuring the safe operation of its facilities. The recovery efforts are expected to take several months, and the full impact of Hurricane Ida on Gulf of Mexico oil production will be felt for some time to come.

In conclusion, Hurricane Ida has had a devastating impact on Gulf of Mexico oil production, with Shell's operations being significantly affected. The damage to the West Delta-143 platform and the shutdown of the Mars and Ursa oilfields are expected to have a lasting impact on the global oil market. The industry is working hard to restore production, but the recovery efforts are expected to take several months.
