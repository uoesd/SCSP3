Defendants Take the Stand in High-Profile Trials, Defying Tradition

CHICAGO (AP) – In a shift from traditional legal strategy, an increasing number of defendants in high-profile trials are choosing to take the stand and testify in their own defense. This trend has been observed in several recent trials, including those of Kim Potter, Kyle Rittenhouse, Jussie Smollett, Travis McMichael, Elizabeth Holmes, and Potter herself.

According to Alan Tuerkheimer, a Chicago-based jury consultant, social media may be influencing defendants' decisions to speak out. "In today's world, people are more comfortable with the idea of sharing their story and defending themselves publicly," Tuerkheimer said. "Social media has created a culture where people feel like they have a platform to tell their side of the story."

Former federal prosecutor Phil Turner, however, remains skeptical about a significant shift in lawyers' attitudes towards defendants testifying. "While we may see more defendants taking the stand, it's still a risky strategy," Turner said. "Defendants with minimal criminal records may feel like they have less to lose, but it's ultimately up to the lawyer to decide what's best for their client."

One study on defendant testimony found that 77% of testifying defendants were convicted, compared to 72% who did not testify. However, this study also suggested that defendants with no or minimal criminal records were more likely to testify, potentially due to less risk of exposing a criminal history.

Testifying offers a chance for defendants to convey their state of mind, which is especially crucial in self-defense claims. However, it also comes with risks of cross-examination, which prosecutors may exploit to look for inconsistencies or admissions. Defendants who choose not to testify may also be seen as having something to hide.

Jussie Smollett's decision to testify was considered a disaster by observers, highlighting the gamble of defending oneself in court. Smollett, who was accused of faking a hate crime, took the stand in his own defense but faced intense questioning from prosecutors. His testimony was widely criticized, and he was eventually convicted.

Despite the risks, some defendants have had success with testifying. Kim Potter, who was accused of lying to investigators about her role in a deadly police shooting, took the stand and delivered an emotional testimony. The jury ultimately acquitted her of all charges.

Kyle Rittenhouse, who was accused of murdering two people during a police brutality protest, also chose to testify. His testimony was seen as a key factor in his acquittal, as he convincingly argued that he acted in self-defense.

Travis McMichael, who was accused of murdering an unarmed black man, took the stand and admitted to using excessive force. His testimony may have contributed to his conviction, as the jury found him guilty of manslaughter.

Elizabeth Holmes, who was accused of fraud in her role as CEO of Theranos, took the stand and denied any wrongdoing. Her testimony was seen as a risky move, as prosecutors were able to highlight inconsistencies in her story. She was ultimately convicted.

The trend of defendants taking the stand may continue to grow, as more people become comfortable with the idea of sharing their story publicly. However, it's important to note that testifying is a risky strategy that should be carefully considered by defendants and their lawyers.

In conclusion, the recent trend of defendants taking the stand in high-profile trials reflects a shift in attitudes towards self-defense and the role of social media in legal proceedings. While testifying offers a chance to convey one's state of mind, it also comes with risks of cross-examination and exploitation by prosecutors. Ultimately, the decision to testify should be carefully considered by defendants and their lawyers, as it can make or break a case.
