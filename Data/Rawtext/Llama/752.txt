Safety on Set: Debunking Speculation Surrounding the 'Rust' Tragedy

As a union armorer specializing in Westerns, I've had the privilege of working on numerous film and television productions, ensuring the safe use of firearms on set. The recent fatal shooting on the set of "Rust" has sparked concern and speculation about the safety measures in place. As someone who has dedicated their career to this field, I'd like to provide some insight into the safety protocols that are followed to prevent such incidents.

The shooting on the "Rust" set, which resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza, is described as incredibly rare and tragic. It's important to note that multiple steps and safety measures are in place to avoid accidents with firearms on movie sets.

The process of preparing and using firearms on set is rigorous and meticulous. Most firearms used on film are real, and they require extensive paperwork, permits, and monitoring. Before any firearm is used on set, it's thoroughly inspected to ensure that it's in good working condition and that there are no obstructions in the barrel.

Revolvers and blank rounds are commonly used on set, and they require specific safety protocols. Blank rounds, for instance, are designed to produce a loud noise and a flash of fire but not to fire a projectile. However, they can still cause injury if proper safety measures aren't taken. To prevent this, a detailed description of how revolvers and blank rounds work on set is provided, including safety protocols for using dummy rounds.

Safety measures on set include actor training, rehearsals with "cold" guns, checking for obstructions in the gun barrel, and using protective gear. The author emphasizes the high number of crew members responsible for safety, highlighting the rarity of incidents like the one on "Rust".

Live rounds are generally prohibited on set, with the exception of certain educational scenarios. When live firing is necessary on set, specific protocols are observed, including checking if the chambers are empty and declaring the gun "hot".

Joey Dillon, the author, is identified as a union armorer and expert gun handler based in Los Angeles. With years of experience in the industry, Dillon emphasizes the importance of following safety protocols and the rarity of incidents like the one on "Rust".

"Safety is everyone's number one priority on set," Dillon said. "We take every precaution to ensure that firearms are used safely and responsibly. The incident on 'Rust' is a tragic reminder of how important it is to follow proper safety protocols."
