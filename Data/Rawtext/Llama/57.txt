Interior Department to Investigate Role in Capitol Riot, Coordinating with Other Agencies

The Interior Department's Office of Inspector General has announced that it will investigate the department's role in the events leading up to and during the January 6 Capitol riot. The investigation will be coordinated with parallel probes by the inspectors general of the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Justice.

The violence on January 6 resulted in at least five deaths and raised concerns about security for the upcoming presidential inauguration. The Interior Department, which includes the National Park Service and U.S. Park Police, both of which have law enforcement responsibilities, has come under scrutiny for its preparation and response to the riot.

Representatives from the Park Police and National Park Service have not commented on the investigation. However, Kenneth Spencer, chairman of the US Park Police Fraternal Order of Police, has criticized the Park Police's preparation for potential unrest. Spencer highlighted issues such as outdated equipment, heavy turnover, and difficulty retaining officers.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi has asked retired Army lieutenant general Russell Honoré to lead a review of Capitol security infrastructure. Congressional committees will also conduct oversight related to the attacks and security posture. There is interest in Congress for a 9/11-type commission to assess the events surrounding January 6.

In a statement, Pelosi said, "The safety and security of members of Congress, staff, and the American people is of the utmost importance. We must ensure that the Capitol complex is secure and that we are prepared for any potential threats."

Spencer, in a separate statement, said, "The Park Police are dedicated professionals who put their lives on the line every day to protect the public. However, we need to make sure that they have the resources and support they need to do their job effectively."

The investigation by the Interior Department's Office of Inspector General is expected to focus on the department's role in the events leading up to the riot, as well as its response to the violence. The investigation will also examine whether there were any lapses in security protocols or communication breakdowns that contributed to the violence.

The Capitol riot has raised questions about the adequacy of security measures in place at the Capitol complex. The attack has also highlighted the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in responding to large-scale violent events.

In the aftermath of the riot, there have been calls for increased security measures, including the deployment of National Guard troops and the installation of security fencing around the Capitol complex.

The investigation by the Interior Department's Office of Inspector General is expected to take several weeks to complete. The findings of the investigation will be presented to Congress and the public.

In a statement, the Interior Department said, "The Department of the Interior takes its responsibility to protect the public and ensure the safety of its employees very seriously. We will cooperate fully with the investigation and take any necessary actions to ensure that something like this never happens again."

The investigation is seen as a critical step in ensuring that the Capitol complex is secure and that law enforcement agencies are prepared to respond to any potential threats. The findings of the investigation will also inform efforts to improve security measures and ensure that the Capitol complex is a safe and secure place for members of Congress, staff, and the public.
