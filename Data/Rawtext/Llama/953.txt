Daniel Goldman, Former Federal Prosecutor, Announces Run for New York Attorney General

In a move that could shake up the race for New York Attorney General, former federal prosecutor and counsel to House Democrats in Trump's first impeachment, Daniel Goldman, has announced his candidacy for the position. Goldman, who has had a long and distinguished career in law and law enforcement, is casting himself as a champion of civil rights, equal justice, and democracy in his campaign.

"I am running for Attorney General because I believe that our democracy is under attack," Goldman said in a statement announcing his candidacy. "Trumpism is not just a political ideology, it's a threat to our democratic institutions and the rule of law. As Attorney General, I will fight back against these attacks and ensure that our state remains a beacon of hope and progress for the nation."

Goldman, 45, joins a potentially crowded field for New York AG, with others like Zephyr Teachout and state Sen. Shelley Mayer also running. However, he believes that his experience and commitment to civil rights and criminal justice reform set him apart from the other candidates.

"I have spent my career fighting for justice and standing up to those in power who seek to abuse their positions," Goldman said. "As Attorney General, I will continue to be a champion for civil rights, equal justice, and democracy. I will not be deterred by political pressure or intimidated by the powerful."

Goldman has a strong background in law and law enforcement, having served as a federal prosecutor for 10 years, where he prosecuted organized crime and securities fraud. He also played a major role in Trump's first impeachment trial, serving as counsel to House Democrats.

"I have dedicated my career to fighting for justice and upholding the rule of law," Goldman said. "I have no ambitions beyond being the people's lawyer, and I will focus on the role itself rather than using it as a political springboard."

Goldman has also emphasized the national relevance and authority of the New York Attorney General's Office, saying that he will use the position to combat climate change, protect voting rights, and ensure reproductive rights.

"The New York Attorney General's Office has a long history of being a leader on national issues," Goldman said. "I will continue that tradition and use the office to fight for the rights of all New Yorkers and Americans."

Goldman's campaign announcement has been met with support from many in the legal and political communities, who see him as a strong and capable candidate.

"Dan Goldman is a unifying force who will bring people together to fight for justice and democracy," said former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. "I am confident that he will be a great Attorney General and a champion for all New Yorkers."

In conclusion, Daniel Goldman's announcement to run for New York Attorney General has shaken up the race and brought a new level of excitement and energy to the campaign. With his strong background in law and law enforcement, commitment to civil rights and criminal justice reform, and dedication to upholding democracy, Goldman is a formidable candidate who is sure to make a difference in the race.
