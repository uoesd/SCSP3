Gabby Petito Case: Internet Sleuths Spot Brian Laundrie Reading Novel About Missing Women

In a bizarre twist in the Gabby Petito case, internet sleuths have spotted Brian Laundrie reading a novel about missing women in a video on the couple's YouTube channel. The novel, "Annihilation" by Jeff VanderMeer, tells the story of four women who enter a mysterious area where three disappear and one stays behind.

TikTok user Alyssa Rose was among the first to notice the book in the video and called it "disturbing." She suggested that the police should investigate the connection between the book and Petito's disappearance.

However, not all TikTok users agree that the connection is significant. Some have dismissed the theory as far-fetched, arguing that it's just a coincidence.

The video was uploaded to the "Nomadik Statik" channel on August 19, just a few days before Petito went missing. The novel has also been adapted into a movie, which starred Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh in 2018.
