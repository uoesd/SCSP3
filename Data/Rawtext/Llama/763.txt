'Rust' Executive Producer Defends Involvement, Addresses IATSE Criticism After Fatal On-Set Shooting

In the wake of the tragic shooting on the set of the movie "Rust," executive producer Allen Cheney has come forward to defend his and Emily Salveson's involvement in the production, stating that their roles were limited to financial backing. Cheney's statement addresses the criticism from the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) regarding the hiring of a non-union crew following a walkout.

"We were not involved in the production side of the film, and we did not have any say in the hiring of the crew," Cheney said in a statement. "Our role was strictly limited to providing financial backing for the project."

Cheney's assertion that "Rust" is union-certified and in good standing with major production unions including IATSE, the Teamsters, SAG, and DGA, contradicts IATSE's claim that the production was using a non-union crew.

The tragic incident on the "Rust" set led to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injury of director Joel Souza. Assistant director Dave Halls handed Alec Baldwin the weapon that caused the accident, believing it to be safe.

Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz emphasized the permanent damage caused by accidents on movie sets. "These kinds of accidents can have a lasting impact on the families and loved ones of the victims, and it's important that we take steps to prevent them from happening in the first place," he said.

Legal commentator Nancy Grace suggested that Alec Baldwin could face charges of negligent homicide. "It's important to note that the investigation is still ongoing, but based on the information we have so far, it's possible that Baldwin could face criminal charges," she said.

The production of "Rust" has been halted pending police investigation. The incident has sparked a conversation about safety protocols on film sets, with many calling for stricter regulations and better safety measures to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.

Newsweek attempted to reach Allen Cheney for further comment but did not receive a response.

In a statement, IATSE expressed their condolences to the families of the victims and reiterated their call for better safety measures on film sets. "We will continue to advocate for the safety and well-being of all crew members, and we hope that this tragic incident will serve as a wake-up call for the industry to take safety protocols more seriously," the statement read.

The incident has also sparked a broader conversation about the treatment of crew members on film sets, with many calling for better working conditions and greater respect for the contributions of behind-the-scenes staff.

As the investigation into the "Rust" shooting continues, the industry is bracing for potential changes to safety protocols and regulations. The incident has highlighted the need for greater accountability and transparency on film sets, and many are hopeful that it will lead to positive changes for crew members and the industry as a whole.

In conclusion, the tragic shooting on the set of "Rust" has sent shockwaves through the film industry, highlighting the need for greater safety measures and better working conditions for crew members. While the investigation is ongoing, it is clear that this incident will have a lasting impact on the industry and will serve as a catalyst for change.
