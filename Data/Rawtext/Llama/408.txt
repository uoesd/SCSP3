GUILTY: Derek Chauvin Convicted of Murder and Manslaughter in Death of George Floyd

CNN – Minneapolis, Minnesota – In a landmark trial that has captured the nation's attention, former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin has been found guilty of murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. The guilty verdict was delivered by a jury of 12 people, consisting of 5 men and 7 women, with a racial composition of six White, four Black, and two multiracial jurors.

The jury selection process lasted from March 9 to March 23 at the Hennepin County Government Center, with both the defense and prosecution using peremptory challenges to shape the jury based on views on policing and Black Lives Matter. Two alternate jurors, both White women, were dismissed before deliberations began.

George Floyd died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, a White former Minneapolis Police officer, kneeled on his neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds. Chauvin faces up to 40 years for second-degree murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter. Sentencing is scheduled for eight weeks from the trial, to be decided by Judge Peter Cahill.

The trial included testimony from 45 witnesses over approximately three weeks. The prosecution argued that Chauvin's actions were unreasonable and violated police protocol, while the defense claimed that Chauvin acted in accordance with his training and the situation called for the use of force.

Three other former officers are charged with aiding and abetting in the case and are expected to stand trial. The conviction of Derek Chauvin marks a significant moment in the nation's ongoing conversation about police brutality and systemic racism.

In the wake of the verdict, many are calling for continued protests and activism to bring attention to the systemic issues that led to George Floyd's death. The fight for justice is far from over, and the guilty verdict is just the beginning of a long road towards true reform and accountability.
