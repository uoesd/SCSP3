Stimulus Checks: No Fourth Round Planned as Congress Shifts Focus

Washington CNN – As Americans continue to recover from the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is currently no proposal for a fourth round of stimulus checks, according to sources on Capitol Hill. Despite some Democratic support for recurring payments, slim majorities and a previous focus on limiting the third round of payments make further direct payments unlikely.

Instead, lawmakers are now concentrating on a massive infrastructure bill and President Biden's American Families Plan, neither of which includes direct payments. The Internal Revenue Service is still making payment adjustments for those who lost income in 2020 and are due more from the third round of payments. These plus-up payments are automatically going to individuals whose 2020 tax returns show they qualified for more based on their income.

However, there is some good news for families with children. The expanded child tax credit payments, as part of the pandemic aid package passed in March, will begin on July 15. More than 36 million families are eligible for the child tax credit payments, which will be periodic. Eligible parents will receive up to $3,600 for each child under 6 and $3,000 for each child under 18, an increase from the previous maximum of $2,000.

The enhanced child tax credit will benefit single parents making up to $75,000 and joint filers making up to $150,000 a year. Additionally, the child tax credit has been made fully refundable, potentially benefiting 20 million more children. This means that even if a family's tax liability is zero, they will still receive the full amount of the credit.

The child tax credit payments are part of President Biden's American Rescue Plan, which aims to provide relief to families who have been struggling financially during the pandemic. The expanded credit is expected to lift 5 million children out of poverty and provide relief to millions more families who are struggling to make ends meet.

While the lack of a fourth round of stimulus checks may be disappointing for some, the expanded child tax credit payments are a welcome relief for families with children. As the country continues to recover from the pandemic, lawmakers will continue to monitor the economic situation and consider further relief measures as needed.

In conclusion, while there are currently no plans for a fourth round of stimulus checks, the expanded child tax credit payments will provide much-needed relief to millions of families with children. As the pandemic continues to impact the economy, lawmakers will continue to work towards providing support to those who need it most.
