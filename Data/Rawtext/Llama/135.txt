Rick Santorum Out at CNN After Controversial Remarks on Native Americans

CNN — – Rick Santorum, a former US senator and conservative commentator, is no longer with CNN following his controversial remarks about Native Americans. The network confirmed his departure on Thursday, but did not provide further details.

Santorum sparked significant backlash in April when he stated that the US was "birthed from nothing" and minimized the contribution of Native American culture to American culture. His comments were met with criticism from the Native American Journalists Association and calls for his firing.

In an appearance on "Cuomo Prime Time," Santorum defended himself, saying he misspoke and acknowledging the mistreatment of Native Americans, but did not apologize for his initial remarks. His defense of the comments was met with dissatisfaction within CNN, leading to his departure from the network.

Santorum's remarks and subsequent defense led to him being "benched" as none of the anchors wanted to book him. This is not the first time a commentator has left CNN amid controversy, with Jeffery Lord and Paris Dennard being notable past cases.

Santorum was known for being an outspoken supporter of the Trump agenda on CNN. His departure from the network comes as a surprise to many, as he was a frequent contributor to the network's political coverage.

Santorum did not immediately respond to requests for comment on his departure from CNN. His exit from the network is effective immediately, and it is unclear what his future plans are.

The controversy surrounding Santorum's remarks highlights the ongoing issue of diversity and inclusion in media. The Native American Journalists Association released a statement condemning Santorum's comments, saying, "His words perpetuate harmful stereotypes and erase the rich cultural heritage of Native Americans."

CNN has faced criticism in the past for its lack of diversity in its commentator lineup. The network has made efforts to address this issue, but the departure of Santorum raises questions about the network's commitment to diversity and inclusion.

Santorum's departure from CNN is a significant loss for the network, as he was a prominent conservative voice on the channel. His exit leaves a void in the network's political coverage, and it remains to be seen who will fill his role.

The controversy surrounding Santorum's remarks also raises questions about the role of commentators in media. Commentators are hired to provide analysis and opinion, but their comments can also spark controversy and backlash.

In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of commentators leaving their jobs amid controversy. Jeffery Lord, a conservative commentator, was fired from CNN in 2017 after he tweeted a Nazi salute. Paris Dennard, another conservative commentator, was fired from CNN in 2018 after he made controversial comments about sexual assault.

Santorum's departure from CNN is a reminder that commentators have a responsibility to be mindful of their words and their impact on others. The network's decision to part ways with Santorum sends a message that controversial comments will not be tolerated.

In a statement, a CNN spokesperson confirmed Santorum's departure, saying, "We thank Rick for his contributions to CNN, but we have decided to part ways with him. We wish him the best in his future endeavors."

The spokesperson did not provide further details on the reason for Santorum's departure, but it is clear that his controversial remarks played a role in the network's decision.

Santorum's departure from CNN is a significant development in the world of political commentary. His exit from the network leaves a void in the political commentary space, and it remains to be seen who will fill his role.

The controversy surrounding Santorum's remarks also highlights the ongoing issue of diversity and inclusion in media. The departure of Santorum raises questions about the network's commitment to diversity and inclusion, and it remains to be seen how CNN will address these issues in the future.
