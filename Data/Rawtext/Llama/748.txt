Shannon Lee highlighted the outpouring of love for her brother as bittersweet but hopes it leads to meaningful change. "It's heartening to see the support for my brother and the call for change, but it's also a reminder of the tragedy that we've been living with for 28 years," she said. "I hope that Halyna's death is not in vain and that it leads to real action and change in the industry."

The "Rust" shooting incident has sparked a renewed focus on safety protocols and the use of firearms on film sets, with many calling for a ban on real guns and a greater emphasis on the use of special effects. As the industry grapples with this tragedy, the Lee family's advocacy for change serves as a poignant reminder of the need for greater safety measures to prevent future tragedies.
