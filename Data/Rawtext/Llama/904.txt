Tampa Bay Buccaneers to Raise Season Ticket Prices by Up to 45% for 2021 Season

TAMPA – The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, fresh off their Super Bowl victory, have announced a significant increase in season ticket prices for the 2021 season. The price hike, which ranges from 10 to 45 percent, follows a surge in demand after the team signed quarterback Tom Brady in 2020.

"It's a great time to be a Buccaneers fan," said Bucs Coach Bruce Arians. "We're coming off a championship season, and we're excited to see the energy and enthusiasm from our fans carry over into the 2021 season."

The price increase is also attributed to the elimination of 3,000 seats in the 300 level, which were previously offered at half price to youths. This change, along with over $150 million in stadium renovations and alignment with league pricing models, has contributed to the highest increase in ticket prices.

"We're committed to providing our fans with the best possible experience, and that includes investing in our stadium and ensuring that our ticket prices are aligned with the rest of the league," said Bucs Chief Operating Officer Brian Ford.

Despite the price increase, the Bucs claim to offer one of the most affordable average ticket prices in the NFL. "We understand that affordability is important to our fans, and we've worked hard to ensure that our ticket prices remain competitive," said Ford.

The 2020 season saw limited fan attendance at games due to pandemic restrictions, with stadium capacity at about 15,600. However, the team is aiming to fill the 65,000-seat Raymond James Stadium for the 2021 season.

"Winning a Super Bowl during a pandemic was a daunting task, but our fans were with us every step of the way," said General Manager Jason Licht. "We're excited to have them back in full force for the 2021 season."

The secondary market for Bucs tickets in the next season could see even higher price increases. "We're expecting a high demand for tickets, especially after our championship season," said Ford. "Fans who want to secure their seats for the 2021 season should act quickly."

In a letter to season ticket holders, Arians and Licht expressed their gratitude for the fans' support and promised an exciting season ahead. "We're looking forward to building on our success and bringing another championship to Tampa Bay," said Arians.

The price increase for season tickets is as follows:

  • 10% increase for tickets in the lower demand areas (200 and 300 levels)
  • 20% increase for tickets in the middle demand areas (100 and 200 levels)
  • 45% increase for tickets in the highest demand areas (50 and 100 levels)

Season ticket holders will receive an email with detailed information on the price increase and their options for renewal. The deadline for renewal is March 15.

The Bucs are set to face off against the Dallas Cowboys in their first home game of the 2021 season on September 19. With a revamped stadium and a reignited passion for football in Tampa Bay, the 2021 season is shaping up to be an exciting one for both the team and its fans.
