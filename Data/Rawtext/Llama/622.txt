Harris Slams Trump's 'Abuse of Power' in Georgia Election Interference

Vice President-elect Kamala Harris criticized President Donald Trump for his recent phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he urged the official to overturn the state's election results. Harris described the call as a "bald-faced, bold abuse of power" during a drive-thru rally in Savannah, Georgia.

The recorded conversation between Trump and Raffensperger was obtained by CNN and reported by the Washington Post. Senior adviser to President-elect Joe Biden, Bob Bauer, called the call a "disgraceful story about Donald Trump's assault on American democracy."

Harris highlighted the failed attempts by Trump and other Republicans to overturn the election results on baseless voter fraud allegations. "The president's efforts to undermine the integrity of our democracy are a threat to our nation's very foundation," she said.

Harris emphasized Georgia's role in electing Biden and herself, criticizing the opposition's questioning of the electoral process. "The people of Georgia have spoken, and their voices must be heard," she said. "It's time for the president and his allies to respect the will of the people and accept the results of this election."

Trump's January 2 audio call with Raffensperger, along with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and several lawyers, was leaked and reported. In the call, Trump pressured Raffensperger to "find" enough votes to overturn Biden's victory in Georgia.

Harris condemned Trump's claims that the January 5 Senate runoff elections were "illegal and invalid." "These baseless allegations are a desperate attempt to undermine the democratic process and discredit the will of the people," she said.

Harris, addressing future representation, expressed concern over the absence of a Black woman in the Senate after her resignation. "It's crucial that we continue to have diverse representation in our government, especially in the Senate," she said. "We must ensure that the voices of all Americans are heard and represented."

Senate candidate Jon Ossoff accused Trump of attempting to disenfranchise Black voters and criticized Sens. Perdue and Loeffler for not defending Georgia voters. "It's unconscionable that the president would try to silence the voices of Black voters in Georgia," he said. "We must stand up against these attacks on our democracy and ensure that every voice is heard."

Harris's comments come as Trump continues to face backlash for his attempts to overturn the election results. The president's actions have been widely criticized by Democrats and some Republicans, who argue that he is undermining the integrity of the democratic process.

In a statement, Bauer called Trump's actions "a direct attack on the rule of law and the principles of democracy." He added, "The president's efforts to manipulate the election results are a threat to our nation's very foundation."

Harris's remarks also highlight the ongoing battle for representation in the Senate. The vice president-elect has been a vocal advocate for diversity and inclusion in government, and her comments on the importance of Black representation in the Senate reflect her commitment to ensuring that all voices are heard.

As the nation continues to grapple with the fallout of the 2020 election, Harris's words serve as a reminder of the importance of protecting our democracy and ensuring that every voice is heard. The vice president-elect's leadership and commitment to diversity and inclusion are a beacon of hope for a brighter, more equitable future.
