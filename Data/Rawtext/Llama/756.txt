'The Rookie' Bans Live Weapons on Set After 'Rust' Shooting

CNN – In the wake of the fatal shooting on the set of the movie "Rust," ABC's television series "The Rookie" has announced that it will no longer use live weapons on set.

In a letter issued to the cast and crew, showrunner Alexi Hawley explained that the decision was made in response to the incident on the "Rust" set, where cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed when a prop gun containing live rounds was discharged.

"We take the safety of our cast and crew very seriously, and we have decided to ban the use of live weapons on set," Hawley wrote. "We will be using Airsoft guns instead, and will add any necessary effects in post-production."

Weapons expert Ben Simmons, who has worked on numerous film and television productions, including "The Rookie," categorizes prop guns into three categories: fake, deactivated, and real firearms. He emphasizes the importance of proper training and safety protocols when handling any type of weapon on set.

"It's crucial that actors and crew members are trained on the proper use and handling of weapons, and that they understand the potential risks involved," Simmons said. "The use of live weapons on set can be dangerous, and it's important to take every precaution to ensure the safety of everyone involved."

The decision to ban live weapons on the set of "The Rookie" was influenced by the incident on the "Rust" set, where assistant director David Halls unknowingly handed actor Alec Baldwin a gun with live rounds, resulting in the fatal shooting of Hutchins.

"The safety of our cast and crew is our top priority, and we are taking this step to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent a tragedy like the one on 'Rust' from happening on our set," Hawley said.

CNN has reached out to ABC and "The Rookie" representatives for comment, but has not received a response at this time.

The investigation into the "Rust" shooting incident is still ongoing, and it is not yet clear how the live rounds ended up in the prop gun that was used in the scene.

In a recent interview, Baldwin revealed that he was told the prop gun was a "cold gun" before the fatal shooting, meaning that it did not contain any live rounds. However, Halls has admitted that he did not properly check the gun before handing it to Baldwin.

The incident on the "Rust" set has sparked a conversation about the use of live weapons on film and television productions, and many have called for stricter safety protocols to be put in place.

"The use of live weapons on set is a risky business, and it's important that we take every precaution to ensure the safety of everyone involved," Simmons said. "I applaud 'The Rookie' for taking this step to protect their cast and crew."

The decision to ban live weapons on the set of "The Rookie" is a significant one, and it is likely that other productions will follow suit in the wake of the "Rust" tragedy.

In conclusion, the fatal shooting on the set of "Rust" has prompted a re-evaluation of safety protocols on film and television productions, and the decision by "The Rookie" to ban live weapons on set is a positive step towards ensuring the safety of cast and crew members.
