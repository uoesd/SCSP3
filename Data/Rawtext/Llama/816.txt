IRS Begins Distributing Second Stimulus Checks, but Recipients Are Uncertain About Arrival Dates

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has started distributing the second round of stimulus checks, offering $600 for each eligible adult and child. However, many recipients are uncertain about the exact arrival of their checks due to the IRS' "Get My Payment" website being offline.

"The IRS has begun distributing the second round of stimulus checks, and direct deposits have started and will continue into the week," said Mark Steber, chief tax information officer at Jackson Hewitt. "Paper checks began mailing on December 30 for those without bank information on file."

The second stimulus follows a first round from the CARES Act, which had issues such as delayed payments for those without bank info on file. The IRS will distribute funds using the same methods as the first round, according to Steber.

The "Get My Payment" tool is expected to resume operation next week, also tracking both the first and second stimulus payments. Automatic payments will be made to those who filed a 2019 tax return, receive specific government benefits, or used the Non-Filers tool by November 21.

The payments are not taxable, and recipients are advised to keep IRS Notice 1444 for any additional amount due on their 2020 tax return.

Senate Majority Leader McConnell blocked a vote to increase the stimulus checks to $2,000, as requested by President Trump. The second stimulus allows more people to be eligible, including mixed-status households previously denied under the CARES Act.

"The second stimulus is a welcome relief for many Americans who are struggling financially during this pandemic," said Steber. "It's important for recipients to keep an eye on their bank accounts and mailboxes, as the payments are being distributed automatically."

The IRS urges taxpayers to not call the agency or their financial institutions for information about their stimulus payments. Instead, they can use the "Get My Payment" tool to check the status of their payment and confirm their eligibility.

The second stimulus check is part of a larger relief package signed into law by President Trump on December 27. The package includes extended unemployment benefits, small business loans, and funding for vaccine distribution and testing.

As the pandemic continues to affect the economy, the second stimulus check is seen as a vital lifeline for many Americans. The IRS is working to distribute the payments as quickly and efficiently as possible, with the majority of payments expected to be issued by the end of next week.

In conclusion, the second stimulus check is a much-needed relief for many Americans who are struggling financially during this pandemic. Although there have been some issues with the "Get My Payment" website, the IRS is working to distribute the payments as quickly and efficiently as possible. Recipients are advised to keep an eye on their bank accounts and mailboxes, and to use the "Get My Payment" tool to check the status of their payment and confirm their eligibility.
