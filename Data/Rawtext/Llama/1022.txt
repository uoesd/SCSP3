Cruz Faces Backlash for Cancun Trip During Texas Storm Crisis

DALLAS (AP) – Texas Senator Ted Cruz is facing intense criticism for taking a family vacation to Mexico while his home state was battered by a deadly winter storm, leaving millions without power and water.

Cruz acknowledged on Thursday that the trip was a mistake, saying he had initially planned to stay in Cancun through the weekend but returned early to focus on the state's crisis.

"I was trying to be a good dad," Cruz said in a statement. "My daughters asked to go, and I wanted to take them. I didn't want them to miss out on the opportunity to see their friends."

But the damage had already been done, as photos of Cruz and his family at the Cancun airport circulated on social media, sparking outrage from both Republicans and Democrats.

"It's unacceptable for a public official to abandon their responsibilities during a crisis," said Texas GOP Chair Allen West. "We need leaders who will put the needs of their constituents first, not their own personal desires."

The controversy has raised questions about Cruz's political future, including his potential 2024 presidential run.

"This is a serious blow to Cruz's credibility," said political analyst Mark Jones. "He's always been known for his strong conservative values, but this just looks like he's out of touch with the people he's supposed to represent."

Meanwhile, the storm's aftermath has left Texas reeling, with over 7 million residents advised to boil their water before drinking it due to infrastructure damage.

"The government's response has been unacceptable," said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. "We need to do better to support the people of Texas during this crisis."

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki also weighed in, saying, "We're closely monitoring the situation in Texas and are working with state and local officials to provide assistance."

Cruz's office contacted the Houston Police Department about his return, but it's unclear if this was a typical procedure.

"We don't typically comment on the travel plans of public officials," said Jodi Silva, a spokesperson for the department. "Our focus is on helping those affected by the storm."

As the controversy continues to swirl, it remains to be seen how Cruz's actions will impact his political future. One thing is certain, however: this trip has left a stain on his reputation that may be difficult to overcome.
