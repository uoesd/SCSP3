UK's Evacuation from Kabul Airport Nears End as US Deadline Looms

The United Kingdom's evacuation efforts from Kabul airport are in their final stages, with the deadline for withdrawal fast approaching. Despite failing to persuade the US to extend the August 31st deadline, the UK continues to work tirelessly to evacuate as many people as possible.

Nick Reynolds, a defense expert at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, highlighted the challenges faced by the UK in maintaining operations at the airport. "The UK can't maintain Kabul airport operations without the US. It's simply not possible. We don't have the sufficient troops, air traffic control, intelligence, surveillance, and air protection to do it," he said.

The urgency of the situation was underscored by two explosions at the airport, which killed 90 people. However, the UK's withdrawal pace remained unchanged, with a focus on evacuating as many people as possible before the deadline.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the scale and complexity of the evacuation mission, stating that only the US had the capabilities to manage it. "The United States is the only country that can manage a mission of this scale and complexity. We have the resources, the expertise, and the military might to make it happen," he said.

The UK has evacuated over 13,000 people so far, but acknowledges that not everyone eligible has been evacuated. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace mentioned loosening passenger number limits to maximize evacuations, leaving some military equipment behind. "We're doing everything we can to get as many people out as possible. We're working tirelessly to make sure that we can evacuate as many people as we can," he said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson anticipates a 'second phase' for further evacuations under a reasonable approach with the Taliban. "We will continue to work with our international partners to ensure that those who are eligible for evacuation are able to leave. We will also work with the Taliban to ensure that they understand the importance of allowing people to leave peacefully," he said.

President Joe Biden remains resolute in his decision to leave by August 31st, depending on the Taliban's 'self-interest' for airport perimeter security. "The Taliban have a self-interest in maintaining security at the airport. They understand that if they allow us to leave peacefully, it will be beneficial for them in the long run," he said.

As the deadline looms, the UK and its allies continue to work tirelessly to evacuate as many people as possible. Despite the challenges, the international community remains committed to ensuring the safety and security of those who remain in Afghanistan.

In conclusion, the UK's evacuation from Kabul airport is in its final stages, with a focus on maximizing evacuations before the August 31st deadline. While the challenges are significant, the international community remains committed to ensuring the safety and security of those who remain in Afghanistan.
