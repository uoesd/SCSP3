Phoebe Arthur, a 14-year-old survivor of the Oxford High School shooting, has been released from Hurley Medical Center, her family announced on Thursday. Phoebe was shot in the chest and neck during the November 30 shooting that killed four students and injured seven others.

"We are thrilled to announce that Phoebe has been released from the hospital," said Sandy Cunningham, Phoebe's mother. "She still has a long road to recovery ahead of her, but we are grateful for the progress she has made so far."

A GoFundMe page set up by Phoebe's family has raised approximately $75,258 of a $100,000 goal to cover trauma-related expenses. The page has received donations and messages of support from across the country.

"We are overwhelmed by the generosity and support we have received from our community and beyond," said Naomi Ernest, Phoebe's cousin and the organizer of the GoFundMe page. "It has been a difficult time for our family, but knowing that we have such a strong support system has made all the difference."

Phoebe's recovery has been nothing short of miraculous, according to her family. She has made significant progress, such as sitting up, walking, and even taking laps around the pediatric unit.

"It's amazing to see how far Phoebe has come," said Cunningham. "She still has a lot of healing to do, but we are so proud of her strength and resilience."

In addition to Phoebe's GoFundMe page, a total of eight verified GoFundMe pages have been set up in relation to the Oxford shooting. One of the pages is for another survivor, Aiden Watson, who was also injured in the shooting.

Aiden's GoFundMe page highlights the start of his recovery journey and the missed opportunity to join the high school swim team due to the shooting. The page has raised over $75,177.

"We are grateful for the support we have received from our community and beyond," said Michelle Carter-Johnston, Aiden's cousin and the organizer of his GoFundMe page. "It has been a difficult time for our family, but knowing that we have such a strong support system has made all the difference."

Philanthropist Bill Pulte, the CEO of Pulte Capital, has also urged his 3.2 million followers to support the GoFundMe pages benefitting Oxford families.

"My heart goes out to the families affected by the Oxford shooting," said Pulte. "I encourage everyone to donate to the verified GoFundMe pages set up for the victims and their families. Every little bit helps in their recovery journey."
