Gabby Petito Remembered as 'Super Kind-Hearted' by Surf Shop Owner as Search for Brian Laundrie Continues

Gabby Petito, the 22-year-old woman who was found dead in Wyoming's Teton-Bridger National Forest, was remembered by a surf shop owner in her Long Island hometown as a "super kind-hearted, sweet girl." The surf shop owner, who wished to remain anonymous, spoke to Fox News about Petito's friendly demeanor and love for the outdoors.

"Gabby was a longtime customer of ours, and she was always smiling," the surf shop owner said. "She had a passion for surfing and the beach, and she was always eager to share her adventures with us. She was a super kind-hearted, sweet girl, and we're all devastated by her loss."

Petito's remains were found on September 21, and her death was ruled a homicide by the Teton County Coroner. She had been missing since September 1, when her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, returned to Florida without her. Laundrie has been named a person of interest in Petito's disappearance and is currently being sought by authorities.

Petito and Laundrie had embarked on a cross-country road trip in June, traveling from Florida to New York and then towards western national parks. They visited the surf shop in early July, where Petito bought a shirt for Laundrie.

"Gabby was so excited to be on this trip and to explore the country," the surf shop owner said. "She was always talking about how much she loved the outdoors and how she wanted to live life to the fullest. She was such a creative and artistic person, and she had a spark in her eye that was just infectious."

Petito's white van was seized from Laundrie's family home on September 11, and authorities are currently searching for Laundrie in a Florida nature reserve and other locations.

Nichole Schmidt, Petito's mother, spoke to Fox News about her daughter's love for adventure and her desire to explore the world.

"Gabby was always a free spirit, and she loved to try new things," Schmidt said. "She was always up for an adventure, and she had a heart of gold. She was the kind of person who would go out of her way to help someone in need, and she had a smile that could light up a room."

Schmidt also expressed her gratitude for the support her family has received during this difficult time.

"We're so grateful for the outpouring of love and support we've received from the community," Schmidt said. "Gabby was a special person, and she touched so many lives. We're just trying to stay strong and keep her memory alive."

As the search for Laundrie continues, the surf shop owner echoed Schmidt's sentiments, saying that Petito's memory will live on through the countless lives she touched.

"Gabby was a shining light, and she left a mark on everyone she met," the surf shop owner said. "We're all better for having known her, and we'll never forget her spirit and her love for life."
