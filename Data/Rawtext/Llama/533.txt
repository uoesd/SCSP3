Deadly Suicide Bombings Rock Kabul Airport Amid Evacuation Efforts

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) – At least 60 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops were killed in a coordinated suicide bombing and gunfire attack on crowds gathered at Kabul's airport, officials said Thursday. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the assault, which also wounded more than 140 Afghans.

U.S. President Joe Biden vowed to retaliate against the perpetrators, saying in a statement, "We will hunt you down and make you pay." Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, assured that evacuations would continue despite the attacks, stating, "We will not be deterred by these cowardly attacks."

The Taliban condemned the blasts and was not believed to be involved in the attack, according to Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. Italy's Emergency charity, which operates a hospital in Kabul, reported receiving at least 60 patients wounded in the airport attack, said Marco Puntin, the charity's manager in Afghanistan.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby and Gen. McKenzie acknowledged a security breach at the airport, but gave no details. Several countries, including the United States, Britain, and Germany, advised against going to the Kabul airport due to unspecified security threats.

The attacks occurred amidst efforts to evacuate people following the Taliban's takeover and ahead of the U.S. withdrawal deadline of Aug. 31. Acting U.S. ambassador to Kabul, Ross Wilson, expressed his condolences to the families of the victims, saying, "We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure the safety and security of all Americans and Afghans who are seeking to leave the country."

The airport has been the site of chaotic scenes in recent days, with thousands of Afghans trying to flee the country following the Taliban's takeover. The U.S. and other countries have been working to evacuate their citizens and vulnerable Afghans, but the process has been slow and dangerous.

The attacks are a stark reminder of the dangers facing those trying to flee the country, and the challenges facing the international community in ensuring their safety. The U.S. and its allies have vowed to continue their efforts to evacuate those in need, despite the security risks.
