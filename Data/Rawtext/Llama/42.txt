Tensions Run High as Supreme Court Justices Skip Biden's Inauguration

The inauguration of President Joe Biden was a historic moment, but it was also marked by notable absences. For the first time in over 20 years, not all Supreme Court Justices attended the swearing-in ceremony. Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito Jr. did not attend due to public health concerns amid the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg.

The Supreme Court has been operating remotely since March, only gathering in person once for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's memorial service. Despite this, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. administered the presidential oath to Biden, despite both having opposed Roberts' confirmation in the past. Justice Sonia Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President Kamala Harris, marking a series of firsts for both officials.

However, the absence of some justices at the inauguration hints at enduring political and personal tensions. Former senators Biden and Harris have historically voted against the confirmation of six out of the nine current Supreme Court justices. Biden's attempts to filibuster Alito's nomination and his role in Clarence Thomas's contentious confirmation hearing reflect a history of tension.

Thomas has publicly criticized Biden's conduct during his confirmation hearings, particularly concerning questions about natural law. Despite past confrontations, Biden reached out to Anita Hill, who accused Thomas of sexual harassment, to express regret for her treatment during the hearings.

The tensions between Biden and Thomas date back to 1991, when Biden, then the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, presided over Thomas's confirmation hearing. Biden has since acknowledged that he did not do enough to support Hill during the hearing.

In a 2019 interview with The New York Times, Thomas criticized Biden's role in the hearing, saying, "I felt like I was in a lion's den, and I was the lion." Thomas also accused Biden of using the hearing as a platform to launch his own political career.

Despite these past confrontations, Biden reached out to Anita Hill in 2019 to express regret for her treatment during the hearings. In an interview with The New York Times, Hill said that Biden had called her to apologize and express his regret for how she was treated during the hearing.

The absence of some justices at the inauguration is not the only sign of tension between the Supreme Court and the Biden administration. In November, Chief Justice Roberts issued a rare statement criticizing President Biden's comments about the Supreme Court, in which he accused the court of being "out of touch" with the American people.

Roberts' statement was seen as a response to Biden's criticism of the court's decision in a case involving the Trump administration's "public charge" rule, which allows the government to deny green cards to immigrants who use certain public benefits. Biden had called the decision "outrageous" and "a threat to our democracy."

In his statement, Roberts defended the court's independence and impartiality, saying, "We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."

The tensions between the Supreme Court and the Biden administration are likely to continue, as the court is set to hear several high-profile cases in the coming months that could have significant implications for the administration's policies.

In conclusion, the absence of some Supreme Court Justices at President Biden's inauguration is a reflection of the enduring political and personal tensions between the court and the administration. While the court has been operating remotely due to the pandemic, the tensions between the two branches of government are unlikely to dissipate anytime soon.
