Islamic State in Khorasan Attacks Taliban Forces in Afghanistan, Threatening Stability

Sept 23 (Reuters) – The Islamic State in Khorasan (ISIS-K) has launched a series of attacks on Taliban forces in Afghanistan, using guerrilla tactics similar to those previously employed by the Taliban. Despite the Taliban's efforts to minimize the threat, the attacks have highlighted the ongoing instability in the region.

In a recent attack, ISIS-K militants targeted Kabul's international airport, killing several civilians and military personnel. The group has also claimed responsibility for a series of bomb blasts in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid downplayed the threat posed by ISIS-K, stating that the group is "not a major concern" for the Taliban. However, Taliban commanders have expressed concern over ISIS-K's tactics, particularly their use of sticky bombs.

ISIS-K has suffered significant losses since its peak around 2018, with both Taliban and U.S. forces targeting the group. This has led to a decline in its activities, but the group still poses a threat to stability in the region.

According to Taliban security forces, three ISIS-K members were killed in a recent clash, indicating ongoing conflict between the two groups. Analysts and the United Nations believe that the return of the Taliban to power may invigorate extremist groups like ISIS-K and al Qaeda.

ISIS-K's strength is estimated to be under 2,000 fighters, significantly fewer than the Taliban's forces. The group's recruits include former Taliban members and fighters from the Pakistani Taliban (TTP).

Financial and logistical support to ISIS-K from its parent organization in Syria is believed to have considerably reduced. However, the UN report suggests that internal divisions within the Taliban could lead to defections to ISIS-K, potentially bolstering its ranks.

Rohan Gunaratna, a Professor of security studies at Nanyang Technological University, stated that "ISIS-K remains a significant threat to regional stability, despite its decline in recent years." He added that "the group's ability to launch guerrilla attacks and recruit new members poses a challenge to the Taliban's efforts to establish a stable government."

The ongoing conflict between the Taliban and ISIS-K highlights the complex nature of extremism in the region. While the Taliban has made efforts to present itself as a legitimate government, the presence of groups like ISIS-K undermines its claims to stability and security.

In conclusion, the attacks by ISIS-K on Taliban forces in Afghanistan highlight the ongoing threat to stability in the region. Despite the Taliban's efforts to minimize the threat, the group's guerrilla tactics and recruitment of new members pose a significant challenge to regional security. The international community must remain vigilant in its efforts to combat extremism and support the establishment of a stable government in Afghanistan.
