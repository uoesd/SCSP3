Colin Powell, Trailblazing Statesman and Military Leader, Dies at 84

WASHINGTON – Colin Luther Powell, the first African American to serve as U.S. Secretary of State, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and national security advisor, passed away on Tuesday due to complications from Covid-19. He was 84.

A family spokesperson confirmed Powell's death, stating that he had been fully vaccinated but had underlying health conditions, including Parkinson's disease and multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. Despite his health challenges, Powell remained active and engaged in public life until his death.

Powell's distinguished career in public service spanned over five decades, during which he served under four U.S. presidents. He was appointed Secretary of State by President George W. Bush in 2001, becoming the first African American to hold the position. Prior to that, he served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Bush's father, President George H.W. Bush. Powell also served as national security advisor to President Ronald Reagan.

Tributes have poured in from leaders across the political spectrum, including former Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and contemporary Condoleezza Rice, who succeeded Powell at the State Department. President Joe Biden ordered flags to be lowered in Powell's honor, describing him as embodying the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat.

In a statement, former President George W. Bush praised Powell as a "great leader, a great soldier, and a great statesman." Powell's successor at the State Department, Condoleezza Rice, lauded him as a "superb diplomat and a great American." Former President Barack Obama hailed Powell as an "exemplary soldier, statesman, and leader."

Despite identifying as a Republican, Powell endorsed Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in their presidential campaigns. He admitted that his support for the Iraq War, which began in 2003, haunted him and considered it a blot on his record.

Powell was the son of Jamaican immigrants and made history as the first Black person to serve as national security advisor. His role in arguing for the U.S.'s invasion of Iraq was seen as a significant aspect of his legacy, despite his later regrets. The Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq, supported by Powell's UN speech claiming Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, was later criticized as an intelligence failure.

In a heartfelt tribute, former First Lady Laura Bush remembered Powell as a "dear friend" and a "dedicated public servant." She praised his commitment to justice and equality, saying, "He broke barriers and paved the way for others to follow."

Powell's legacy extends beyond his impressive résumé. He was a trailblazer, paving the way for future generations of leaders from diverse backgrounds. His dedication to public service, diplomacy, and military leadership will be remembered and celebrated for years to come.
