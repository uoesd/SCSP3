QAnon Supporters Spread Baseless Conspiracies About Ever Given Ship, Despite Fact-Checking and Evidence

The recent grounding of the Ever Given ship in the Suez Canal has sparked a flurry of conspiracy theories among QAnon supporters, who claim that the ship was operated by Hillary Clinton and carried child sex slaves. Despite fact-checking and evidence debunking these claims, the theories continue to proliferate on fringe platforms like Telegram and Gab.

The conspiracy theories began circulating after QAnon followers noticed that the ship's Taiwanese operator, Evergreen, shared a similar name to Clinton's secret service name, "H3RC." They also pointed to the ship's call sign, "H3RC," claiming that it was a clear reference to Clinton's initials. However, experts have confirmed that the name and call sign are simply a coincidence, and that there is no evidence linking the ship to Clinton or human trafficking.

Daniel Funke, an expert in online misinformation at PolitiFact, stated, "There's no evidence to support the claim that the Ever Given ship was operated by Hillary Clinton or that it was involved in human trafficking. These conspiracy theories are completely baseless."

Despite the lack of evidence, QAnon followers have continued to develop more intricate and baseless theories about the ship. Some have claimed that the ship's captain was in on the alleged human trafficking scheme, while others have pointed to the ship's pre-canal course, which they claim resembles a crude drawing.

A spokesperson for vesselfinder.com, a website that tracks ship movements, confirmed the accuracy of the ship's tracking data, dismissing conspiracy theories. "The ship's course and movements are entirely normal and consistent with its intended route," they stated.

One popular theory among QAnon followers suggests that the ship's computers were hacked by those supportive of the QAnon cause, framing the incident as part of a larger plan. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and experts have confirmed that the ship's systems were not compromised.

QAnon theories have also symbolically linked the Suez Canal to a birthing canal, indicating a forthcoming revelation against the deep state. Old QAnon posts mentioning to "watch the water" have been reused as alleged proofs of the conspiracy's validity.

An elaborate "proof" board on a QAnon message board connected unconnected facts about the ship to QAnon prophecies, further fueling the conspiracy theories. However, experts have repeatedly emphasized that there is no evidence to support these claims.

The spread of these conspiracy theories highlights the ongoing challenge of combating misinformation and disinformation online. Despite fact-checking efforts, baseless theories continue to proliferate on fringe platforms, often fueled by confirmation bias and a desire for sensationalism.

In conclusion, the conspiracy theories surrounding the Ever Given ship are entirely baseless and have been repeatedly debunked by experts. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of fact-checking and critical thinking in the digital age, and the need to combat misinformation and disinformation online.
