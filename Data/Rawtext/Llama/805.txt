Stimulus Update: IRS Issues "Plus-Up" Payments to Millions of Americans

Washington – The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been working tirelessly to distribute additional stimulus cash to those who lost income in 2020, with over 1 million "plus-up" payments totaling $2.5 billion issued over the past two weeks. These payments are part of the third stimulus round, authorized in March, which aims to provide up to $1,400 per person to 85% of households.

The "plus-up" payments target individuals whose 2020 tax returns indicate they qualified for more than they initially received from the first two stimulus rounds. The IRS has sent out more than 8 million supplemental payments this year, with another 900,000 payments made to low-income individuals who don't typically file tax returns but did so this year to claim their stimulus money.

The third stimulus payment offers up to $1,400 per person and is expected to reach 85% of households. Families can receive $1,400 per dependent, including for adult dependents over 17, with the amount phasing out at higher income levels.

In addition to the stimulus payments, the latest aid package increases the child tax credit, with periodic payments beginning July 15, based on 2019 or 2020 tax returns. Eligible parents will receive $3,600 for each child under 6 and $3,000 for each child under 18, with at least half being paid over the summer. The child tax credit has been made fully refundable, potentially making 20 million more children eligible.

The IRS has been working to ensure that those who are eligible receive their payments as quickly and efficiently as possible. The agency has implemented a variety of measures to prevent fraud and ensure the accuracy of payments.

The stimulus payments are part of a broader effort by the government to provide relief to those who have been affected by the pandemic. The payments are intended to help individuals and families cover essential expenses, such as rent, utilities, and food.

The distribution of the stimulus payments has been a complex process, with the IRS working to identify those who are eligible and issue payments as quickly as possible. The agency has faced a number of challenges, including the need to process a large volume of payments and the importance of ensuring that payments are accurate and go to the right people.

Despite these challenges, the IRS has made significant progress in distributing the stimulus payments. The agency has issued millions of payments, and millions more are expected to be issued in the coming weeks and months.

The stimulus payments have been welcomed by individuals and families who have been struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic. The payments have provided a much-needed lifeline for many, helping them to cover essential expenses and provide for their loved ones.

The government has also taken steps to ensure that the stimulus payments are targeted towards those who need them most. The payments are designed to phase out at higher income levels, meaning that those who are most in need will receive the full amount.

Overall, the distribution of the stimulus payments has been a significant undertaking, with the IRS working tirelessly to ensure that those who are eligible receive their payments as quickly and efficiently as possible. The payments have provided a vital lifeline for millions of Americans, helping them to weather the economic storm caused by the pandemic.
