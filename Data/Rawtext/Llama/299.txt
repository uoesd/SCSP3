Tennessee Expands COVID-19 Vaccination Eligibility to All Adults by April 5

NASHVILLE – Tennessee Governor Bill Lee announced today that all Tennessee adults will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccination by April 5, ahead of the federal goal of May 1. This expansion includes Tennesseans aged 55 and older, as well as those in Phase 2 of the vaccination plan, who are eligible as of March 18.

"We are proud to announce that we are expanding vaccine eligibility to all Tennesseans age 16 and over by April 5," said Governor Lee. "This is a significant step forward in our efforts to protect our citizens from COVID-19 and get our state back to normal as quickly as possible."

Tennessee Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey, MD, MBA, FAAP, highlighted the expansion's acceleration, saying, "We are ahead of the federal goal of May 1 for adult eligibility, and we are proud to be leading the way in vaccine distribution and administration."

Phase 3 of the vaccination plan includes congregate living staff and residents, and grocery store workers not previously eligible. Direct allocations of vaccines will be made to facilities housing those eligible in Phase 3.

Tennessee has received 2.9 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to date, and the state expects around 311,000 vaccine doses the week of March 22. Increased supplies of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine are expected the week of March 29.

Phase 2 includes essential workers in several key industries not covered in earlier phases, such as law enforcement, firefighters, and public transportation workers.

"We are committed to protecting our most vulnerable populations and those who are at highest risk of exposure," said Commissioner Piercey. "This expansion is a critical step in our efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep Tennesseans safe."

Eligible Tennesseans can schedule appointments for vaccination through the Tennessee Department of Health's online registration system or by contacting their healthcare provider.

"We urge all eligible Tennesseans to take advantage of this opportunity to protect themselves and their communities," said Governor Lee. "We are grateful for the tireless efforts of our healthcare workers, first responders, and essential workers who have been on the front lines of this pandemic. This expansion is a testament to their hard work and dedication."
