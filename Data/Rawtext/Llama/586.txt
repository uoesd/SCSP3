Security Council Demands Taliban Ensure Safe Passage out of Afghanistan, Condemns Deadly Kabul Attack

The United Nations Security Council has demanded that the Taliban ensure safe passage out of Afghanistan and prevent the country from being used as a shelter for terrorism, in response to the deadly attack at Kabul airport by the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP).

In a resolution mainly pushed by the United States, United Kingdom, and France, the Security Council strongly condemned the attack, which killed over 150 people and injured more than 200 others. The resolution emphasized the importance of safe passage for Afghans and foreign nationals at any time, and called for all parties to facilitate humanitarian assistance with safe and unhindered access.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, "The United States will continue to work with our international partners to ensure the safety and security of those who remain in Afghanistan, and to hold the Taliban accountable for their commitments."

Deputy Permanent Representative of France Nathalie Estival-Broadhurst stressed the importance of protecting human rights and the gains made over the past two decades. "The international community must remain vigilant in protecting the rights of all Afghans, particularly women, children, and minorities," she said.

UK Ambassador Barbara Woodward echoed these sentiments, stating, "The United Kingdom will continue to work with our international partners to ensure that the gains made in Afghanistan over the past two decades are not lost, and that the rights of all Afghans are protected."

Russia abstained from voting on the resolution, citing its failure to address concerns about combating international terrorism. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia stated, "We cannot support a resolution that does not fully take into account the concerns of all members of the international community regarding the threat of terrorism."

China emphasized the chaos in Afghanistan is tied to the disorderly withdrawal of foreign troops and called for reflection. Ambassador Geng Shuang said, "The current situation in Afghanistan is a reminder that the withdrawal of foreign troops must be done in an orderly and responsible manner."

The resolution seeks to hold the Taliban accountable to their commitments as judged by their actions. The US has evacuated over 122,000 people from Afghanistan since July, and continues to work with international partners to ensure the safety and security of those who remain in the country.

In conclusion, the Security Council's resolution highlights the international community's commitment to ensuring safe passage out of Afghanistan and preventing the country from being used as a shelter for terrorism. The resolution also emphasizes the importance of protecting human rights and the gains made over the past two decades, and seeks to hold the Taliban accountable to their commitments.
