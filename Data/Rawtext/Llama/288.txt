WHO Updates Guidance on COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Doses

Geneva, Switzerland - The World Health Organization (WHO), supported by its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), has reviewed the latest evidence on booster doses for COVID-19 vaccines. The current statement reflects the understanding as of December 7th, 2021, particularly in the context of the Omicron variant.

Booster doses are intended to restore vaccine effectiveness after it has diminished over time. The WHO Director-General has called for a moratorium on booster doses for healthy adults until the end of 2021 to improve global vaccine equity. Vaccine booster decisions should consider individual and public health benefits and global vaccine access equity.

The primary global health goal is to reduce COVID-19 deaths and severe disease, protect health systems, and ensure that all countries have access to vaccines. Emerging data show a decline in vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 over time, more so in older adults. Vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 decreased by about 8% over a period of 6 months in all age groups.

The WHO recommends an additional dose for certain inactivated vaccines for those aged 60 and over as part of the primary series. Booster vaccinations show a strong immunological response, with studies indicating improved protection against infection and severe disease.

The Omicron variant has further highlighted the importance of vaccine equity, as it has spread rapidly across the globe, infecting millions of people in a short period. The WHO is working tirelessly to ensure that all countries have access to vaccines and that the most vulnerable populations are protected.

The WHO urges countries to prioritize vaccine distribution equitably, focusing on those most at risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. This includes older adults, people with underlying health conditions, and healthcare workers.

In conclusion, the WHO's updated guidance on COVID-19 vaccine booster doses aims to balance individual and public health benefits with global vaccine access equity. By prioritizing those most at risk and ensuring that all countries have access to vaccines, we can work towards reducing COVID-19 deaths and severe disease, protecting health systems, and ultimately ending the pandemic.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that is responsible for international public health. Its main objective is to promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable.

The WHO has 194 member states and has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. It was established in 1948 and is led by a Director-General, who is elected by the World Health Assembly, the agency's governing body.

The WHO's main functions include providing leadership and technical expertise to its member states, setting global health policies and standards, coordinating global responses to health crises, and supporting countries in strengthening their health systems.

The WHO's work is guided by its Constitution, which emphasizes the right to health for all people, and its six core functions:

  1. Providing leadership and technical expertise to its member states
  2. Setting global health policies and standards
  3. Coordinating global responses to health crises
  4. Supporting countries in strengthening their health systems
  5. Promoting health equity and the right to health for all people
  6. Monitoring and assessing health trends and determinants

The WHO works closely with other UN agencies, such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), to achieve its goals. It also collaborates with non-governmental organizations, academic institutions, and private sector entities to promote health and well-being for all people.
