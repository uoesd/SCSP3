"SNL" Returns with a Bang: Kate McKinnon Spoofs Dr. Fauci, Cuomos and Cruz Get Roasted

"Saturday Night Live" Season 47 premiered with a bang, featuring Kate McKinnon as Dr. Anthony Fauci, Pete Davidson and Andrew Dismukes as disgraced brothers Andrew and Chris Cuomo, and Aidy Bryant as U.S. Senator Ted Cruz. The show didn't shy away from tackling controversial topics, including the omicron variant, COVID-19 safety measures, and sexual harassment allegations.

In the cold open, McKinnon's Fauci addressed the audience, saying, "I'm Dr. Anthony Fauci, and I'm here to answer your questions about COVID-19. But before we start, I just want to say, 'Wow, that omicron variant is a real doozy, folks!'" (Kate McKinnon as Dr. Anthony Fauci)

The skit included several scenarios, such as losing a vaccine card and the safety of air travel during the pandemic. McKinnon's Fauci reassured viewers, "Don't worry, we've got the best scientists working on it. They're like the Avengers, but instead of Iron Man and Captain America, we've got Dr. Birx and Dr. Redfield." (Kate McKinnon as Dr. Anthony Fauci)

Pete Davidson and Andrew Dismukes played disgraced brothers Andrew and Chris Cuomo, respectively. Davidson's Andrew Cuomo joked, "I may have lost my job as Governor of New York, but at least I still have my good looks. And my brother Chris here, he's still got his job at CNN... for now."

Andrew Dismukes' Chris Cuomo added, "Yeah, and I may have been fired from CNN, but I've got my family. That's what's most important." (Andrew Dismukes as Chris Cuomo)

The skit humorously suggested the Cuomos lost their jobs due to COVID-19, and they emphasized family importance.

U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, played by Aidy Bryant, humorously mentioned preferring to spend holidays in Cancun alone, saying, "I just want to be clear, I'm not afraid of COVID. I'm just afraid of being seen in public with a mask on. It's not a good look for me." (Aidy Bryant as U.S. Senator Ted Cruz)

The episode also commented on Chris Cuomo's pulled book publication and accusations of sexual harassment.

Overall, "SNL" has taken a lighter and funnier approach due to the absence of a presidential election. The show's return was met with excitement from fans, who were eager to see how the cast would tackle current events.

In a recent interview, McKinnon discussed the challenges of portraying Dr. Fauci, saying, "It's a delicate balance. You want to make fun of him, but you also want to make sure you're not making fun of the situation. He's a real person, and he's doing important work." (Kate McKinnon)

"SNL" continues to be a cultural phenomenon, providing a platform for comedians to address controversial topics and bring laughter to audiences across the country.

The show's return episode was a promising start to the new season, suggesting that "SNL" will continue to provide a humorous take on current events.
