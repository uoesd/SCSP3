Thune Criticizes GOP 'Cancel Culture,' Defends Dissenting Voices

PIERRE, S.D. (AP) – Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, has criticized party leaders and activists for engaging in "cancel culture" by censuring GOP senators who found former President Donald Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection. Thune defended his fellow Republicans who sided with Democrats, calling it a "vote of conscience" and warning against shutting out dissenting voices in the party.

In an interview with the Associated Press, Thune discussed Republicans' priorities under President Joe Biden, the proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, and upcoming primary battles within the GOP. He criticized Trump's post-election actions as "inexcusable" and accused him of undermining the peaceful transfer of power. Despite his criticism of Trump, Thune voted to acquit him in the impeachment trial, siding with most Republican senators.

Thune suggested taking steps to assist GOP candidates who refrain from discussing conspiracies, praising Rep. Liz Cheney for her performance on most issues. He believes Republicans are well-positioned to retake the Senate, attributing this to perceived policy overreach by Democrats. Thune said Biden might govern more moderately without pressure from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.

The senator predicted Republicans would focus on economic policy, fiscal responsibility, strong borders, and a tough China foreign policy. Thune expressed reservation about Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus package, indicating some Republicans might support a lower amount.

Thune's comments come as the GOP grapples with its future following the Trump presidency. Some Republicans have sought to silence dissenting voices within the party, while others have called for a more inclusive and diverse GOP. Thune's defense of his fellow Republicans who voted to convict Trump highlights the tension within the party between those who remain loyal to the former president and those who are willing to criticize him.

Thune's stance also underscores the challenges faced by Republicans as they navigate a post-Trump political landscape. While some Republicans have embraced Trump's populist and nationalist agenda, others have sought to distance themselves from his controversial policies and divisive rhetoric. Thune's call for the party to tolerate dissenting voices suggests that he believes the GOP can maintain its conservative principles while still being open to diverse perspectives.

Thune's criticism of Trump's post-election actions is notable, given that he voted to acquit the former president in the impeachment trial. Thune's decision to acquit Trump was met with criticism from some Democrats, who argued that Trump's actions were impeachable and that senators had a duty to hold him accountable. Thune's explanation for his vote, that it was a "vote of conscience," highlights the complexity of the impeachment process and the difficult choices faced by lawmakers.

Thune's praise for Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, suggests that he believes the party can maintain its conservative principles while still being open to diverse perspectives. Cheney has been a vocal critic of Trump's conspiracy theories and has called for the party to move beyond his divisive rhetoric. Thune's endorsement of Cheney's performance on most issues indicates that he believes the party can support candidates who are both conservative and willing to speak out against conspiracy theories and divisive rhetoric.

Thune's prediction that Republicans are well-positioned to retake the Senate is based on his belief that Democrats have overreached on policy issues. Thune argues that Democrats have moved too far to the left on issues such as healthcare and the environment, and that this will give Republicans an opportunity to regain control of the Senate. Thune's assessment is shared by many Republicans, who believe that the party can capitalize on public discontent with Democratic policies to win back seats in Congress.

Thune's call for the party to focus on economic policy, fiscal responsibility, strong borders, and a tough China foreign policy suggests that he believes the GOP can maintain its conservative principles while still being relevant to a changing political landscape. Thune's reservation about Biden's coronavirus package indicates that he believes the party can support policies that are fiscally responsible while still addressing pressing national issues.
