Prince Harry Attends Grandfather's Funeral, Speculation Swirls Around Baby Girl's Name

Prince Harry made a somber journey to London over the weekend to attend the funeral of his grandfather, Prince Philip. The Duke of Sussex traveled from California, where he resides with his pregnant wife, Meghan Markle, and their young son, Archie.

Meghan Markle, who is heavily pregnant with the couple's second child, stayed behind in the United States. The couple recently announced that they are expecting a baby girl, due in June or July, on Valentine's Day.

With the upcoming arrival of their daughter, speculation has been rife about the name the couple might choose. Royal fans and bettors alike have been pondering the significance of potential names for Meghan and Harry's daughter.

One name that has been gaining traction is 'Lily'. This sweet moniker is being discussed as a nod to the Queen's nickname 'Lilibet', which was given to her by her parents and husband. Some believe that Harry and Meghan might consider using this name or adapting it in some way to pay tribute to both royal grandparents.

Betting odds on the baby's name from Paddy Power include options like Diana, Allegra, and Maya among others. However, 'Lily' remains a popular choice, with many speculating that it could be a fitting tribute to the Queen and Prince Philip.

The Queen was known to be close to her husband, Prince Philip, and his passing has been a difficult time for the royal family. Prince Harry's attendance at the funeral was seen as a sign of respect and solidarity with his family during this period.

The couple's decision to name their daughter after the Queen and Prince Philip would not come as a surprise, given their history of paying tribute to their family members through their children's names. Their son, Archie, was named after Harry's late mother, Princess Diana, and Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland.

Royal fans have taken to social media to share their thoughts on the potential name choice. Some have pointed out that 'Lily' is a beautiful and classic name that would be fitting for a royal baby. Others have suggested that the couple might consider other names that pay tribute to their family heritage, such as 'Elizabeth' or 'Philipa'.

While the couple has not yet confirmed the name of their daughter, it is clear that they will choose a name that holds significant meaning and importance to their family. The wait continues, as royal fans eagerly anticipate the arrival of the newest member of the Sussex family.

In the meantime, Prince Harry's attendance at Prince Philip's funeral serves as a reminder of the strong bond between the royal family and their loved ones. The couple's decision to name their daughter after the Queen and Prince Philip would be a fitting tribute to their legacy and a testament to the enduring love and respect they have for their family.
