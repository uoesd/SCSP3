Building a Resilient Corporate Culture: The Key to Employee Engagement and Technology Adoption

In today's fast-paced and ever-changing business landscape, organizations are recognizing the importance of culture in driving employee engagement and technology adoption. According to Jasjit Singh Kang, Vice President, Global HRO, BPaaS and Business Financial Services, iCORE, Wipro Limited, "Culture is the backbone of any organization, and it plays a vital role in employee engagement, technology adoption, and ultimately, business success."

With over 28 years of experience in the industry, Kang has seen firsthand the impact that a strong culture can have on an organization. He believes that a two-pronged approach is necessary to create a resilient corporate culture that is adaptable to future workforces. "The first step is to promote psychological safety, where employees feel comfortable sharing their ideas and opinions without fear of retribution," he explains. "The second step is to prioritize employee experience with technology, ensuring that employees have the tools they need to be productive and efficient."

Technology is a vital enabler in enhancing employee experience and overcoming resistance to change. Emerging technologies like cognitive automation, RPA, and AI are instrumental in making HR functions more agile and collaborative. Kang notes, "These technologies enable HR to streamline processes, reduce errors, and provide employees with a more personalized experience."

In addition to enhancing employee experience, technology also plays a critical role in addressing the challenges of a diverse workforce and ensuring regulatory compliance. Kang emphasizes, "With a global workforce, it's essential to have a unified HR experience that ensures employees feel connected, regardless of their location." Global platforms providing a unified HR experience are becoming a trend, and Kang believes that this is a step in the right direction.

Establishing best practices for virtual onboarding is also critical for new employees to adapt to the corporate culture. Kang stresses, "Onboarding is a crucial time for new employees, and it's essential to provide them with a seamless transition into the organization's culture." An effective communication strategy is crucial in ensuring a smooth transition, and Kang advises organizations to leverage technology to provide new hires with a comprehensive onboarding experience.

In conclusion, building a resilient corporate culture is essential for employee engagement, technology adoption, and business success. By promoting psychological safety, prioritizing employee experience with technology, and leveraging emerging technologies, organizations can create a culture that is adaptable to future workforces. As Kang aptly puts it, "Culture is not a one-time event, it's a continuous process that requires constant nurturing and attention." By following these principles, organizations can foster a culture that drives employee engagement, technology adoption, and ultimately, business success.
