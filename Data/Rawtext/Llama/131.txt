Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon to Co-Host CNN Podcast 'The Handoff'

In a move to expand its digital revenue streams, CNN has announced the launch of a new podcast titled The Handoff, co-hosted by primetime anchors Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon. The weekly podcast will be available exclusively to subscribers of the CNN channel on Apple Podcasts.

The Handoff is inspired by the spontaneous 'handoff' conversations between Cuomo's and Lemon's respective shows, which have previously made headlines for their on-air banter, including a discussion about Rick Santorum's offensive remarks. The podcast aims to offer unscripted, honest conversations that are not for the easily offended, according to Lemon.

"We're not going to sugarcoat anything," Lemon said in a statement. "We're going to have real thoughts, questions, and disagreements that are often glossed over in media. We want to toughen up our audience with straightforward dialogue."

Cuomo echoed Lemon's sentiments, highlighting the authenticity of their discussions as a prime reason for the podcast. "People are curious about our conversations, and we want to give them a front-row seat to our unfiltered discussions," Cuomo said.

The Handoff is part of a new wave of podcasts launched by CNN, which includes Behind the Desk: The Story of Late Night and a podcast by Dr. Sanjay Gupta. The network aims to expand its digital revenue streams through these new offerings.

Lemon emphasized that The Handoff is not just another news podcast. "We're not going to bore you with the same news you've heard all day," he said. "We're going to give you something different, something that will make you think and maybe even make you uncomfortable."

Cuomo added, "We're not afraid to tackle tough topics, and we're not going to shy away from controversy. We want to challenge our listeners and make them think critically about the world around them."

The Handoff is set to premiere on March 22, with new episodes released every Thursday. Fans of Cuomo and Lemon's on-air banter are eagerly anticipating the launch, taking to social media to express their excitement.

In a tweet, Lemon wrote, "Get ready for some real talk! @ChrisCuomo and I are excited to announce our new podcast, The Handoff. Subscribe now and join the conversation!"

Cuomo also shared his enthusiasm, tweeting, "The Handoff is going to be a wild ride. Can't wait to share our unfiltered thoughts with you all. Subscribe now and get ready for some real talk!"

With The Handoff, CNN is capitalizing on the growing popularity of podcasts, which have become an increasingly important revenue stream for media companies. The network is betting that the authenticity and chemistry between Cuomo and Lemon will resonate with listeners and attract a large following.

In conclusion, The Handoff promises to be a refreshing addition to the podcast landscape, offering listeners unscripted, honest conversations that are not typically found in traditional news programming. With its focus on real thoughts, questions, and disagreements, The Handoff is sure to captivate audiences and provide a unique listening experience.
