CNN – The Department of Defense has released the names of the 13 US service members killed in an attack at Kabul's airport in Afghanistan. The attack, which took place on August 26, was carried out by a suicide bomber and left dozens of people dead and injured.

US Rep. Tim Burchett, who represents Tennessee's 2nd congressional district, paid tribute to Knauss, saying, "Ryan was a hero, and his sacrifice will never be forgotten." Knauss was the only Army member killed in the attack.

Rylee McCollum, who was just 20 years old, was on his first deployment and was expecting to become a father in three weeks. His family remembered him as a kind and caring person who loved his country and was proud to serve.

Daegan Page's family also paid tribute to their loved one, remembering him for his compassionate nature and plans for the future beyond his military service. "Daegan was a loving son, brother, and friend who always put others before himself," his family said in a statement.

Maxton Soviak, a US Navy corpsman attached to the Marines, was celebrated for his pride in serving his country. His family remembered him as a selfless and dedicated individual who loved his job and was passionate about helping others.

Hunter Lopez, who was just 22 years old, planned to follow in his parents' footsteps and join law enforcement after his military service. His family remembered him as a kind and caring person who always put others first.

Jared M. Schmitz, who was also just 22 years old, was remembered by his father for his dedication to the Marine Corps and special bond with his sister. "Jared was an amazing young man who loved his country and was proud to serve," his father said.

GoFundMe pages and public tributes have been set up for the families of the deceased service members. The attack was widely condemned by politicians and military leaders, who praised the bravery and sacrifice of the service members who lost their lives.

The attack on Kabul's airport was carried out by a suicide bomber who detonated an explosive device near the airport's Abbey Gate. The attack also left dozens of people injured, including US service members and civilians.

The attack came as the US and its allies continue to evacuate people from Afghanistan following the Taliban's takeover of the country. The US has vowed to continue its mission to evacuate those who are eligible, despite the attack.
