FDA Expands Use of Booster Doses for COVID-19 Vaccines in Eligible Populations

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today announced the expansion of the use of booster doses for COVID-19 vaccines in eligible populations. The agency has authorized the use of booster doses for Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) for people aged 65 and older, as well as for individuals aged 18-64 who are at high risk or have frequent exposure to SARS-CoV-2, six months after the primary series.

"As we continue to monitor the spread of COVID-19, it's important that we take steps to protect those who are at highest risk for severe illness," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. "The authorization of booster doses for these populations will help to ensure that they have the best possible protection against COVID-19."

In addition, the FDA has authorized the use of a booster dose for Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S) for individuals aged 18 and older, two months after the initial dose. The agency has also clarified that Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) can be used as a booster dose for individuals aged 18-64 who have frequent exposure to SARS-CoV-2, six months after the primary series.

"The data from clinical trials have shown that booster doses of these vaccines are safe and effective in eliciting an immune response," said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "We are confident that these booster doses will help to protect those who are at highest risk for severe illness from COVID-19."

The FDA has also approved a "mix and match" approach for booster doses, allowing individuals to receive a different vaccine for their booster dose than they received for their primary vaccination. This approach is supported by safety and immune response data from clinical trials, and aligns with the eligibility and dosing interval for booster doses used in primary vaccination.

The agency has also identified increased risks of myocarditis, pericarditis, and other conditions linked to COVID-19 vaccines. However, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have affirmed the overall safety of the vaccines and encourage health care providers to follow CDC recommendations on booster administrations.

Side effects for booster doses are similar to those experienced after the primary doses, and include pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site, as well as fatigue, headache, and muscle or joint pain.

The FDA and CDC will continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including booster doses, and will provide updates as necessary. Health care providers are encouraged to report any adverse events following vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

"We are committed to ensuring the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, and will continue to monitor their use in real-world settings," said Dr. Woodcock. "We encourage health care providers to follow CDC recommendations on booster administrations and to report any adverse events to VAERS."

The authorization of booster doses for COVID-19 vaccines is an important step in protecting those who are at highest risk for severe illness from COVID-19. The FDA will continue to work closely with the CDC and other partners to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and to take steps to protect the public's health.
