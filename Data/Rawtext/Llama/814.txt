California's Golden State Stimulus II: Nearly 9 Million Residents to Receive $600 Payments Starting Oct. 5

California residents, get ready for some financial relief! Starting October 5, nearly 9 million eligible residents are set to receive a third batch of Golden State Stimulus II payments, totaling $600 per person. This is part of California's $100 billion California Comeback Plan, aimed at helping residents recover from the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Under Golden State Stimulus II, eligibility for the $600 payments has expanded compared to the initial round of payments. Qualifying families with dependents could receive an additional $500, bringing their total potential relief to $1,100.

To be eligible for these payments, residents must have been a California resident for more than half of the 2020 tax year and have filed their 2020 taxes by October 15, 2021. Income limits for eligibility are set at $75,000 or less for the 2020 tax year, and recipients cannot be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer.

Direct deposit payments are expected before October 31, while paper checks will be distributed between October 6 and January of the following year. Stimulus payments will be sent out approximately every two weeks.

Paper check delivery is organized by the last three digits of recipients' ZIP codes as listed on their 2020 tax return. For example, residents with a ZIP code ending in 001-100 will receive their payment on October 6, while those with a ZIP code ending in 101-200 will receive their payment on October 13.

It's important to note that state stimulus payments are protected from being seized for debts like child support or owed to state agencies. This means that eligible residents can receive their payments without worrying about them being garnished.

The California Comeback Plan was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom in July 2021, with the goal of helping residents and businesses recover from the pandemic. The plan includes a variety of measures, including the Golden State Stimulus II payments, aimed at providing financial relief to those who need it most.

In addition to the stimulus payments, the California Comeback Plan includes funding for small businesses, education, and healthcare. The plan also includes measures to support low-income families and individuals, such as increased funding for food assistance programs and housing support.

The Golden State Stimulus II payments are just one part of California's efforts to support its residents during this challenging time. By providing financial relief to those who need it most, California is working to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to recover and thrive.

So, if you're a California resident who meets the eligibility requirements, keep an eye on your bank account or mailbox starting October 5. Your $600 payment could be on its way!
