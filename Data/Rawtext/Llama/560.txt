Taliban Consolidate Power in Afghanistan, Promise Reforms Amid Chaos

Sept 15 (Reuters) – The Taliban's lightning-fast offensive across Afghanistan culminated in the capture of Kabul on Aug. 15, plunging the country into chaos as foreigners and Afghans scrambled to leave. Amid global criticism, U.S. President Joe Biden addressed the fallout of the U.S. military withdrawal on Aug. 17.

Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid attempted to reassure the public, promising respect for women's rights and no reprisals in a press conference. However, anti-Taliban protests and violent incidents, including a suicide bomb attack, erupted throughout the month.

In response to reports of atrocities and economic turmoil, the Taliban announced measures to address the issues. The U.S. military conducted drone strikes against Islamic State threats near Kabul airport, while U.S. Central Command announced the completion of U.S. troop withdrawal on Aug. 30.

The Taliban unveiled a new government on Sept. 7, and Kabul airport reopened for aid and domestic flights. International donors pledged $1.1 billion for Afghanistan, aiming to alleviate the humanitarian crisis.

U.S. General Frank McKenzie, Head of U.S. Central Command, acknowledged the challenges ahead, stating, "The road ahead will be long and difficult, but we are committed to supporting the Afghan people."

Zabihullah Mujahid, Taliban spokesperson, expressed a desire for peaceful relations with the international community, saying, "We want to have good relations with the world, and we will work for it."

Despite these efforts, concerns persist regarding the Taliban's human rights record and the potential for reprisals against those who worked with foreign forces. The United Nations Human Rights Council condemned reports of summary executions, torture, and other abuses.

Amid the power vacuum, various factions within the Taliban jockeyed for influence, leading to scattered violence. The Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) posed a continued threat, with the Taliban claiming to have arrested several ISIS-K militants.

As the dust settles on the Taliban's takeover, the future of Afghanistan remains uncertain. The international community watches cautiously, hoping for a peaceful transition and the protection of human rights.

In a sign of tentative progress, the Taliban announced the reopening of schools and universities, with women allowed to attend. However, many Afghans remain wary, fearing a return to the harsh rule of the Taliban's previous regime in the 1990s.

The United States and its allies continue to monitor the situation, weighing their options for engagement with the new government. The European Union pledged support for Afghanistan, while calling on the Taliban to uphold human rights and the rule of law.

As the Taliban consolidate their power, the world watches with a mix of trepidation and hope. Will the new government bring stability and peace to Afghanistan, or will the country succumb to further chaos and violence? Only time will tell.
