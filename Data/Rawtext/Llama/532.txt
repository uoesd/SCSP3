Tragedy in Kabul: 13 US Service Members Killed in Terrorist Attack

In a devastating blow to the US military, 13 service members were killed and at least 18 others wounded in a terrorist attack at Kabul airport in Afghanistan on Thursday. The attack, claimed by the Islamic State, marks the first US military combat deaths in Afghanistan since February 2020.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby confirmed the casualties, stating, "We can confirm that a number of US service members were killed and injured in today's attack at Kabul airport." CENTCOM spokesman Capt. Bill Urban also confirmed the casualties, adding that the injured service members were receiving medical treatment.

According to Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, head of US Central Command, the attack was carried out by the Islamic State (ISIS-K). In a statement, McKenzie expressed his deepest condolences to the families of the fallen service members and emphasized the ongoing threat posed by ISIS-K to US and allied forces, as well as to civilians.

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also issued a statement, expressing his deep condolences to the families of the fallen service members. Austin emphasized the importance of the mission in Afghanistan and pledged support for the families of those who were killed.

"Their sacrifice will not be in vain, and we will continue to support the Afghan people in their fight against terrorism," Austin said.

President Joe Biden also addressed the attack, highlighting the ongoing threat from ISIS-K and reiterating the US's commitment to supporting the Afghan people.

"We will not be deterred by these heinous acts, and we will continue to support the Afghan people in their fight against terrorism," Biden said.

The attack, which took place near the Abbey Gate of Kabul airport, also left at least 95 Afghans dead and an additional 120 to 140 injured. The attack was carried out by a suicide bomber who detonated an explosive device near a crowd of people waiting to be evacuated from Afghanistan.

The attack has sparked criticism of the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, with some arguing that the US should have anticipated the threat from ISIS-K and taken greater precautions to protect service members and civilians.

In response to the criticism, Austin emphasized the importance of the mission in Afghanistan and pledged to continue supporting the Afghan people in their fight against terrorism.

"We will not be deterred by these heinous acts, and we will continue to support the Afghan people in their fight against terrorism," Austin said.

The attack is a grim reminder of the ongoing threat posed by terrorist groups in Afghanistan and the risks faced by US service members and civilians in the region. As the US continues its withdrawal from Afghanistan, it remains committed to supporting the Afghan people in their fight against terrorism and ensuring the safety and security of the region.

In conclusion, the terrorist attack at Kabul airport is a tragic reminder of the risks faced by US service members and civilians in Afghanistan. Our thoughts and condolences go out to the families of the fallen service members, and we will continue to support the Afghan people in their fight against terrorism.
