Capitol Riot Defendant Blames 'Foxitis' for His Actions, Expresses Regret

Washington – Anthony Antonio, a defendant in the Capitol riot case, has blamed his actions on "Foxitis," a term introduced by his lawyer, Joseph Hurley, to describe the influence of Fox News and former President Donald Trump's false claims on his client's beliefs.

In an interview with CNN, Antonio expressed regret for his participation in the January 6 insurrection and acknowledged that he was misled by false information. "I felt like America was being robbed of a president," he said, referring to the false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.

Antonio admitted to participating in the riot, influenced by the misinformation he consumed from Fox News and Trump. He shouted at police, poured water on an officer, and entered the Capitol building. "I realize now that I was deceived," he said.

His lawyer, Joseph Hurley, introduced the term "Foxitis" to describe Antonio's condition after losing his job and consuming Fox News content. "Foxitis is a condition where a person's beliefs and actions are influenced by the consumption of Fox News and other right-wing media," Hurley explained.

Many Capitol riot defendants have unsuccessfully blamed Trump for their actions, and judges are concerned about the role of right-wing media in the insurrection. Antonio, however, acknowledges that he was mistaken in not aiding DC Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who was injured during the riot.

Court documents reveal Antonio's actions during the riot, including shouting at police, pouring water on an officer, and entering the Capitol. The Justice Department has charged hundreds from 43 states and Washington, DC, in the massive federal inquiry into the insurrection. Federal prosecutors expect to charge at least 500 people in relation to the January 6 insurrection.

Antonio realized he had been misled a few days after the insurrection but takes full responsibility for his actions. "I'm not blaming anyone else," he said. "I made a mistake, and I'm willing to face the consequences."

Antonio's case is one of many that highlight the dangers of misinformation and the role of right-wing media in shaping beliefs and actions. His lawyer, Joseph Hurley, hopes that the term "Foxitis" will raise awareness about the impact of media consumption on individuals and society.

In conclusion, the case of Anthony Antonio serves as a reminder of the importance of fact-checking and media literacy in today's society. The spread of misinformation can have dangerous consequences, as seen in the Capitol riot. It is crucial for individuals to be aware of the potential impact of media consumption on their beliefs and actions.
