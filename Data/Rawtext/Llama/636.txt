Wisconsin Judge Dismisses Gun Charge Against Kyle Rittenhouse

MADISON, Wis. (AP) – A Wisconsin judge has dismissed a gun possession charge against Kyle Rittenhouse, who was accused of killing two men during a protest in Kenosha. Judge Bruce Schroeder ruled that Rittenhouse's AR-15-style rifle did not meet the definition of a short-barreled weapon, which is illegal for minors to possess in Wisconsin.

Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shootings, faced five felony charges, including murder, but was found not guilty. The gun possession charge, a misdemeanor, was seen as a potential compromise for jurors who believed in Rittenhouse's self-defense claim but also criticized his decision to carry a rifle.

Defense attorneys pointed to a legal exception that allows minors to possess shotguns and rifles if they're not short-barreled, leading to the charge's dismissal. "We're grateful that the court recognized that Kyle Rittenhouse was within his legal rights to possess the firearm that he did," said Mark Richards, one of Rittenhouse's attorneys.

Assistant District Attorney James Kraus argued that the exception for long guns did not apply in Rittenhouse's case because he was carrying the rifle in a public space, rather than for hunting purposes. However, Judge Schroeder sided with the defense, stating that the law did not explicitly prohibit minors from carrying long guns in public.

Wisconsin law on minors possessing firearms has evolved, with legislative changes that have expanded and refined prohibitions and exceptions. The exception that allowed minors to possess long guns for hunting purposes may have been influenced by efforts to create lifetime gun owners.

Critics argue that the law's ambiguity concerning long guns for minors is problematic and did not foresee its application in protest situations like in Kenosha. "The law is confusing, and it's not surprising that people are confused about it," said Jeri Bonavia, executive director of the Wisconsin Anti-Violence Effort.

Legal experts suggest that the law's complexity and ambiguity necessitate its interpretation in favor of defendants, to prevent potential abuse by the government. "The law has to be written in a way that's clear and unambiguous, so people know what's legal and what's not," said Tom Grieve, a Milwaukee attorney and former prosecutor.

There's debate over the intention behind the exception for long guns, with some suggesting it was meant for hunting, not for carrying in public spaces like protests. "The spirit of the law was to allow kids to hunt with their parents, not to allow them to carry around assault rifles in public," said Democrat Jon Erpenbach, a state Senate member.

Michael Cicchini, a defense attorney not involved in the case, noted that the law's ambiguity may have been intentional, to allow for flexibility in its application. "Sometimes the law is written in a way that's intentionally vague, so that it can be interpreted in different ways depending on the situation," he said.

Corey Chirafisi, another of Rittenhouse's attorneys, argued that the exception for long guns should be interpreted broadly, to protect the rights of law-abiding citizens. "We believe that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms, and that includes the right to carry a long gun for self-defense," he said.

The dismissal of the gun possession charge against Rittenhouse highlights the complexities and nuances of Wisconsin's gun laws, and the ongoing debate over the role of firearms in society. As the state continues to grapple with issues of gun violence and public safety, it remains to be seen how the law will evolve to address these concerns.
