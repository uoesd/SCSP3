Taliban Takeover: Washington Post Staff Narrowly Escape Kabul on Chartered Plane

KABUL – Two days after the Taliban took control of Kabul, a group of Washington Post staff members were offered a chance to escape the city on a chartered plane bound for Qatar. The journey was fraught with danger, as security around the airport was rapidly deteriorating.

"The situation was getting worse by the hour," said Aziz Tassal, a Washington Post reporter who was part of the group. "We knew we had to leave, but the journey to the airport was the most challenging part."

The group faced dangerous conditions and Taliban checkpoints along the way. Tassal and his daughter had previously been beaten by Taliban fighters while trying to flee, and the threat of violence was ever-present.

Despite the risks, the Biden administration was escalating evacuation plans, but could not guarantee safe passage to the airport. The group was forced to rely on rented armored cars for safety, and they encountered desperate families and damaged vehicles along the way.

As they approached the airport, they encountered a Taliban checkpoint. But with the help of British troops, they were able to bypass the checkpoint and reach the military base.

Upon arriving at the base, there were initial fears that no charter planes would land that day. But an American military officer arranged for the group to leave on a U.S. military flight to Qatar.

The flight was packed with mostly Afghans, with seats removed to accommodate more people. Tassal described the scene as "chaotic and emotional," as many of the passengers were fleeing their homeland for the first time.

The journey was not without its challenges, but the group was relieved to have made it out of Kabul safely. "We were lucky to get out," Tassal said. "But there are many others who are still trapped in the city, and their fate is uncertain."

The Taliban takeover of Kabul has sparked a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of people attempting to flee the city. The Washington Post staff members' narrow escape serves as a reminder of the dangers faced by those who remain in the city, and the urgent need for international assistance.
