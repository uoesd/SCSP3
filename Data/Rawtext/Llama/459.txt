Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: A Financial Breakdown of Their New Life in California

Since Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision to step down as senior royals in early 2020, the couple has been making headlines for their new life in California. From their luxurious estate in Montecito to their lucrative contracts in the entertainment industry, here's a breakdown of their financial situation.

Before leaving the UK, 95% of the couple's expenses were covered by the Duchy of Cornwall, while the remaining 5% was covered by the Sovereign Grant. However, with their new status as non-working members of the royal family, they are now responsible for their own finances.

The couple purchased a stunning $14.7 million estate in Montecito, California, which is rumored to have an annual security cost of $3 million. The estate boasts 14 bathrooms, 10 bedrooms, a private movie theater, a tennis court, and a swimming pool.

Prince Harry's initial financial independence was supported by a $13 million trust from Princess Diana, which he inherited after her death in 1997. Meghan Markle, on the other hand, contributed $2 million from her acting career.

The couple's current net worth is growing thanks to their lucrative contracts in the entertainment industry. In September 2020, they signed a $100 million contract with Netflix for various productions, including documentaries, docu-series, and feature films. Their first Netflix project, 'Heart of Invictus,' focuses on competitors preparing for the Invictus Games.

In addition to their Netflix deal, the couple also announced a partnership with Spotify to produce podcasts, potentially worth $35 million. Meghan's book, 'The Bench,' became a New York Times bestseller in the children's picture book category, with speculation suggesting she could have received a $700,000 advance for the book.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's financial future looks bright, with their net worth expected to continue growing as they continue to secure lucrative deals in the entertainment industry. Their decision to step down as senior royals has given them the freedom to pursue their passions and build a life outside of the royal family.

While their new life in California comes with a hefty price tag, the couple seems to be thriving in their new roles. With their financial security and growing net worth, they are well on their way to becoming two of the most successful and influential celebrities in Hollywood.

In conclusion, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's financial breakdown is a testament to their ability to adapt and thrive in their new life outside of the royal family. With their lucrative contracts and growing net worth, they are set to become two of the most successful celebrities in Hollywood.
