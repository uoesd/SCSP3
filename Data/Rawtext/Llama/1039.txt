Vistra Corp Raises Winter Storm Uri Cost Estimate to $1.6 Billion

April 26 – Vistra Corp, a leading energy company, has increased its estimated cost for the February winter storm Uri to approximately $1.6 billion, up from its previous estimate of $900 million to $1.3 billion. The new estimate excludes potential recoveries from legal and regulatory challenges.

In a statement, Curt Morgan, Chief Executive of Vistra, said, "We generated more power than our market share during the storm, but faced high costs due to unfulfilled gas contracts and had to buy power at high prices." He added, "Absent gas deliverability and cost issues, Uri would have had a slightly positive impact on 2021 EBITDA."

As a result of the storm, Vistra has revised its 2021 EBITDA and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow guidance. The revised EBITDA range is $1,475-$1,875 million, and the free cash flow range is $200-$600 million. Before the storm, Vistra had estimated significantly higher EBITDA and free cash flow for 2021.

Despite the increased costs, Vistra will not buy additional shares in 2021 but will maintain its quarterly dividend. In a statement, Morgan said, "We remain committed to our dividend and will continue to evaluate opportunities to return capital to shareholders."

The impact of the storm on Vistra's financial performance was significant, with the company facing high costs due to unfulfilled gas contracts and having to buy power at high prices. However, the company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, with Morgan stating, "We are confident in our ability to navigate the challenges posed by the storm and continue to deliver value to our shareholders."

In conclusion, Vistra Corp's increased cost estimate for winter storm Uri reflects the significant impact of the storm on the company's financial performance. Despite the challenges posed by the storm, the company remains committed to its dividend and will continue to evaluate opportunities to return capital to shareholders.
