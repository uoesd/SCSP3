Melania Trump Learned of Her Non-Attendance at Biden's Inauguration through Trump's Tweet

In a surprising turn of events, it has been revealed that Melania Trump learned of her non-attendance at President Joe Biden's inauguration through her husband's tweet. According to a senior White House staffer, Melania was uncertain if her husband would break tradition by not attending the inauguration until she saw his tweet on January 8.

The staffer, who wished to remain anonymous, shared that Melania often learns of her husband's actions through his tweets. "She's not always in the loop, especially when it comes to his Twitter activity," the staffer said.

Melania Trump has largely stayed quiet about the efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, but she has supported her husband's calls for "fair elections" after his loss. However, her silence has been met with criticism, particularly after the Capitol insurrection on January 6.

Five days after the riot, Melania released a statement expressing sympathy for the rioters and police officers who died. In the statement, she also accused critics of spreading "salacious gossip" and "false misleading accusations" against her.

Despite the backlash, Melania has been preparing for life post-Washington, D.C. She has been moving belongings to Mar-a-Lago, her husband's private club in Florida, and has arranged for her son, Barron, to attend school in the state.

The first lady's absence from the inauguration was a topic of much speculation, with many assuming that she would attend out of respect for the tradition and the office of the presidency. However, her decision not to attend aligns with her husband's repeated claims that the election was "stolen" from him.

President Trump's tweet on January 8 read, "Melania and I will not be attending the Inauguration on January 20th. We wish the new administration all the best." The tweet came as a surprise to many, including Melania herself, according to the senior White House staffer.

The Trumps' decision not to attend the inauguration is a break from tradition, as outgoing presidents and first ladies have historically attended the ceremony as a sign of respect for the peaceful transfer of power.

In conclusion, Melania Trump's non-attendance at President Biden's inauguration has sparked controversy and raised questions about the Trumps' commitment to upholding democratic traditions. While the first lady has remained largely silent on the matter, her husband's tweet and her statement expressing sympathy for the rioters and police officers who died have only added fuel to the fire. As the Trumps embark on their post-Washington, D.C. life, it remains to be seen how they will continue to navigate the political landscape.
