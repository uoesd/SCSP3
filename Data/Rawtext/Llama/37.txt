National Guard Deployed to Washington D.C. as Pre-Riot Intelligence Proves Inconsistent

WASHINGTON – In the aftermath of the Capitol riot, the Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, has acknowledged that pre-riot intelligence was inconsistent, with estimates of crowd size varying widely. This inconsistency made it difficult to determine the scale of the threat, according to McCarthy. In response to the violence and to ensure security for the upcoming presidential inauguration, 6,200 National Guard personnel will be deployed to Washington D.C. for a minimum of 30 days.

The deployment is aimed at supporting traffic control and law enforcement, and will ensure security for President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20. Former presidents and officials have condemned the violent events and the disruption of the electoral process on January 6. During the Capitol riot, approximately 1,100 National Guard troops were mobilized to assist local law enforcement. President Donald Trump, who has not conceded defeat, rallied supporters before the riot but has not condemned their actions. Biden's inauguration plans have been altered due to COVID-19, focusing on virtual participation to prevent the spread. President-elect Joe Biden condemned the riot, describing it as an assault on democracy and calling for an end to the violence.

"The intelligence was inconsistent, and it was difficult to determine the scale of the threat," McCarthy said. "We're taking this very seriously, and we're doing everything we can to ensure the safety and security of everyone involved."

The National Guard's presence will provide much-needed support for law enforcement and traffic control, and will help to ensure a peaceful and secure inauguration. The deployment is a necessary response to the violent events of January 6, and will help to restore order and stability to the nation's capital.
