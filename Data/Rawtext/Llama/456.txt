"Harry & Meghan: Escaping the Palace" Premieres, Offering a Dramatized Look into the Royal Couple's Journey

Lifetime's latest biopic, "Harry & Meghan: Escaping the Palace," premiered on Saturday, offering a dramatized account of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's journey leaving royal life. The movie combines tabloid stories with the couple's personal account, covering events from after the birth of their son Archie to their post-Oprah interview.

According to Joe Little, Managing Editor of Majesty magazine, the film takes creative liberties with real-life events, dramatizing moments and adding fictional elements to make for a compelling story. "The film is not a documentary, it's a drama, and they've taken some liberties with the story to make it more interesting," he said.

One such moment is the depiction of the couple's discomfort at Trooping the Colour 2019, a stark contrast to their actual situation according to royal protocol. In the film, Meghan is shown struggling with the strict rules and protocols of the royal family, a theme that is carried throughout the movie.

Meghan's mental health struggles and suicidal thoughts, shared in her Oprah interview, are also paralleled with Princess Diana's experiences in the film. The movie highlights the pressure and scrutiny that comes with being a member of the royal family, and the toll it can take on one's mental health.

The film also dramatizes the Sussexes' final royal appearance, suggesting tension and reconciliation among royals that has not been confirmed in real life. However, Little notes that the film's portrayal of the couple's relationship with the royal family is not entirely accurate. "The film makes it seem like the royal family was against Harry and Meghan from the start, but that's not entirely true," he said.

Despite the Oprah interview being a pivotal event in the couple's journey, it was surprisingly underrepresented in the film. Sydney Morton, the actor who portrayed Meghan in the movie, noted that the interview was a turning point for the couple, but it was not the focus of the film. "The interview was a big moment, but it was just one part of their journey," she said.

People magazine provides a reality check on these dramatized events, offering insights from sources close to the royals. The film touches on sensitive topics like mental health, royal family dynamics, and the couple's search for independence, making it a must-watch for fans of the royal family.

In the film, Meghan is quoted as saying, "I never thought it would be easy, but I thought it would be fair." This quote highlights the couple's desire for a more normal life, free from the scrutiny and pressure of the royal family.

Overall, "Harry & Meghan: Escaping the Palace" offers a dramatized look into the royal couple's journey, taking creative liberties to make for a compelling story. While not entirely accurate, the film sheds light on the pressures and struggles that come with being a member of the royal family, and the couple's desire for a more independent life.
