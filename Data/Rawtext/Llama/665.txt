Rittenhouse's Lawyers Refute White Supremacy Links as Prosecutors Seek Bond Modification

Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old accused of killing two people and injuring another during the Kenosha protests, has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. However, his legal team has faced a new challenge after prosecutors filed a motion to modify his bond, citing concerns over his association with white supremacist groups.

According to Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas C. Binge, Rittenhouse was seen at a local bar, interacting with adults who were singing a Proud Boys anthem and posing with the "OK" hand gesture, which has been co-opted by white supremacist groups. Binge's motion aims to restrict Rittenhouse from consuming alcohol, frequenting bars, and associating with white supremacist groups.

Defense attorney Mark Richards has denied Rittenhouse's link to any far-right groups and has stated that he does not oppose bond modification barring association with hate groups. However, Richards has criticized the motion as an attempt to insert race into a self-defense case.

"This is a self-defense case, and the district attorney is trying to make it about something else," Richards said. "They're trying to make it about race, and that's not what this case is about."

Wisconsin law allows individuals aged 18-20 to drink alcohol under parental supervision, and Rittenhouse's bar visit did not violate his bond conditions. Prosecutors have also accused Rittenhouse of joining right-wing militias during the Kenosha protest, but no evidence has been found of him following such groups on social media.

Rittenhouse's defense team has threatened legal action against those accusing him of white supremacy. "We will not stand idly by while Mr. Rittenhouse's reputation is dragged through the mud," Richards said. "We will take legal action against anyone who continues to make false accusations against him."

The motion to modify Rittenhouse's bond comes as his legal team prepares for a possible trial. Rittenhouse has been charged with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide, one count of attempted first-degree intentional homicide, and two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety. He faces life in prison if convicted.

The case has sparked national attention, with many focusing on Rittenhouse's alleged links to white supremacist groups. However, Richards has maintained that his client is not affiliated with any such groups and that the case should be focused on self-defense.

"This case is about self-defense, and that's what we're going to focus on," Richards said. "We're not going to let the district attorney turn this into a trial about race or politics."

The motion to modify Rittenhouse's bond is set to be heard on October 27. Until then, Rittenhouse remains free on a $2 million bond.

In a statement, Binge said, "We take any allegations of white supremacy very seriously, and we will do everything in our power to ensure that Mr. Rittenhouse is held accountable for his actions."

The Rittenhouse case has sparked a larger conversation about white supremacy and its role in the United States. Many have called for greater accountability for those associated with hate groups, while others have argued that such associations should not be used to unfairly malign individuals.

Regardless of the outcome of the bond modification hearing, the Rittenhouse case is set to continue garnering national attention as it moves forward.
