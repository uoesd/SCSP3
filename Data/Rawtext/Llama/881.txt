A source close to the couple exclusively revealed to Us Weekly that Herman has been by Woods' side non-stop, providing emotional support during this difficult time.

Woods suffered severe leg injuries in the single-car accident, including significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity. He underwent emergency surgery at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center before being transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for further treatment.

Dr. Anish Mahajan, Chief Medical Officer and Interim CEO at Harbor-UCLA, detailed the specifics of Woods' injuries in a statement. "Tiger Woods was brought to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center with severe injuries to his right lower extremity," Dr. Mahajan said. "He underwent emergency surgery for his injuries and was stabilized. He was then transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for further treatment and recovery."

"It means a lot to me and my family. I'm focused on my recovery and looking forward to getting back to golf when the time is right."

Woods has two children, Sam and Charlie, with his ex-wife Elin Nordegren, whom he divorced in 2010. His ex-girlfriend, Lindsey Vonn, also expressed her well-wishes following the accident. "Praying for Tiger Woods and hoping for a speedy recovery," Vonn tweeted.

Woods and Herman confirmed their relationship in November 2017, with Herman expressing optimism about the future of their relationship. "We're just taking it one day at a time and enjoying each other's company," Herman said in an interview with Golf Digest.

Herman's unwavering support for Woods during this difficult time is a testament to the strength of their relationship. A source close to the couple told Us Weekly that Herman has been a rock for Woods, providing emotional support and helping him through the recovery process.
