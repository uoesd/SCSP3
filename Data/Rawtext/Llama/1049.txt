Witness Describes Explosive Argument Between Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie at Wyoming Restaurant

NORTH PORT, Florida (WABC) – A witness has come forward describing an explosive argument between Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie at a restaurant in Jackson, Wyoming. The altercation reportedly took place on August 27 at the Merry Piglet restaurant, where Petito and Laundrie were dining.

According to Nina Celie Angelo, a witness who was present at the restaurant, Laundrie was screaming at the hostess and Petito was seen in tears, apologizing. Angelo described Laundrie as being very angry and temperamental towards the restaurant staff, with Petito appearing upset and embarrassed.

"I was sitting at the bar and I heard a commotion coming from the hostess stand," Angelo said in an interview with WABC-TV. "I turned around and saw Brian Laundrie screaming at the hostess. Gabby Petito was standing next to him, looking really upset and apologizing to the staff."

The Blue-Collar Restaurant Group, which owns the Merry Piglet, confirmed that Petito and Laundrie were present at their restaurant on August 27. In a statement, the restaurant said, "We can confirm that Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie were at our restaurant on August 27. We apologize for any inconvenience or discomfort they may have caused."

Angelo described Laundrie as entering and exiting the restaurant multiple times, continuing the altercation with staff members. Petito was seen trying to diffuse the situation and apologizing to staff for Laundrie's behavior.

"It was clear that Laundrie was visibly angry and aggressive, causing discomfort to witnesses," Angelo said. "Petito was on a cross-country road trip with Laundrie, traveling in a cargo van they had converted into a makeshift recreational vehicle. The argument led to both Petito and Laundrie eventually leaving the restaurant, with Petito visibly distraught."

The public's attention on the Gabby Petito case intensifies as the search for Brian Laundrie continues. Laundrie, who has been identified as a person of interest in Petito's disappearance, has not been seen or heard from since the couple's road trip.

The altercation at the Merry Piglet restaurant is just one of several incidents that have come to light in recent days, raising concerns about Laundrie's behavior and his relationship with Petito.
