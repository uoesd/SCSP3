UC Santa Cruz Expresses Disappointment and Outrage over Rittenhouse Verdict

The University of California, Santa Cruz community expresses its deep disappointment and outrage over the not guilty verdict in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted of all charges related to the fatal shooting of two unarmed men and wounding another at a Black Lives Matter rally in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020. We stand in solidarity with those who are outraged by this failure of accountability and recognize the harm and distress that such trials cause to Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities.

The Rittenhouse trial is part of a larger pattern of systemic racism and violence against BIPOC communities, highlighted by the recent trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed Black man. These trials serve as painful reminders of the ongoing struggle for justice and equality in our society. As a campus community, we reaffirm our commitment to disrupting systemic racism and working towards a more inclusive and equitable climate.

We recognize that these events can cause significant distress and harm to members of our community, particularly BIPOC students, faculty, and staff. We want to assure everyone that we are committed to providing support and resources to those who are impacted. The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is a resource for support in building a more inclusive climate, and campus services such as counseling and psychological services, and employee assistance programs are available for those feeling impacted.

Furthermore, we want to remind everyone that the Office of Equity and Equal Protection is available to report any incidents of discrimination or harassment. We encourage anyone who experiences or witnesses discriminatory behavior to speak up and seek support.

In times like these, it is essential that we come together as a community to reaffirm our shared values of justice, equity, and inclusion. We must continue to work towards a society that values and respects the lives of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. We will continue to engage in dialogue, education, and action to dismantle systemic racism and create a more just and equitable society for all.
