Tragedy on the Set of "Rust": Jensen Ackles' Firearm Training Comments Resurface as Alec Baldwin Involved in Fatal Accident

Days before the tragic on-set shooting of the movie "Rust," actor Jensen Ackles discussed his firearm training for the film during a fan event. A clip from Ackles' talk was widely circulated online but has since been deleted from many platforms. In the video, Ackles described a brief training session with the film's armorer, focusing on how to load and fire a prop gun.

The fatal on-set accident resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and the wounding of director Joel Souza. Alec Baldwin was involved in the accident, discharging the prop gun that led to the tragedy. There is no evidence suggesting Jensen Ackles was involved in the scene of the shooting.

Alec Baldwin expressed his shock and sadness over the accident on Twitter, stating he is cooperating with the investigation. "My heart is broken for Halyna Hutchins, her family, and Joel Souza. I'm fully cooperating with the investigation," Baldwin tweeted.

The Santa Fe County sheriff's office is investigating the type of projectile discharged and how. "We are still trying to determine the type of projectile that was discharged and how it was discharged," said a spokesman for the Santa Fe County sheriff.

Reports emerged that Baldwin was surprised upon allegedly being given a 'hot gun', not having experienced this before on set. "Alec Baldwin was handed a gun that he was told was safe to use, but it turned out to be a live round," a source close to the production told Variety.

Jensen Ackles has not yet publicly commented on the accident or on his previously recorded gun training comments. His representatives did not respond to requests for comment.

The accident has sparked a renewed debate about gun safety on movie sets. "This is a tragic reminder of the importance of proper safety protocols on movie sets," said a spokesperson for the Screen Actors Guild. "We will be working closely with the production team and the authorities to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to prevent such incidents in the future."

The incident has also raised questions about the use of prop guns on movie sets. "Prop guns are designed to look and feel like real guns, but they are not supposed to fire live rounds," explained a veteran movie armorer. "It's a tragic mistake that this happened, and it's a reminder that safety protocols need to be in place at all times."

The production of "Rust" has been halted indefinitely following the accident. "We are deeply saddened by the tragic accident that occurred on our set," a spokesperson for the production company said in a statement. "We are working closely with the authorities to investigate the incident and ensure that all necessary measures are taken to prevent such incidents in the future."

As the investigation into the accident continues, the movie industry is in shock and mourning. "This is a terrible tragedy, and our hearts go out to the families of Halyna Hutchins and Joel Souza," said a spokesperson for the Directors Guild of America. "We will be working closely with the authorities and the production team to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to prevent such incidents in the future."

In conclusion, the accident on the set of "Rust" is a tragic reminder of the importance of gun safety on movie sets. While Jensen Ackles' firearm training comments have resurfaced in the wake of the accident, there is no evidence suggesting he was involved in the scene of the shooting. The investigation into the accident continues, and the movie industry is in mourning for the loss of Halyna Hutchins and the injury of Joel Souza.
