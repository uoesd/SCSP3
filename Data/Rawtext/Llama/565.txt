US Embassy in Kabul Evacuated as Taliban Take Control of Afghanistan

CNN – The United States embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, has been evacuated as the American flag was taken down, marking the closure of the diplomatic compound. The evacuation comes as the Taliban have taken control of the Presidential Palace in Kabul, with the transition broadcast live by al Jazeera.

According to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, an additional 1,000 US troops have been ordered into Afghanistan, bringing the total to 6,000, to manage the evacuation. "We are taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety and security of our personnel and our Afghan partners," Austin said in a statement.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the evacuation as "deliberate, orderly" and stated that document destruction is standard procedure. "We are doing everything we can to ensure the safety and security of our personnel and our Afghan partners," Blinken said.

Gen. Frank McKenzie, the head of US Central Command, has arrived in the Persian Gulf to oversee the Afghanistan situation. A military team has set up its air traffic control at Kabul airport to increase evacuation flight numbers.

President Joe Biden and senior national security officials are assessing the situation from Camp David via secure video teleconference. Most American diplomats have been moved to Kabul airport to fly back to the US, with a small number of core personnel remaining there.

The Taliban's spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said in a statement that the group has taken control of Kabul and the Presidential Palace, with former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fleeing the country. "We have achieved our goal of establishing an Islamic emirate in Afghanistan," Mujahid said.

The evacuation of the US embassy in Kabul comes as the Taliban have made significant gains across Afghanistan, with the group now in control of the majority of the country. The US has been criticized for its handling of the situation, with some calling for a more robust response to the Taliban's advance.

Gen. Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a statement that the US military is "working closely with our partners in the region to ensure the safety and security of our personnel and our Afghan partners."

CIA Director Bill Burns and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines have also been involved in the situation, providing intelligence and analysis to senior officials.

The evacuation of the US embassy in Kabul is a significant moment in the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, and it remains to be seen what the future holds for the country and its people.

In a statement, President Biden said, "We will continue to work closely with our partners in the region to ensure the safety and security of our personnel and our Afghan partners. We will also continue to support the Afghan people in their efforts to build a peaceful and stable future."

The situation in Afghanistan remains fluid and volatile, and CNN will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available.
