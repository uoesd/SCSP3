Long Island Woman Gabby Petito Missing After Cross-Country Trip, Family Appeals for Help

Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old woman from Long Island, New York, has been reported missing after her family lost contact with her during a cross-country trip with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie. Petito's stepfather, James Schmidt, a former fire chief, has traveled to Wyoming to join the search efforts.

According to Schmidt, Petito was last known to be in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, in late August. She had been traveling with Laundrie in a converted van, documenting their adventures on social media. However, her family became concerned when her updates ceased in late August.

"We're worried sick," said Schmidt. "Gabby's always been a free spirit, but she's never been out of touch this long. We just want to know she's safe."

Laundrie has returned to Florida without Petito and has refused to cooperate with authorities. Police in North Port, Florida, have expressed interest in talking to Laundrie but have not accused him of any wrongdoing.

"We understand that Brian has lawyered up, but we just want him to tell us where Gabby is," said Nicole Schmidt, Petito's mother. "We're not accusing him of anything, we just want to find Gabby."

Petito's family has urged Laundrie to provide any information on her whereabouts. "We're pleading with Brian to come forward and tell us what happened," said Schmidt. "He's the only person who knows where Gabby is."

The van life nature of their trip means that Petito and Laundrie could be anywhere in the country, and Petito's biological father has urged the public to look out for anything "fishy."

"We're asking everyone to keep an eye out for Gabby and Brian's van," said Joseph Petito. "They could be anywhere, and we need all the help we can get."

Both the Schmidt and Petito families are appealing for help in locating Gabby. "We're desperate for any information that can lead us to Gabby," said Nicole Schmidt. "We just want her home safe and sound."

The search for Petito has garnered attention on social media, with many using the hashtag #FindGabby to share information and offer support to her family.

Anyone with information on Petito's whereabouts is urged to contact the North Port Police Department at (941) 429-7300.

In conclusion, the disappearance of Gabby Petito has sent shockwaves through her community, and her family is desperate for any information that can lead them to her. As the search continues, the public is urged to remain vigilant and report any sightings of Petito or her van.
