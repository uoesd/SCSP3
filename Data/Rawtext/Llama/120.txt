Unvaccinated and Battling Covid-19: A Mississippi Woman's Plea for Vaccination

CNN – In the heart of Mississippi, Alicia Ball is fighting a tough battle. Her husband, William, has been hospitalized for over 22 days, battling Covid-19. The couple's story highlights the growing concerns about the Delta variant's impact on unvaccinated individuals, especially in states with low vaccination rates.

Alicia, who was vaccinated, recovered from Covid-19 in just 10 days, a testament to the vaccine's effectiveness. However, her husband's situation is a stark reminder of the risks faced by those who choose not to get vaccinated.

"It's been a nightmare," Alicia told CNN's Chris Cuomo. "I never thought I'd see my husband like this. He's always been so strong and healthy."

The Balls were initially hesitant to get vaccinated due to a lack of information on the virus's severity and the vaccine's effects. "We didn't know much about it, and we were scared," Alicia admitted.

However, Alicia's asthma condition made her particularly vulnerable to the virus. Under her doctor's care, she decided to get vaccinated. "I knew I had to protect myself, and my husband," she said.

Mississippi, where the Balls reside, has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S., with only 34.4% of the population fully vaccinated. The state is experiencing high transmission rates of Covid-19, with 336 cases per 100,000 people.

The Delta variant is spreading rapidly across the U.S., leading to increased safety restrictions and mask guidance. While fully vaccinated individuals can still contract the Delta variant, symptoms are typically milder.

Alicia's story highlights the importance of vaccination, especially in communities with low vaccination rates. "I hope sharing my story will encourage others, including family, friends, and church members, to get vaccinated," she said.

Chris Cuomo, anchor of CNN's Cuomo Prime Time, emphasized the urgency of the situation. "The Delta variant is a game-changer. We can't afford to be complacent. We must take action now."

Alicia's message is clear: vaccination is crucial to protect ourselves and our loved ones. "I don't want anyone to go through what my husband and I are going through," she said. "Get vaccinated. It's the best way to protect yourself and your community."

As the Delta variant continues to spread, Alicia's story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of vaccination. The fight against Covid-19 is far from over, and every individual has a role to play in preventing the virus's spread.

In conclusion, Alicia Ball's story is a poignant reminder of the impact of Covid-19 on unvaccinated individuals and the importance of vaccination, especially in communities with low vaccination rates. The Delta variant's spread highlights the urgent need for action, and Alicia's message is clear: get vaccinated to protect yourself and your loved ones.
