Schrader Apologizes for 'Lynching' Comment, Faces Backlash from Colleagues and Constituents

U.S. Rep. Kurt Schrader, a moderate Democrat representing Oregon's 5th congressional district, has faced intense criticism for his recent comment likening the possible impeachment of President Trump to a "lynching." Schrader made the comment during a House Democratic caucus call, expressing his opposition to impeaching Trump for inciting the Capitol riot.

Mark Wiener, a Portland political consultant who had been working with Schrader, immediately ended their relationship over the comment. Wiener criticized Schrader for equating impeachment with lynching, highlighting the insurrection's link to white supremacy.

"Lynching is a term that has a very specific and painful history in America, and it is not appropriate to use it in this context," Wiener said in a statement. "I cannot in good conscience continue to work with someone who would make such a hurtful and insensitive comment."

U.S. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, a fellow Oregon Democrat, also condemned Schrader's remarks as hurtful and insensitive. "The history of lynching in this country is a painful reminder of the violence and discrimination that people of color have faced for generations," Bonamici said. "It is not something to be taken lightly or used as a political metaphor."

Schrader has since apologized for his comment, acknowledging the historical context and insensitivity of his words. "I understand that my comment was hurtful and inappropriate, and I apologize for any pain or offense that it may have caused," Schrader said in a statement. "I am committed to being a better ally and advocate for marginalized communities, and I will work to rebuild trust and move forward in a positive and inclusive way."

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has announced plans to impeach President Trump, urged his immediate resignation. "The President's actions have gravely damaged the nation, and he must be held accountable," Pelosi said. "We cannot allow him to continue to harm our democracy and our people."

Schrader, a moderate Democrat, has previously diverged from party lines, notably on stimulus check increases. Despite a primary challenge, he was reelected in November, representing a district that includes Portland suburbs and parts of Oregon.

In the wake of his comment, Schrader has begun reaching out to colleagues to express understanding of the harm caused and to rebuild trust. It remains to be seen how his comment will impact his political future, but it is clear that he has a lot of work to do to repair relationships with his constituents and colleagues.

In a statement, Wiener emphasized the importance of acknowledging and learning from mistakes. "I appreciate Rep. Schrader's apology, but it's not enough," Wiener said. "We need to do better, and we need to hold our leaders accountable for their words and actions."

As the nation continues to grapple with the aftermath of the Capitol riot and the ongoing debate over impeachment, it is clear that words have power, and that leaders must be mindful of the impact their words can have on marginalized communities.

In a time of deep division and polarization, it is more important than ever that our leaders work to build bridges and foster understanding, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes and divisions. Whether Schrader can recover from this controversy remains to be seen, but it is clear that he has a lot of work to do to regain the trust of his constituents and colleagues.
