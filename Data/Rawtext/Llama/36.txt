Strictly FX Lights Up the Sky for Biden-Harris Inauguration Day Celebration

Strictly FX, a company founded in Chicago in 1996, had the honor of designing the fireworks display for the Biden-Harris Inauguration Day celebration. Although the company has since moved its headquarters to Nashville, it still maintains operations in Chicago and California. Adam Biscow, the designer from Strictly FX, emphasized the collaborative effort behind the show and the desire to create a memorable piece of history.

The fireworks display was truly a sight to behold, utilizing about 20,000 shells and choreographed to Katy Perry's performance of "Firework". To accommodate camera angles and protect the National Mall's grass, two separate launch zones were used for the fireworks. The aesthetic of the display was designed to highlight the Washington Monument with vibrant colors and large bursts.

Planning for the display began right after the November election, and a crew of 26 from Strictly FX and Garden State Fireworks worked tirelessly to set up the display. Chris Santore, from Garden State Fireworks, praised the execution and scale of the display, saying, "It was an incredible experience to be a part of such a historic event."

The synchronization of the fireworks was also a notable aspect of the display. Fireworks were not launched until Katy Perry reached a specific verse in the song, emphasizing the importance of timing and coordination. Matt Peterson, a designer from Melrose Pyrotechnics, shared a related anecdote about a canceled Obama election victory fireworks display, highlighting the challenges and uncertainties that come with planning such large-scale events.

Despite the challenges, the fireworks display was a resounding success, with experts from the pyrotechnics industry praising its execution and scale. Adam Biscow, the designer from Strictly FX, expressed his pride in being a part of such a historic moment, saying, "It was an honor to be a part of this celebration and to help create a memorable piece of history."

The Biden-Harris Inauguration Day celebration was a momentous occasion, and Strictly FX's fireworks display was the perfect way to cap off the evening's festivities. The company's dedication to creating a memorable and awe-inspiring display was evident in every aspect of the show, from the vibrant colors to the precise synchronization.

As the fireworks lit up the sky, Americans from all over the country were able to come together and celebrate this momentous occasion. The Biden-Harris Inauguration Day celebration will be remembered for years to come, and Strictly FX's fireworks display will be a big part of that memory.

In conclusion, Strictly FX's fireworks display for the Biden-Harris Inauguration Day celebration was a truly unforgettable sight. The company's commitment to creating a memorable piece of history was evident in every aspect of the display, from the vibrant colors to the precise synchronization. The fireworks display was a fitting way to cap off the evening's festivities and will be remembered for years to come.
