SEPT 14 (Reuters) – In a shocking turn of events, a 504-pound alligator was found with human remains in its stomach, believed to be those of 71-year-old Timothy Satterlee Sr, who went missing during Hurricane Ida. The discovery ended a two-week search for Satterlee, who was last seen checking storm damage outside his Slidell, Louisiana home.

According to Captain Lance Vitter, spokesperson for the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office, the alligator was caught by Louisiana Department of Wildlife licensed nuisance hunters. "We received a call from a resident who spotted the alligator near the Satterlee home, and our wildlife agents used a drone to locate and capture it," Vitter said.

The alligator, which is unusually large for the region, was found to have human remains in its stomach, leading the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office to announce the finding and begin the process of verifying the remains with the coroner's office.

Satterlee's wife witnessed the alligator attack her husband, resulting in the loss of one of his arms. She sought help but found her husband missing upon return. The incident has left the local community in shock, where Satterlee was known as a community pillar.

The attack occurred the day after Hurricane Ida caused devastating flooding in Louisiana, highlighting the severity of the incident. "We are deeply saddened by this tragic event and our thoughts and prayers are with the Satterlee family," Vitter said.

The discovery of the alligator with human remains in its stomach has raised concerns about the safety of residents in the area. "We want to assure the public that we are taking this incident very seriously and are working to ensure the safety of everyone in the community," Vitter added.

The St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office is urging residents to be cautious and avoid approaching any wildlife that may have been displaced by the storm. "We understand that people may be curious, but it's important to remember that wild animals can be dangerous, especially in times of stress and displacement," Vitter said.

The incident has sparked a larger conversation about the role of alligators in Louisiana's ecosystem and the measures that can be taken to prevent such attacks in the future. While alligators are a common sight in the state, attacks on humans are rare.

The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries is working closely with local authorities to investigate the incident and prevent any further attacks. "We are committed to ensuring the safety of both humans and wildlife in Louisiana, and we will do everything in our power to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future," a spokesperson for the department said.

As the community comes to terms with this tragic event, the focus is on supporting the Satterlee family and ensuring the safety of all residents. The incident serves as a reminder of the power of nature and the importance of being vigilant and prepared in the face of natural disasters.
