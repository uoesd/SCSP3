Petition for $2,000 Monthly Stimulus Payments Reaches 2.8 Million Signatures

A Change.org petition calling for $2,000 monthly stimulus payments to Americans has garnered over 2.8 million signatures, with a goal of reaching 3 million signatures to become one of the top signed petitions on the platform. The petition, created by Stephanie Bonin, emphasizes the need for immediate and recurring payments during the pandemic.

"The pandemic has left many people struggling to make ends meet, and it's clear that a one-time payment of $1,400, or even $2,000, is not enough to cover the expenses of Americans who have been out of work for months," Bonin said in a statement. "We need recurring payments to help people stay afloat until the economy fully recovers."

In addition to Bonin's petition, five other Change.org petitions for monthly stimulus checks are gaining attention. However, with the current economic improvement, a fourth stimulus check from the White House or Congress is unlikely at this time. There has been no direct legislation passed for a fourth stimulus check by the Biden administration or Congress.

Rumors of a $7,000 fourth stimulus check being distributed this week have also been circulating, but they are false. The U.S. government has issued three rounds of stimulus payments since the start of the pandemic, with varying amounts. The first stimulus payment was up to $1,200 in March 2020, followed by $600 in December 2020 and up to $1,400 in March 2021.

Despite the lack of a fourth stimulus check, Bonin remains hopeful that her petition will bring attention to the ongoing struggles of Americans during the pandemic. "We're not asking for a handout, we're asking for a lifeline," Bonin said. "We need our government to recognize that the pandemic is still affecting people's lives and livelihoods, and to take action to help."

The petition has gained support from people across the country, with many sharing their personal stories of struggle and hardship. "I'm a single mother of two, and I've been out of work since March 2020," said one signatory. "I've depleted my savings and am struggling to make ends meet. A monthly stimulus payment would be a godsend."

Another signatory, a small business owner, said, "I've had to close my business temporarily due to the pandemic, and I'm struggling to pay my bills. A monthly stimulus payment would help me keep my business afloat until things get back to normal."

While the petition continues to gain signatures, it remains to be seen whether it will lead to action from the government. However, it has brought attention to the ongoing struggles of Americans during the pandemic and the need for continued support.
