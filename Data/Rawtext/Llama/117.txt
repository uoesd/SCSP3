Fear and Exhaustion Among Healthcare Workers as Texas Lifts Covid-19 Restrictions

CNN – Houston, Texas

As Texas Governor Greg Abbott lifts the statewide mask mandate and capacity limits on businesses, healthcare workers like Brittany Smart are expressing fear and exhaustion. Smart, an ICU nurse in Texas, has been on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic and has seen firsthand the devastating impact of the virus.

"I'm scared. I'm scared for my patients, I'm scared for my colleagues, and I'm scared for myself," Smart said. "We've worked so hard to get to this point, and now it feels like we're taking a step backward."

Despite vaccinations and previously declining Covid-19 cases, healthcare workers like Smart see the mandate lift as premature. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky noted that the steep decline in Covid-19 cases is leveling off at very high numbers.

"We're still averaging over 65,000 new cases daily in the US, and Texas is reporting over 6,600 new cases and over 270 deaths in a single day," Walensky said. "It's concerning to see restrictions being lifted when we're still seeing such high numbers."

Smart highlighted that Covid-19 patients are still dying, despite reduced hospital overcrowding. "We've made progress, but we're not out of the woods yet," she said. "I've seen patients die from this virus, and it's heartbreaking. I don't want to see any more lives lost due to easing restrictions."

Experts warn of a potential surge in cases due to highly contagious variants circulating in the US. "We're not just dealing with the original strain of Covid-19 anymore," Walensky said. "These new variants are highly transmissible and could lead to a spike in cases if we're not careful."

Smart's biggest fear is the loss of more lives due to easing restrictions. "I understand the desire to get back to normal, but we can't let our guard down," she said. "We need to keep taking precautions, keep wearing masks, and keep social distancing. It's the only way we can protect ourselves and our communities."

As Texas lifts its mask mandate, healthcare workers like Smart are urging the public to remain vigilant. "We've come so far, but we're not done yet," Smart said. "Let's not give up now. Let's keep fighting this virus and keep our communities safe."

In conclusion, the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions in Texas has left healthcare workers like Brittany Smart feeling fearful and exhausted. Despite progress made in reducing cases, the virus is still circulating at high levels, and experts warn of a potential surge in cases due to highly contagious variants. Smart and other healthcare workers are urging the public to remain vigilant and continue taking precautions to protect themselves and their communities.
