Harris Swears in New Senators, Marking a New Era in the Senate

Vice President Kamala Harris made history on Wednesday as she swore in three new Democratic senators, marking her first presiding role in the Senate. With the new additions, the Senate is now evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, giving Harris the tiebreaking vote and making Charles E. Schumer the Senate majority leader.

Harris' role provides Democrats with a significant advantage in the Senate, as she can cast tiebreaking votes in the event of a 50-50 split. This power has been exercised by her predecessors, and Harris may find herself called upon to do the same.

Vermont Democrat Patrick J. Leahy resumed the role of Senate president pro tempore, making him the second-highest-ranking official in the Senate. Leahy has held this position before, and his experience will be valuable in the new Congress.

Schumer and McConnell are currently negotiating the power dynamics for the minority party in the Senate. Schumer emphasized the Senate's intention to be active, responsive, and bipartisan where possible. McConnell, on the other hand, called for finding common ground for the common good between both parties.

One of the first orders of business for the new Senate was the confirmation of Avril Haines as director of national intelligence. Haines was confirmed after a brief hold by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. Her confirmation marks a significant milestone for the Biden administration, as Haines is the first woman to hold this position.

The swearing-in ceremony was attended by several high-profile guests, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Harris' vice presidency and Pelosi's speakership mark historical high offices held by women from California. Sen. Dianne Feinstein highlighted the increase of women in the Senate and the House since 1992, noting that women now make up 25% of the Senate and 23% of the House.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., also attended the ceremony and emphasized the importance of bipartisanship in the new Congress. "We have to work together," Klobuchar said. "We have to find common ground, and we have to get things done."

In a statement, Harris praised the new senators, saying, "I am proud to welcome these three outstanding individuals to the Senate. They bring a wealth of experience and a deep commitment to public service. I look forward to working with them to address the challenges facing our nation."

Schumer also released a statement, saying, "I am thrilled to welcome our new colleagues to the Senate. They are all highly qualified and dedicated public servants, and I am confident that they will be valuable additions to our caucus."

McConnell, too, welcomed the new senators, saying, "I am glad to see our colleagues from both sides of the aisle being sworn in today. I look forward to working with them to find common ground and move our country forward."

The swearing-in ceremony marked the beginning of a new era in the Senate, with Harris at the helm. With her tiebreaking vote and Schumer's leadership, Democrats are poised to make significant strides in the new Congress.
