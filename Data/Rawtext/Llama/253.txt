COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake Stalls Among Teenagers, Concerns Over Safety and Access Persist

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect families worldwide, vaccine uptake among teenagers has stalled, with about half of parents of 12-17 year-olds reporting their teen has been vaccinated, according to a recent survey. The survey, conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), also found that about 16% of parents of children ages 5 to 11 report their child has been vaccinated, with another 13% planning to do so 'right away'.

However, three in ten parents of both teens and younger children say they will 'definitely not' get their child vaccinated for COVID-19. Safety and potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines for kids are major concerns among parents, with Hispanic, Black, and lower-income parents expressing more concern over access barriers to vaccinating their children.

Pediatricians are the most trusted source of vaccine information for parents, though fewer than half have discussed COVID-19 vaccinations with their child's healthcare provider. The survey found that about half of parents say their child's school provided information or encouraged COVID-19 vaccination. Interestingly, parents who report their school encouraged COVID-19 vaccination are more likely to have vaccinated children.

Despite the efforts to encourage vaccination, parents of 5-17 year-olds largely oppose schools requiring COVID-19 vaccines for eligible students, preferring personal choice over collective responsibility. This sentiment is particularly pronounced among lower-income and minority groups, who have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on parents and families, affecting mental health, financial stability, and children's education, especially among lower-income and minority groups. As the pandemic continues, it is crucial that parents have access to accurate information and resources to make informed decisions about their children's health. Addressing concerns over safety and access, as well as promoting equitable vaccine distribution, will be essential in ensuring that all children are protected from COVID-19.

In conclusion, while vaccine uptake among teenagers has stalled, there are steps that can be taken to address the concerns of parents and promote vaccination among children. By providing accurate information, addressing access barriers, and promoting equitable distribution, we can work towards protecting all children from COVID-19.
