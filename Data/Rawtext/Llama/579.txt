Afghan Baby Liya, Symbol of Chaotic U.S. Withdrawal, Now Safe with Family in Phoenix

The story of Liya, the Afghan baby girl who was passed to U.S. troops over a wall outside Kabul airport in August, has captured the hearts of many. Now, it has come to light that Liya is safely residing with her family in Phoenix, Arizona.

Liya was just 16 days old when she became a symbol of the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Her father, Hameed, a linguist and cultural adviser, arranged for her to be passed to the Marines, recognizing that his family needed assistance.

"I briefly held Liya before handing her to another Marine to assist my wife, who had been robbed by the Taliban," Hameed recalled.

The image of Liya being lifted over barbed wire went viral on social media amid the Taliban's takeover. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby confirmed in August that Liya was returned to her father and treated for an illness at a Norwegian hospital at the airport.

"We are grateful for the safe return of Liya and her family," Kirby said in a statement. "Their safety and well-being are of the utmost importance to us."

Hameed, who is considering adding "Marine" as Liya's middle name, called his daughter "a fighter."

"She's a strong girl, just like her name," he said. "She's been through a lot, but she's doing well now."

However, controversy surrounds the identity of the Marine who lifted Liya over the wall. Lance Cpl. Hunter Clark claimed at a Trump rally to be the one who lifted Liya, but the Marine Corps denies it was him. Clark is under investigation for potentially violating Pentagon policies by speaking at a partisan event.

Clark's mother, when asked for comment, stated that her son could not talk to the media due to the ongoing investigation.

Despite the controversy, Liya's family is focusing on their new life in Phoenix. They are grateful for the support they have received and are looking forward to building a new home in the United States.

"We are so thankful for the opportunity to start a new life here," Hameed said. "We are excited to see what the future holds for Liya and our family."

As for Liya, she is adjusting well to her new home and surroundings. Her family reports that she is a happy and curious baby, always eager to explore and learn.

The story of Liya and her family serves as a reminder of the human cost of war and the importance of compassion and assistance in times of crisis. As Liya grows up, she will undoubtedly be a symbol of hope and resilience for her family and for many others around the world.
