Facebook Whistleblower Accuses Company of Prioritizing Profit Over Combating Hate Speech, Misinformation

Oct 3 (Reuters) – A Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen, has accused the company of prioritizing profit over combating hate speech and misinformation, alleging that the social media giant was aware of its platforms fostering discord and harming teens but chose to prioritize its financial interests.

Haugen, a product manager on Facebook's Civic Misinformation Team, revealed her identity on the CBS program "60 Minutes" on Sunday, following a series of Wall Street Journal stories that scrutinized Facebook's practices. She has also filed at least eight complaints with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging that Facebook violated federal securities laws by misleading investors about its efforts to combat misinformation and hate speech.

In an interview with "60 Minutes," Haugen claimed that Facebook's algorithms were designed to prioritize content that generated high engagement, which often meant promoting content that was controversial or sensational. She alleged that Facebook was aware of the impact its platforms were having on teens, but chose to do nothing because it was concerned about losing users and revenue.

Haugen's allegations have sparked outrage and calls for greater regulation of social media companies. In a statement, Facebook spokesperson Lena Pietsch contested Haugen's accusations, saying that the company had made significant improvements in recent years in curbing harmful content on its platforms.

However, Haugen's attorney, John Tye, confirmed that they had shared internal Facebook documents with several state attorneys general and intended to discuss regulatory actions internationally. Tye founded Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit organization that provides legal and other support to whistleblowers. A GoFundMe page has also been set up to support Haugen's legal expenses.

Haugen's allegations have also raised questions about Facebook's role in the January 6 Capitol riot. She claimed that Facebook deactivated safety systems post-election, which contributed to the organizing of the riot. However, Facebook Vice President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg called the idea that social media caused the January 6 Capitol riot "ludicrous."

Haugen is set to testify at a Senate subcommittee hearing titled "Protecting Kids Online" on Tuesday, where she will discuss Instagram's impact on teens. Her testimony is expected to be a key moment in the ongoing debate over how to regulate social media companies and protect users from harmful content.

In response to Haugen's allegations, Facebook has announced that it will freeze its political donations for the time being. The company has also said that it will introduce new measures to combat misinformation and hate speech on its platforms.

The controversy surrounding Haugen's allegations has highlighted the ongoing debate over the role of social media in society and the need for greater regulation of these companies. As lawmakers and regulators continue to scrutinize Facebook's practices, it remains to be seen how the company will respond to the mounting pressure and what changes it will make to protect its users from harmful content.
