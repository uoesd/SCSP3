KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor: Parents' Attitudes and Experiences with Vaccinations and School Safety

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect communities worldwide, the KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor has been tracking public attitudes and experiences with vaccinations, school safety, and other related issues. The latest survey results reveal important trends and insights into parents' perspectives on vaccinating their children, school policies, and concerns about the virus.

According to the survey, 48% of parents of children ages 12-17 report that their child has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. This is a significant increase from previous months, indicating a growing acceptance of vaccination among parents. However, there is still a significant portion of parents who are hesitant to vaccinate their children, with 32% saying they will "wait and see" before getting their 5-11 year old vaccinated, and 24% stating they definitely will not vaccinate their child in this age group.

The survey also found that about a third (34%) of parents say they will vaccinate their 5-11 year old child "right away" once a vaccine is authorized for their age group. This suggests that there is a significant segment of parents who are eager to protect their children from the virus but are waiting for the vaccine to be approved for their age group.

When it comes to school policies, 58% of parents believe K-12 schools should require all students and staff to wear masks. This is consistent with the finding that 69% of parents with a child attending in-person school say their school is requiring masks for all students and staff. However, only 6% of parents report that their school district offers routine COVID-19 testing to students not eligible for the vaccine.

The survey also revealed that 23% of parents of a child attending in-person school report their child has been required to quarantine due to a possible COVID-19 exposure. This highlights the ongoing challenges schools face in maintaining a safe environment for students and staff during the pandemic.

Despite these challenges, 66% of parents with a child attending in-person school believe their child's school is doing the right amount to limit the spread of COVID-19. This suggests that parents generally have confidence in the measures schools are taking to protect their children.

However, concerns about the virus remain high, with 57% of parents worried their child may get seriously sick from coronavirus. This concern is higher among Hispanic and lower-income parents, highlighting the need for continued outreach and support to these communities.

In conclusion, the KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor provides valuable insights into parents' attitudes and experiences with vaccinations, school safety, and concerns about the virus. The survey results suggest that while there has been progress in vaccination rates, there is still work to be done to address parents' concerns and ensure that all children have access to safe and effective vaccines. By continuing to track these trends, we can better understand the evolving needs of communities and work towards a safer and healthier future for all.
