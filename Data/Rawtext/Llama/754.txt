Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert Faces Backlash for Wearing Controversial T-Shirt Referencing Alec Baldwin and 'Rust' Film Set Shooting

In a move that has sparked outrage and disbelief, Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert was spotted wearing a t-shirt with a message that many see as disrespectful towards the victim of the 'Rust' film set shooting, Halyna Hutchins, and her family. The t-shirt reads, "GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE ALEC BALDWIN DOES," a reference to the accidental shooting that occurred on the set of the film when Alec Baldwin mistakenly discharged a prop gun, killing Hutchins.

Actor Marty Lindsey, who is also from Colorado and was impacted by the tragedy, expressed his disgust at Boebert's actions, calling them "unconscionable." In a statement, Lindsey said, "It's absolutely unconscionable that Representative Boebert would wear a shirt like that. It shows a complete disregard for Halyna Hutchins' family and the tragedy that they've had to endure."

Boebert's office has not commented on the matter, but the backlash has been swift and severe. Many have taken to social media to express their outrage and disappointment in the representative's actions.

This is not the first time Boebert has made headlines for her controversial statements or actions. She has a history of using clothing to make political statements, and has been known to mock Alec Baldwin in the past. In fact, she made a tweet referencing him the day after Hutchins' death, which many saw as insensitive and disrespectful.

Lindsey, who is also a producer on the film, expressed his disappointment in Boebert's connection to Colorado, saying, "It's disappointing to see someone from our state, who is supposed to represent us, behaving in such a way. It's not the Colorado values that we stand for."

The t-shirt that Boebert wore is not the only one of its kind. An online store run by Donald Trump, Jr. also sells a similar shirt, which has been met with equal outrage.

The incident that sparked this controversy occurred on October 21st, when Alec Baldwin accidentally discharged a prop gun while filming a scene for the movie 'Rust.' The shot killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza. The incident is still under investigation, and many in the film industry have called for better safety protocols to prevent such tragedies in the future.

In the wake of this incident, many have come together to support Hutchins' family and to call for change in the film industry. Boebert's actions, however, have been seen as a stark contrast to the unity and compassion that has been displayed by many others.

As the controversy continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how Boebert will respond to the backlash and whether she will take responsibility for her actions. For now, many in Colorado and beyond are left shaking their heads in disbelief at the representative's insensitive and disrespectful behavior.
