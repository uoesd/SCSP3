France Advises Against Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine for Under 30s Due to Myocarditis Risks

Paris - The French Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS) has recommended against the use of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax, for individuals under the age of 30 due to concerns over the risk of myocarditis, a rare inflammatory heart condition. The recommendation is based on recent data and a French study published on Monday, which found that the risk of myocarditis is five times lesser with Pfizer's Comirnaty jab compared to Moderna's Spikevax for under 30s.

The HAS recommendation applies to the Moderna vaccine's use as a first, second, or third 'booster' dose for under 30s. For those aged over 30, HAS recommends the Moderna vaccine, citing its slightly superior effectiveness. The recommendation will remain valid until more scientific data on the issue is available.

The European Union's drug regulator, EMA, approved Moderna's booster vaccine for all over 18s, six months after the second dose. EMA found a possible link between rare inflammatory heart conditions and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from both Pfizer and Moderna. Despite the finding, EMA states the benefits of mRNA vaccines in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks.

The U.S. regulators and the World Health Organization echo EMA's view on the benefits of mRNA vaccines. The HAS recommendation comes as a precautionary measure to minimize the risks associated with the Moderna vaccine, particularly for young individuals.

In a statement, HAS emphasized that the risk of myocarditis associated with the Moderna vaccine is still very rare, but the authority wants to take a cautious approach to ensure the safety of the population. The recommendation will be reviewed and updated as new data becomes available.

The Moderna vaccine has been widely used in France, and the country has seen a significant decline in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations since the vaccination campaign began. The HAS recommendation is aimed at ensuring that the vaccination campaign continues to be effective while minimizing the risks associated with the vaccine.
