Newsmax Anchor Walks Off Set During Interview with My Pillow CEO Over Election Fraud Claims

In a dramatic turn of events, Newsmax anchor Bob Sellers walked off set during a live interview with My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell after repeated attempts to halt Lindell's falsehoods about the election. The interview was intended to discuss Twitter suspensions and "cancel culture," but devolved when Lindell reiterated false claims about the election.

Lindell's personal and corporate Twitter accounts were suspended for spreading false election fraud claims. This move came after Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic raised the possibility of legal action against Newsmax for false reporting, prompting the network to air a segment refuting election fraud claims. Dominion has filed a $1.3 billion defamation suit against Sidney Powell, a former Trump lawyer, for making baseless claims about the company.

During the interview, Lindell claimed that the election was "stolen" and that there was "massive fraud" involved. However, Newsmax anchor Heather Childers and Bob Sellers tried to steer the conversation away from election fraud claims, citing lack of evidence. Sellers read aloud Newsmax's position accepting the election results as legal and final and their inability to verify fraud allegations.

Despite attempts to interrupt and redirect, Lindell continued his claims, leading Sellers to walk off set. "I'm not going to sit here and allow you to continue to make these false claims," Sellers said before exiting the stage.

Newsmax issued a statement after the interview, emphasizing their different viewpoint from Lindell's but acknowledging his right to an opinion. "At Newsmax, we strive to provide a platform for diverse perspectives and opinions. While we respect Mike Lindell's right to express his views, we cannot allow false information to go unchallenged," the statement read.

Brian Peterson, a spokesman for Newsmax, told USA TODAY that the network takes its responsibility to provide accurate information seriously. "We understand that this is a sensitive topic, and we want to make it clear that we do not support or condone the spread of false information," Peterson said.

The incident comes after Twitter permanently suspended President Trump's account earlier in January following the Capitol riot. The social media platform has been cracking down on accounts that spread misinformation and violate their terms of service.

In a statement, Twitter said, "We suspended @MyPillowUSA's account for violating our policy on spreading misinformation. We will continue to take action against accounts that violate our rules and put the safety of our users at risk."

Lindell has been a vocal supporter of President Trump and has repeatedly made baseless claims about the election. He has also faced backlash from other social media platforms, including YouTube, which removed a video he posted making false claims about the election.

The controversy surrounding Lindell's interview with Newsmax highlights the ongoing debate over the role of media in spreading misinformation. While some argue that media outlets have a responsibility to provide a platform for diverse perspectives, others believe that they must take a stronger stance against false information.

In a statement, Dominion Voting Systems said, "We appreciate Newsmax's efforts to correct the record and refute false claims about our company. We will continue to take legal action against those who spread misinformation and damage our reputation."

The incident also raises questions about the role of social media in shaping public opinion and the responsibility of media outlets to provide accurate information. As the debate continues, it is clear that the issue of misinformation will remain a pressing concern for media outlets and social media platforms alike.
