Trump Lawyers Argue Impeachment Should be Dismissed, Citing Free Speech and Lack of Due Process

Lawyers for former President Donald Trump have filed a legal brief arguing that his impeachment should be dismissed, citing protected free speech and a lack of due process. The brief, submitted by Trump's legal team, Bruce Castor and David Schoen, claims that Trump's speech on January 6, which preceded the storming of the US Capitol, is protected by the First Amendment and did not incite the violence that followed.

"The impeachment of Donald J. Trump is a dangerous precedent that threatens to undermine the very foundations of our democracy," the brief states. "It is a brazen attempt to circumvent the will of the American people and overturn the results of a free and fair election."

Trump's lawyers argue that his impeachment lacks due process and is unconstitutional because he is no longer in office. They claim that the House Democrats' impeachment efforts are political theater, designed to damage Trump's reputation and undermine his political future.

"The House Democrats' impeachment inquiry was a sham, lacking any semblance of due process or fairness," Castor said in a statement. "Their efforts to impeach President Trump are a clear violation of his constitutional rights and a dangerous threat to the rule of law."

Schoen added, "The impeachment of President Trump is a travesty of justice, and it is our duty as lawyers to defend his rights and protect the Constitution."

Trump was impeached on a charge of "incitement of insurrection" after the Capitol was stormed on January 6, following a rally and speech near the White House. The legal brief suggests that the Capitol riot was preplanned, citing law enforcement reports of potential attacks.

Senate leaders have agreed on a timeline for the impeachment trial, allowing four days for opening arguments. The decision on calling witnesses, including possibly Trump himself, will be made early next week.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement, "The agreed timeline preserves due process for both sides and ensures a fair and thorough trial."

Republican leader Mitch McConnell echoed Schumer's sentiments, saying, "The timeline agreed upon by both sides ensures a fair and expeditious trial, and I look forward to hearing the arguments presented by both sides."

The impeachment trial is set to begin on February 9, with the Senate expected to vote on whether to convict Trump on February 16. A two-thirds majority vote is required for conviction.

Trump's legal team is expected to present their arguments in person on February 9, with the House Democrats' impeachment managers presenting their case on February 10.

The impeachment trial is a significant moment in American history, with the outcome potentially setting a precedent for future presidents and their conduct in office.

In conclusion, Trump's lawyers argue that his impeachment should be dismissed, citing protected free speech and a lack of due process. The impeachment trial is set to begin on February 9, with the Senate expected to vote on whether to convict Trump on February 16. The outcome of the trial could have significant implications for the future of American democracy.
