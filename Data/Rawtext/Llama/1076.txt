Search for Gabby Petito Shifts to Wyoming, Boyfriend Named Person of Interest

SALT LAKE CITY – The search for missing YouTuber Gabby Petito has shifted focus to Wyoming, following her last known communications. FOX 13 News has confirmed that Petito was last seen at a Fairfield Inn and Suites near Salt Lake City International Airport on August 24.

Hotel staff reported that the FBI and police officers recently visited the hotel and confirmed that Petito stayed there for more than a day. James Schmidt, Petito's stepfather, emphasized the efforts of law enforcement in the search and their collective work.

"We are grateful for the tireless efforts of the FBI, Salt Lake City Police Department, and all the law enforcement agencies involved in searching for Gabby," Schmidt said. "We will continue to support them in any way we can to ensure Gabby's safe return."

Richard Stafford, a spokesman for the Petito family, criticized Brian Laundrie, Petito's boyfriend, for not cooperating with the police.

"It's unfortunate that Brian Laundrie has chosen not to cooperate with the authorities," Stafford said. "We implore him to reconsider and provide any information he may have regarding Gabby's disappearance."

Laundrie returned home in early September without Petito and has since hired a lawyer and refused to cooperate with police. He has been named a person of interest but not a suspect in her disappearance.

The Petito family has expressed their gratitude for the efforts of law enforcement and the public's support in the search for Gabby. They have also urged anyone with information regarding her disappearance to come forward.

"We are grateful for the outpouring of support from the public and the tireless efforts of law enforcement," Schmidt said. "We will continue to work together to bring Gabby home safely."

The investigation into Petito's disappearance remains ongoing, with law enforcement agencies working around the clock to locate her. The public is urged to remain vigilant and report any sightings or information that may be relevant to the case.

As the search for Gabby Petito continues, the public's help is crucial in bringing her home safely. Anyone with information is urged to contact the FBI or local law enforcement agencies immediately.
