Texas Towns Take the Lead in Aggressive Speed Traps

Two small towns in Texas have been identified as having the most aggressive speed traps in the state, according to a recent analysis by the Houston Chronicle. The towns, Bruceville-Eddy and Rosebud, have been using speeding tickets as a significant source of revenue, with Rosebud topping the list with 1,385 stops per officer in 2020.

The Houston Chronicle analyzed traffic stop data from over 2,500 police departments in Texas and identified the top 21 towns for traffic stops in 2020, with more than 500 stops per officer. Four Central Texas towns made the top 11 list, with Bruceville-Eddy ranking 11th with 684 stops per officer and 1,336 citations issued in 2020. Buckholts came in 10th with 741 stops per officer and 1,341 citations issued.

Lott took second place with 1,192 stops per officer and 2,475 citations issued, while Rosebud topped the list with 1,385 stops per officer, although they only issued 1,001 citations in 2020. The data suggests that these towns are relying heavily on speeding tickets as a source of revenue, with some towns issuing more citations than they have residents.

The use of speed traps has been a controversial issue, with some arguing that they are a necessary measure to ensure public safety, while others see them as a way for towns to generate revenue without providing adequate services to residents. Driving apps like Waze have even begun to alert drivers when they are over the speed limit, potentially helping them avoid tickets.

The data analysis also highlighted other towns in Texas that are known for their aggressive speed traps, including Luling, Martindale, and Cibolo. These towns have been criticized for their heavy-handed approach to enforcing speed limits, with some drivers reporting being pulled over for minor infractions or being ticketed for speeds that are only slightly above the limit.

The use of speed traps has been a longstanding issue in Texas, with some towns relying heavily on the revenue generated from speeding tickets. In 2019, the Texas Legislature passed a bill that aimed to reduce the number of speed traps in the state, but it was vetoed by Governor Greg Abbott.

Despite the controversy surrounding speed traps, they remain a common practice in many Texas towns. Drivers are advised to be aware of their surroundings and to drive cautiously, especially in areas known for aggressive speed traps.

In conclusion, the data analysis by the Houston Chronicle highlights the extent to which some Texas towns are relying on speeding tickets as a source of revenue. While the use of speed traps may be a necessary measure to ensure public safety, it is important for towns to balance their need for revenue with the rights of drivers. Drivers should be aware of their surroundings and drive cautiously, especially in areas known for aggressive speed traps.
