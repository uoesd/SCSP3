Suez Canal Blockage Costs Global Economy $400 Million Per Hour as Cargo Ship Remains Stuck

A massive cargo ship named the Ever Given has been blocking the Suez Canal since early Tuesday, causing significant economic disruption and costing the global economy an estimated $400 million per hour in delayed goods, according to Lloyd's List. The Suez Canal is a crucial trade route that connects Europe to Asia, with an average of $9.7 billion worth of cargo goods passing through it daily.

The Ever Given, owned by Japanese company Shoei Kisen, has been lodged in the canal for several days, blocking the passage of approximately 93 vessels daily, which has resulted in nearly 300 vessels being blocked so far. The ship's owner hopes to free the vessel by Saturday, but the blockage has already exacerbated the strained global supply chain, which has been affected by the pandemic.

The blockage has forced some ships to reroute around Africa's southern tip, a longer, more dangerous, and costly journey. Efforts to dislodge the ship have been ongoing, including clearing sand and mud and using tugboats. The situation highlights the vulnerability of global supply chains and the importance of the Suez Canal as a critical trade route.

The Suez Canal is a vital artery for global trade, with over 17,000 ships passing through it every year. The blockage has caused a backlog of ships waiting to pass through the canal, which could take days or even weeks to clear. The delay has already caused a spike in oil prices and disrupted the supply of essential goods, including food and medicine.

The Ever Given's predicament has also raised concerns about the safety of the crew, who have been on board the ship for several days. The ship's owner has assured that the crew is safe and that efforts are being made to ensure their well-being.

The blockage of the Suez Canal has sent ripples through the global economy, highlighting the interconnectedness of trade routes and the vulnerability of supply chains. As the world continues to grapple with the pandemic, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of diversifying trade routes and investing in infrastructure to mitigate against such disruptions.

In conclusion, the blockage of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given has caused significant economic disruption, costing the global economy millions of dollars per hour in delayed goods. The incident highlights the importance of the Suez Canal as a critical trade route and the need for diversified trade routes and robust infrastructure to mitigate against such disruptions.
