Suez Canal Blockage: Nigeria Braces for Increased Prices and Delays in Shipping

The recent blockage of the Suez Canal by the cargo ship 'The Ever Given' has sent shockwaves through the global trade industry, with Nigeria being no exception. The canal, which is a crucial link for trade between Asia and Europe, has been blocked since March 25th, affecting around 12% of global trade. The incident could not have come at a worse time, as the world is still grappling with the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

According to Okojie Larry, Vice President and Head of Trade & Marine Operations at Gladius Commodities Limited, "The blockage could take days or weeks to clear, costing companies and leading to higher freight costs." He predicts that the incident will lead to increased prices for various goods in Nigeria, as the country is heavily reliant on imports. "Nigeria risks facing increased prices for goods due to delays in shipping," he said.

The efforts to free the ship have been extensive, with around 27,000 cubic meters of sand being removed. However, despite the ship being partially refloated, normal traffic in the Suez Canal has yet to resume, affecting crude oil conveyance and causing potential demurrage and insurance claims.

Private Oil Market Trader, Opeoluwa Dapo-Thomas, sees the impact on Nigeria as negligible, but highlights the increased costs for ship owners and insurance companies. "The blockage will have a negligible impact on Nigeria, but it will increase costs for ship owners and insurance companies," he said.

Nigerian businesses are already incurring demurrages due to the blockage, with implications for market liquidity. The blockage has also raised concerns about the resilience of global supply chains, which are still recovering from the disruptions caused by the pandemic.

In conclusion, the blockage of the Suez Canal has sent a ripple effect through the global trade industry, with Nigeria being no exception. The incident highlights the fragility of global supply chains and the need for contingency plans to mitigate against such disruptions. As the world waits for the blockage to be cleared, Nigerian businesses must brace themselves for increased prices and delays in shipping.
