Afghans Seek UK Help After Kabul Airport Attack, Family of British Victim Feels 'Ignored'

Relatives of Afghans injured or killed in the Kabul airport attack are seeking help from the British government to bring their loved ones to the UK, as the aftermath of the devastating attack continues to unfold. Among those seeking help are the family of Musa Popal, a 60-year-old British shopkeeper who was killed in the attack.

"We feel ignored by the Foreign Office," said Zohra Popal, daughter of Musa Popal. "My father was a British citizen and he was killed in this attack. We want to know what the government is going to do to help us."

Musa Popal had British and Afghan citizenship and had moved to the UK in 1999. His family is now seeking assistance to bring his body back to the UK for burial.

Another family affected by the attack is that of Muhammad Raza, a 23-month-old baby who was critically injured in the attack. Basbibi, Muhammad's mother, expressed her concern for her son's well-being. "I am worried about my son's health. He is still in Kabul and needs medical attention. I want him to be brought to the UK for treatment," she said.

The Ministry of Defence has stated that only UK nationals and Afghans already processed would be airlifted, leaving many families in limbo. Imran Niazi, a friend of Mohammad Niazi, another Londoner who was killed in the attack along with his wife and two of their children, criticized the government's response. "It's not good enough. The government needs to do more to help these families," he said.

Despite the challenges, there have been some positive developments. A baby girl named Havva was born on an RAF evacuation flight to Birmingham, bringing a glimmer of hope in the midst of tragedy. The British government has also airlifted 15,000 people from Kabul, including 2,200 children.

The attack, which killed an estimated 170 people and 13 US military personnel, has left a trail of devastation and heartbreak. As the dust settles, the families of those affected are struggling to come to terms with their loss.

Zohra Popal expressed her deep concern for her mother's safety in Afghanistan. "My mother is still in Kabul and I am worried about her safety. I want her to be brought to the UK as soon as possible," she said.

The attack has highlighted the plight of Afghans who have been caught in the crossfire of conflict for decades. As the international community grapples with how to respond, the families of those affected are left to pick up the pieces and try to rebuild their lives.

In the midst of the tragedy, there have been calls for greater support for those affected. "The government needs to do more to help these families," said Imran Niazi. "They have lost everything and are struggling to cope."

As the situation in Kabul continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the impact of this attack will be felt for a long time to come. The families of those affected are hoping that the British government will do more to help them in their time of need.
