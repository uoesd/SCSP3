Major Banks Deliver $1,400 Stimulus Checks, IRS Prioritizes Payments Amid Ongoing Pandemic Struggles

Major banks in the United States began delivering $1,400 stimulus checks in March, providing much-needed relief to households affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), over 165 million payments totaling approximately $388 billion have been delivered, with an official payment date of May 12 for the latest round.

The IRS has prioritized individuals who filed their 2019 or 2020 tax returns and has vetted payment data for government benefit recipients, including Social Security beneficiaries. "We're working hard to get these payments out as quickly as possible to those who need them most," said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig.

More than 460,000 "plus-up" payments were sent to individuals owed more than initially received, with another 500,000 payments to recent tax filers. Approximately half of the new payments were sent via direct deposit and the other half through mail via checks or pre-paid debit cards.

Lawmakers are considering a fourth round of payments as 38% of people report their household income remains impacted by the pandemic. "The economic impact of the pandemic continues to be felt by many Americans, and we must continue to provide support to those who need it most," said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden.

The IRS reopened the "Get My Payment" website for tracking the $1,400 checks, showing various statuses from processed payments to needing more information. "We encourage people to check the website for updates on their payment status," said Rettig.

However, issues like unchanged addresses or bank information can affect payment delivery. "If the IRS has outdated bank account information, it may cause delays," said Charlie Wise, head of global research and consulting at TransUnion. "It's important for individuals to ensure their information is up to date to avoid any issues."

Pre-paid debit cards for stimulus payments will not be reloaded; a new card or alternative payment method will be issued. If the IRS has outdated bank account information, it may cause delays, but returned funds will lead to a mailed check or pre-paid debit card.

The IRS encourages filing 2020 tax returns with current information to ensure accurate and timely payment delivery. "We urge people to file their taxes as soon as possible to ensure they receive their payment quickly and correctly," said Rettig.

As the pandemic continues to affect households across the country, the stimulus checks provide a much-needed lifeline. "These payments are a vital part of our efforts to support Americans during this difficult time," said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

In conclusion, the delivery of $1,400 stimulus checks by major banks and the IRS represents a significant step in providing financial relief to those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. With continued efforts to prioritize payments and improve delivery methods, the government remains committed to supporting households during this challenging period.
