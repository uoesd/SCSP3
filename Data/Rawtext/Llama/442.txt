Prince Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, to Join Global Citizen Live Event in NYC for Vaccine Equity Advocacy

New York, September 10, 2022 - Global Citizen, an international advocacy organization, today announced that Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will join the Global Citizen Live event in New York City on September 25, 2022, to advocate for vaccine equity in the fight against COVID-19. The event is part of a 24-hour global broadcast from Central Park, which aims to promote global vaccine equity and combat the ongoing pandemic.

The Global Citizen Live campaign calls on G7 countries and the European Union to share 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses and waive vaccine intellectual property rights. The campaign also urges Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna to share their mRNA technology with the World Health Organization (WHO)-backed hub in South Africa. This technology sharing would enable the production of vaccines in low-income countries, ensuring that access to vaccines is not limited by geography.

Prince Harry and Meghan have been long-time advocates for vaccine equity. They previously co-chaired the VAX LIVE event and wrote an open letter to Big Pharma, emphasizing that access to the vaccine should be a basic right. They also led a fundraising effort for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, raising $3.5 million for COVAX to distribute vaccines to low-income countries.

The initiative addresses the ongoing issue of vaccine equity amid the spread of coronavirus variants and vaccine hoarding by rich countries. The event will feature appearances by health and global leaders, activists, and artists to promote environmental protection and poverty defeat. It aims to pressure wealthy nations on climate change commitment, promote emissions reduction by businesses, and tackle global hunger with a $6 billion contribution.

"We are thrilled to have Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, join us for Global Citizen Live," said Hugh Evans, CEO of Global Citizen. "Their commitment to vaccine equity and their leadership in the fight against COVID-19 have been inspiring. We are proud to have them as part of our efforts to ensure that everyone, everywhere has access to the vaccines they need to protect themselves and their communities."

The Global Citizen Live event will be broadcast live on television and digital platforms across the globe, reaching an estimated audience of over 1 billion people. The event will feature performances by world-renowned artists, including Jennifer Lopez, Billy Joel, and Green Day, among others.

"We are honored to be a part of Global Citizen Live and to continue our work towards vaccine equity," said Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex. "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of global cooperation and the need for equitable access to healthcare. We must work together to ensure that everyone, regardless of their background or location, has access to the vaccines they need to protect themselves and their communities."

Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex, added, "We are proud to join Global Citizen Live and to use our voices to advocate for vaccine equity. The pandemic has shown us that we are all connected and that we must work together to overcome global challenges. We urge everyone to join us in this effort and to demand that world leaders take action to ensure that everyone has access to the vaccines they need."
