Harris Urges Truth-Telling on Racism, Praises Biden's Stance on White Supremacy

Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized the importance of acknowledging the history of racism in America during an interview on ABC's 'Good Morning America' with co-anchors George Stephanopoulos and Robin Roberts. When asked about GOP Sen. Tim Scott's claim that America is not a racist country, Harris agreed but urged for truth-telling about racism's historical and present impact.

"We have to acknowledge the history of racism in this country and its ongoing impacts today," Harris said. "We can't sugarcoat it. We have to tell the truth."

Harris praised President Joe Biden for labeling white supremacy as terrorism and the most lethal threat to the U.S. "President Biden has been clear-eyed about the threat of white supremacy and its impact on our country," she said. "We must continue to confront this threat head-on and work towards a more just and equitable society."

The Vice President also discussed the Biden administration's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, highlighting efforts to work in a bipartisan manner. However, she did not specify how much the administration is willing to compromise. "We're committed to working with both parties to pass a comprehensive infrastructure bill that benefits all Americans," Harris said.

Harris also clarified her role in the infrastructure proposal, emphasizing that she is leading the effort to expand broadband internet access, not the entire initiative. "My focus is on ensuring that every American has access to reliable and affordable high-speed internet," she said.

In addition to her work on infrastructure, Harris is also tasked with leading the diplomatic effort to address migration from Central America. She emphasized the need for long-term investment and cooperation with world leaders to address the reasons behind migration from the region.

"We must address the root causes of migration, including poverty, violence, and political instability," Harris said. "This requires a sustained commitment to investing in the region and working with our international partners to create conditions that allow people to thrive in their home countries."

Harris's comments come as the Biden administration faces pressure to address the surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. The administration has announced plans to increase aid to Central America and work with regional leaders to address the crisis.

Despite the challenges ahead, Harris expressed optimism about the future of the country. "I believe in the resilience and strength of the American people," she said. "If we work together and tell the truth about our history and our present, we can overcome any obstacle and build a better future for all."

In conclusion, Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized the importance of acknowledging the history of racism in America and praised President Biden's stance on white supremacy. She also discussed the administration's infrastructure plan and her role in expanding broadband internet access, as well as the diplomatic effort to address migration from Central America. Harris expressed optimism about the future of the country and stressed the need for unity through truth and accountability.
