QAnon Theorists Suggest Facebook Outage is Sign of 'Blackout' and Mass Arrests

A major Facebook outage that affected billions of users and caused a roughly 4.9 percent decrease in the company's stock value has sparked speculation among QAnon conspiracy theorists that it could be a sign of the predicted "Blackout" signaling mass arrests of global elites.

The outage, which lasted for six hours, affected Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and erased about $40 billion from Facebook's market cap. Facebook attributed the outage to internal system issues and assured no user data was compromised.

However, QAnon followers, including John Sabal (QAnon John) and Ron Watkins, have taken to social media to suggest otherwise. John Sabal highlighted a 4Chan post that hinted at a coming global internet outage, which appeared minutes after the Facebook platforms went offline.

Ron Watkins suggested the outage could be linked to Facebook's reaction to whistleblower Frances Haugen's allegations. Watkins, who has a substantial Telegram following, plans to attend the 'For God and Country: Patriot Double Down' convention, which is expected to host QAnon followers and Republican politicians who dispute the 2020 Presidential Election results.

"The timing of this outage is very suspicious," said John Sabal in a Telegram post. "Could it be that the 'Blackout' has finally arrived? Are the mass arrests of global elites about to begin?"

Sabal's post was met with a mix of excitement and skepticism from his followers. Some believed that the outage was indeed a sign of the predicted "Blackout," while others were more cautious, suggesting that it could be a routine technical issue.

Ron Watkins, who has been involved in the QAnon movement for several years, also weighed in on the outage. "I don't think this is a coincidence," he said in a Telegram post. "Facebook has been under a lot of pressure lately, and this outage could be their way of trying to silence us."

Watkins' post sparked a lively discussion among his followers, with some suggesting that the outage could be a sign of a larger conspiracy involving the government and big tech.

Despite the speculation, Facebook has maintained that the outage was caused by internal system issues and that no user data was compromised. However, the incident has highlighted the fragility of the global internet infrastructure and the potential for widespread disruption.

The QAnon movement, which began in 2017, has been associated with a range of conspiracy theories, including the idea that there is a secret group of people working to take down a cabal of powerful elites who are responsible for various evil acts. The movement has been linked to violent incidents and hate groups, and has been denounced by many as a dangerous and harmful conspiracy theory.

In conclusion, while the Facebook outage may have been a routine technical issue, it has sparked a flurry of speculation among QAnon followers who believe it could be a sign of the predicted "Blackout" and mass arrests of global elites. While there is no evidence to support these claims, the incident highlights the enduring appeal of conspiracy theories and the potential for widespread disruption in the digital age.
