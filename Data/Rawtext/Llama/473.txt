The Naming of Lilibet: A Contradiction in the Fight Against Racism?

The birth of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's second child, Lilibet "Lili" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, has brought joy to many, but it has also raised questions about the couple's stance on the royal institution and traditions. The name "Lilibet" is a nod to Queen Elizabeth II, whose family nickname is Lilibet, and "Diana" is a tribute to Princess Diana. While the name is a touching tribute to the royal family, it raises questions about Harry and Meghan's criticism of the institution they have accused of racial abuse.

In their interview with Oprah, Meghan and Harry detailed their struggles with racism within the Royal Family, which they claimed led to their decision to step back from their royal duties. They cited a lack of support and concerns over mental health as additional reasons for their departure. However, the choice of their child's name seems to contradict their stance against the royal institution and traditions.

It is worth noting that the royal family has a history of naming children after their ancestors, and it is not uncommon for members of the royal family to be named after previous monarchs. However, in light of Meghan and Harry's criticisms of the royal family, the choice of "Lilibet" and "Diana" sends a mixed message. It appears to be a gesture of reconciliation with the royal family, which raises questions about the couple's commitment to fighting against racism and the monarchy.

It is important to recognize that the fight against racism and the monarchy requires more than just personal reconciliation with the family. Real change requires a systemic overhaul of the institution and its traditions, which have historically perpetuated racism and discrimination. While it is understandable that Meghan and Harry may want to maintain a connection to their family, it is crucial that they do not prioritize personal relationships over the fight for justice and equality.

It is also important to note that Meghan and Harry should not be seen as heroes in the anti-racism movement. They are not leaders in the fight against racism, but rather family members seeking reconciliation with the royal family. While their experiences with racism within the royal family are valid, their decision to name their child after members of the royal family they have accused of racial abuse undermines their credibility in the fight against racism.

In conclusion, the naming of Lilibet "Lili" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor raises questions about Meghan and Harry's stance on the royal institution and traditions. While the name is a touching tribute to the royal family, it appears to contradict their criticism of the institution they have accused of racial abuse. The fight against racism and the monarchy requires more than just personal reconciliation with the family, and it is crucial that Meghan and Harry do not prioritize personal relationships over the fight for justice and equality.
