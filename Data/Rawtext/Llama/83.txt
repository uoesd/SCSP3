Tennessee Man Pleads Guilty to Minor Charge in Capitol Riot

Bryan Wayne Ivey, a Tennessee man, has pleaded guilty to a minor protest-related charge stemming from the January 6 Capitol riot. Ivey, who was arrested on March 4 in Tennessee, admitted to entering restricted areas of the Capitol and pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating, or picketing inside Capitol grounds.

According to Assistant U.S. Attorney for D.C. Leslie Goemaat, Ivey agreed to pay $500 in restitution to the United States and could face prison time, a fine, or probation. Ivey was originally charged with four counts related to the riot, but the other charges were dropped as part of his plea deal.

A tipster identified Ivey from social media photos, leading to his arrest. Evidence suggested that Ivey did not break a window himself but watched another protester do so. Ivey traveled to Washington, D.C., with his wife and brother, who did not enter the Capitol.

Ivey's attorney, Robert David Baker, a Middle Tennessee public defender, plans to present mitigating factors at the sentencing hearing, which is scheduled for September 28. At the hearing, Ivey could face up to six months in prison, a $5,000 fine, and/or up to one year of probation.

Ivey is the first defendant with Tennessee ties to plead guilty in connection with the January 6 riot. His guilty plea comes as a number of other defendants have also pleaded guilty to various charges related to the riot.

In a statement, Goemaat emphasized the importance of holding those responsible for the riot accountable. "The actions of those who participated in the riot were unacceptable and will not be tolerated," she said. "We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that those who broke the law are held accountable for their actions."

Baker declined to comment on the specifics of Ivey's case but expressed gratitude for the opportunity to present mitigating factors at the sentencing hearing. "We appreciate the opportunity to present our client's side of the story and hope that the court will take all relevant factors into account when determining his sentence," he said.

The guilty plea and sentencing hearing come as the nation continues to grapple with the aftermath of the January 6 riot, which left several people injured and caused significant damage to the Capitol building. The incident has sparked a number of investigations and legal proceedings, with many defendants facing charges related to the riot.
