Gabby Petito's Mother Shocked by Hulu Documentary Recommendation: 'It's Like Reliving the Nightmare'

Nichole Schmidt, the mother of Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old YouTuber who was found dead in a Wyoming campground, has expressed her shock and pain after Hulu recommended a documentary about her daughter's death. Schmidt took to Twitter to share her feelings, highlighting the surreal experience of seeing her daughter's story as a recommended show.

"I can't believe Hulu recommended a documentary about Gabby's death. It's like reliving the nightmare all over again," Schmidt tweeted. "I'm still in disbelief that my daughter is gone. It's been three months since she was found, and it feels like an eternity since I've seen her smile."

Gabby Petito was found dead on September 19, days after being reported missing. The Teton County coroner, Dr. Brent Blue, determined that she died from strangulation, and her death was predicted to be three to four weeks before her body was found.

Schmidt's tweet sparked a wave of support and prayers from social media users, who acknowledged Gabby's impact worldwide. "My heart goes out to you and your family, Nichole. Gabby's story has touched so many lives, and she will never be forgotten," one user tweeted.

As the investigation into Gabby's death continues, criminologists and homicide investigators are speculating on the possibility of finding a suicide note or confession within Brian Laundrie's notebook. Laundrie, who was identified as a person of interest in Gabby's death, was found dead in Florida, with the cause of death still unknown and awaiting further tests by an anthropologist.

"It's not uncommon for individuals in these situations to leave behind some kind of note or confession," said Casey Jordan, a criminologist. "It's possible that Laundrie may have left behind something that could shed light on what happened to Gabby."

Paul Belli, a former homicide investigator and current president of the International Homicide Investigations Association, agrees. "In cases like this, it's not uncommon for the perpetrator to leave behind some kind of evidence that could implicate them," he said. "It's possible that Laundrie's notebook could contain information that could help investigators piece together what happened to Gabby."

However, Belli also notes that Laundrie had the opportunity to disturb evidence, complicating the investigation into Gabby's death. "It's possible that Laundrie may have tried to cover his tracks, which could make it more difficult for investigators to determine what happened," he said.

As the investigation continues, Gabby's family and friends are left to grieve and remember the 22-year-old YouTuber who touched so many lives. "Gabby was a shining light, and her spirit will live on through the countless people she inspired," Schmidt said. "I'm so grateful for the outpouring of support and love we've received. It's a reminder that Gabby's legacy will never fade."
