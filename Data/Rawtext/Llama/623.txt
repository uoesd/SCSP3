Vice President Kamala Harris Visits NASA Goddard, Emphasizes Climate Action and the Importance of Space Exploration

On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris visited NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, where she highlighted the critical role that space exploration plays in addressing the climate crisis. During her visit, Harris emphasized the extensive potential of space activity in climate action, education, economic growth, innovation, inspiration, security, and strength.

Harris' visit coincided with the release of the first images from Landsat 9, a joint mission between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) that will continue the legacy of monitoring Earth's land surfaces. The images, taken on October 31, show significant locations and contribute to nearly 50 years of Earth observation. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson stated, "Landsat 9 is a critical component in our efforts to understand and address the impacts of climate change."

The Vice President also met with scientists and engineers to discuss NASA's role in tackling climate challenges. NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D., joined Harris and Nelson in highlighting the NOAA-NASA partnership's contributions to climate and weather monitoring. Spinrad emphasized the importance of climate data from NASA, NOAA, and USGS in understanding extreme weather and climate events.

During her visit, Harris operated a robotic arm for future Landsat 7 missions and visited the under-construction PACE mission for ocean health assessment. Assistant Secretary for Water and Science at the Department of the Interior Tanya Trujillo expressed her excitement about the potential of these missions, saying, "The data collected by these missions will be invaluable in our efforts to protect our planet and ensure a sustainable future."

The Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to addressing the climate crisis was underscored during the visit. Harris emphasized that the Administration is committed to using all tools at its disposal, including space exploration, to combat the climate crisis. A new Earth Venture Mission-3 (EVM-3), named INCUS, was also discussed, which aims to improve our understanding of storm development.

In conclusion, Vice President Kamala Harris' visit to NASA Goddard highlighted the critical role that space exploration plays in addressing the climate crisis. The release of the first Landsat 9 images and the discussion of future missions like INCUS demonstrate the Administration's commitment to using all tools at its disposal to protect our planet and ensure a sustainable future.
