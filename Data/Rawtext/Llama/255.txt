FDA Authorizes Emergency Use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Aged 5-11

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children aged 5 through 11, the agency announced today. This authorization comes after a thorough evaluation of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in this age group.

"We are pleased to announce that the FDA has authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children aged 5-11," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. "This authorization is a critical step in our efforts to protect children from the COVID-19 pandemic and follows a rigorous evaluation of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in this age group."

The FDA's authorization is based on a study that demonstrated the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 in children aged 5-11. The study found that the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in this age group. The safety of the vaccine was also studied in approximately 3,100 children aged 5-11, and no serious side effects were detected.

"We are confident in the safety and effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children aged 5-11," said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "Our evaluation process was rigorous and transparent, and we are committed to continuously monitoring the safety of this vaccine."

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children aged 5-11 is administered as a two-dose series with a lower dose than that for ages 12 and up. The vaccine is formulated using Tris buffer, which has been authorized to improve stability and storage conditions.

The authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children aged 5-11 comes at a critical time, as COVID-19 cases in children in this age group make up 39% of cases in those younger than 18 in the U.S.

"We recognize the urgent need for a vaccine for children aged 5-11, and we are committed to working with our partners to ensure that this vaccine is available to those who need it most," said Dr. Woodcock.

The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will discuss further recommendations for the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in children aged 5-11 next week.

The FDA and CDC have systems in place for continual safety monitoring of the COVID-19 vaccine, including evaluations of myocarditis and pericarditis among other safety measures. Pfizer Inc. has also updated its safety monitoring plan to include these evaluations.

"We are committed to ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine, and we will continue to monitor its safety and effectiveness in real-time," said Dr. Marks.

In conclusion, the FDA's authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children aged 5-11 is a significant step forward in the fight against COVID-19. The vaccine has been found to be safe and effective in this age group, and its availability will help to protect children from the pandemic. The FDA and CDC will continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and work to ensure that it is available to those who need it most.
