Tragedy on Set: Union Members Walked Out Hours Before Fatal Incident Involving Alec Baldwin

In a tragic turn of events, a fatal incident involving actor Alec Baldwin occurred on the set of the movie "Rust" just hours after union members walked out due to safety concerns. The walkout was prompted by concerns over poor gun safety, hotels, COVID protocols, and an overall lack of safety, according to a text message obtained by The Post.

The crew had reportedly written resignation letters citing various safety concerns and lack of payment, and cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who tragically died in the incident, was among the few who remained on set. Hutchins had been vocal about improving safety conditions before her death.

After the walkout, non-union members were brought in to replace the resigning crew. The prop gun involved in the incident had misfired on multiple occasions prior to the fatal shooting, and the prop master who handled the gun was recently hired amid protests over set conditions.

Santa Fe police have yet to respond to inquiries about the incident, leaving many questions unanswered. This tragic event highlights the importance of prioritizing safety on set and the potential consequences of neglecting such concerns.

The incident has sent shockwaves through the film industry, with many calling for better safety protocols and accountability. The death of Halyna Hutchins is a devastating reminder of the risks involved in film production and the need for adequate safety measures to protect crew members.

As the investigation into the incident continues, it is clear that the fatal shooting on the set of "Rust" was a preventable tragedy. The walkout by union members and the concerns raised by Hutchins and others highlight the need for better safety protocols and a culture of accountability in the film industry.

In the wake of this tragedy, it is crucial that the industry takes a hard look at its safety protocols and ensures that crew members are protected from preventable harm. The memory of Halyna Hutchins and the safety of all crew members depend on it.
