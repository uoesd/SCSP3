Gen. Colin Powell Praises Veterans of Desert Storm, Recalls Operation's Success

Washington, D.C. - In a recent interview, retired General and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell praised the veterans of Operation Desert Storm, recalling their dedication, readiness, and sense of family during the conflict.

"The troops were magnificent," Powell said. "They were young, they were eager, they were ready to do their job, and they did it superbly well."

Powell, who served as the Commander of the U.S. Army Forces Command during Operation Desert Storm, remembered the heartwarming and humorous moments he shared with soldiers during his visits downrange.

"I'll never forget the time I visited a group of soldiers huddled around a campfire in the middle of the desert," Powell recalled. "They were roasting marshmallows and telling jokes. It was a moment of levity in the midst of a very serious operation."

Powell also highlighted the cautious approach taken by President George H.W. Bush, who sought a political solution before resorting to military action.

"President Bush was a wise leader who understood the importance of using military force as a last resort," Powell said. "He gave us the time and resources we needed to prepare for the operation, and his leadership was instrumental in our success."

Powell's doctrine, which advocates for war as a last resort and the strategic use of military force, played a pivotal role in the success of Operation Desert Storm.

"We knew that airpower would be key in softening the battlefield," Powell said. "We used it effectively at the beginning of the conflict, and it gave us a significant advantage."

Powell outlined the strategic operations of the ground war, highlighting the swift success of the U.S. and coalition forces.

"The ground war was a textbook example of combined arms operations," Powell said. "We used armor, infantry, artillery, and airpower in concert to achieve our objectives. It was a beautiful thing to watch."

The use of advanced technology and media coverage during Desert Storm significantly impacted American public perception.

"The Gulf War was the first conflict to be heavily covered by the media," Powell said. "It brought the war into people's living rooms, and it helped to build support for our troops and our mission."

Powell acknowledged the crucial roles of logisticians, Merchant Marines, and air transportation in the success of Desert Storm.

"We couldn't have done it without the hard work and dedication of our logisticians and transportation personnel," Powell said. "They ensured that our troops had the supplies and equipment they needed to succeed."

In conclusion, Gen. Colin Powell praised the veterans of Operation Desert Storm, highlighting their bravery, dedication, and sense of family. He also emphasized the importance of careful planning, strategic use of military force, and the support of logisticians and transportation personnel in the success of the operation.

"Desert Storm was a defining moment in our nation's history," Powell said. "I'm proud of what we accomplished, and I'll always be grateful to the men and women who served with me."
