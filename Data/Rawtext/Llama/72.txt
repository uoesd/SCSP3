House Panel Issues Subpoenas to Proud Boys, Oath Keepers in Jan. 6 Capitol Riot Probe

The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot has issued subpoenas to the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, and their leaders Henry 'Enrique' Tarrio and Elmer Stewart Rhodes, Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) announced on Wednesday. The subpoenas are part of the committee's effort to understand how violence erupted at the Capitol and the preparations leading up to the attack, which temporarily halted the confirmation of President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory.

The subpoenas are the latest in a series of moves by the bipartisan panel to probe the factors and events that precipitated the riot, following months of false claims by former President Donald Trump that the 2020 election was rigged against him. Prosecutors have noted coordination between Capitol riot defendants, the Proud Boys, and the Oath Keepers, with a subpoena referencing a "conspiracy among at least 18 Oath Keepers" to storm the Capitol with paramilitary gear and weapons.

Rhodes was indirectly mentioned in an indictment for being in direct contact with indicted Oath Keepers before, during, and after the Capitol attack. Prior to Jan. 6, Rhodes allegedly made remarks suggesting the Oath Keepers were prepared to use violence to ensure their preferred election outcome. The subpoenas also target 1st Amendment Praetorian, another organization involved with the events leading up to the Jan. 6 attack.

"The Select Committee is committed to investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol and ensuring that those responsible are held accountable," Chairman Thompson said in a statement. "These subpoenas are an important step in our investigation as we work to understand the planning, coordination, and execution of the violent attack on our democracy."

The committee has already issued dozens of other subpoenas for documents and testimony related to the Jan. 6 events, and is expected to continue its investigation in the coming weeks and months.
