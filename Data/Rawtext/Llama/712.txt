Tragedy Strikes Austin-East Magnet High School: Student Killed, Officer Injured in Officer-Involved Shooting

Knoxville, Tennessee - A tragic incident has occurred at Austin-East Magnet High School, where a student was killed and a police officer was injured during an encounter. The school has canceled classes for two days as a result.

According to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), officers responded to a call of a potentially armed person, identified as 17-year-old student Anthony J. Thompson Jr., in the school bathroom. Following a struggle, Thompson's gun fired, and an officer returned fire, resulting in Thompson's death at the scene.

"This is an officer-involved shooting at a school, not a school shooting," emphasized TBI Director David Rausch.

The injured officer, Adam Wilson, was not struck by gunfire from Thompson, based on preliminary findings from the TBI.

"We are deeply saddened by the loss of life and the injury of one of our officers," said Eve Thomas, Chief of the Knoxville Police Department. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and the community during this difficult time."

The TBI is continuing its investigation, and the findings will be shared with the local District Attorney.

"We will do everything in our power to ensure that the community is safe and that those responsible are held accountable," said Mayor Indya Kincannon. "We must work together to stop the violence and ensure that our schools are safe places for our children to learn and grow."

Austin-East Magnet High School is a Title 1 school with a performing arts focus. The school has experienced significant gun violence, losing four students in the last few months.

"We are heartbroken by the loss of life and the impact it has had on our school community," said Bob Thomas, Superintendent of Knox County Schools. "We will do everything in our power to support our students, teachers, and staff during this difficult time."

The Knoxville Fire Department has trained for similar incidents and described their response as successful.

"We are grateful for the quick response and professionalism of our first responders," said Captain Corcoran of the Knoxville Fire Department. "We will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to ensure the safety of our community."

"We are grateful for the outpouring of support from our community," said Mayor Kincannon. "We will continue to work together to ensure that our schools are safe and that our children have the support they need to succeed."

The incident is a reminder of the importance of school safety and the need for communities to come together to prevent violence.
