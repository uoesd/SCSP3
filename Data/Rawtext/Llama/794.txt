Stimulus Check Update: 161 Million Payments Distributed, Some May Need to Be Returned

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has distributed over 161 million third stimulus check payments, including "plus-up" payments, to eligible recipients. However, some of these payments may have been made in error or exceeded the intended amount, and recipients may be required to return the money.

The process for returning stimulus money depends on the payment method used. Recipients who received a paper check can simply return the check to the IRS by writing "VOID" on the back and including an explanation. Those who received their payment via direct deposit can contact their bank to reverse the transaction. If the payment was made to an EIP card, recipients can use the card to make a payment to the US Treasury or return the card to the IRS with an explanation.

It's important to note that income cutoffs for the third stimulus check are $80,000 for individuals, $120,000 for heads of household, and $160,000 for married couples filing jointly. If a recipient's income increased in 2020, they may not have to return payments received before filing their taxes.

Certain groups of people are ineligible for stimulus payments, including the deceased, nonresidents without a US citizen spouse, noncitizens who file federal taxes, dependents, and recipients of duplicate payments. In the case of a deceased family member, the return of payments depends on the filer status and the tax year the IRS based the payment on.

For those who have already cashed or deposited their stimulus checks, instructions are provided for returning the money to the US Treasury and notifying the IRS. Recipients who have not yet cashed their checks can simply return them to the IRS with an explanation.

It's worth noting that those who missed out on the first or second stimulus payments can still claim them as a Recovery Credit Rebate on their 2020 taxes.

In summary, while 161 million third stimulus check payments have been distributed, some recipients may need to return their payments due to errors or overpayments. The process for returning payments varies depending on the payment method used, and certain groups of people are ineligible for stimulus payments. Recipients who have already cashed or deposited their checks can return the money to the US Treasury and notify the IRS, while those who have not yet cashed their checks can simply return them with an explanation.
