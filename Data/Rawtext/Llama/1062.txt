Gabby Petito's Van Spotted in Travel Blogger's Footage, Leading to FBI Tip

A startling discovery by travel blogger Jenn Bethune has shed new light on the Gabby Petito case. Bethune, who was on a trip to Grand Teton National Park, captured footage of a van that she later realized was the same one used by Petito and her fiancé Brian Laundrie. The footage was featured in an episode of ABC's '20/20' titled "Life on Line: The Last Days of Gabby Petito."

Bethune's footage was captured in August 2020, just days before Petito was reported missing. In an interview with '20/20,' Bethune explained that she had been filming her trip and didn't realize the significance of the van until she saw a news report about Petito's disappearance. She immediately contacted the FBI and provided them with her footage.

The episode of '20/20' explores the last days of Petito and Laundrie's lives, including the discovery of Laundrie's remains in the Carlton Reserve. The program features interviews with experts on body language, legal analysts, and former Moab police chief Jim Winder, who analyzed police body cam footage.

Winder, who retired from the Moab Police Department in 2019, spoke to '20/20' about the investigation into Petito's disappearance. "We knew that Gabby was missing, and we knew that Brian was the last person to see her," he said. "We wanted to talk to him, but he refused to cooperate."

The episode also includes an interview with Miranda Baker, who encountered Laundrie at a gas station in Moab. Baker described Laundrie as acting suspiciously and said that he left the gas station in a hurry.

Jason Jensen, a private investigator and co-founder of the Cold Case Coalition, also spoke to '20/20' about the case. Jensen, who was hired by Petito's family to investigate her disappearance, believes that Laundrie was responsible for her death. "I think Brian knew that Gabby was going to leave him, and he couldn't handle it," he said.

Mykel Hawke, a retired special forces combat veteran and survival expert, guided '20/20' through the Carlton Reserve, where Laundrie's body was found. Hawke explained that the reserve is a vast and rugged area, making it a challenging place to search for a missing person.

The program also calls attention to missing persons of color and indigenous women in the same area as Petito. According to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, there are currently over 600 missing persons cases in Wyoming, many of which are indigenous women.

'Life on Line: The Last Days of Gabby Petito' is now streaming on Hulu. The episode provides a detailed look at the investigation into Petito's disappearance and the events leading up to Laundrie's death.

In a statement to '20/20,' Petito's family expressed their gratitude to Bethune for coming forward with her footage. "We are grateful for Jenn's bravery in coming forward with her footage," they said. "We hope that this will help bring attention to the many missing persons cases in the area."

The Gabby Petito case has captured the nation's attention and has sparked a renewed interest in missing persons cases. The episode of '20/20' provides a comprehensive look at the investigation and the people involved, and serves as a reminder of the importance of coming forward with information that could help solve a crime.
