Crisis Management: Learning from the Past to Prevent Future Blockages

In the aftermath of the recent blockage in the Suez Canal, officials are taking proactive measures to prevent such incidents from happening again. The Head of the Suez Canal Authority, Osama Rabie, has announced plans to widen and deepen a stretch of the waterway to prevent future blockages. This expansion involves widening the canal by 131 feet and deepening it by 32 feet.

This move echoes the sentiment expressed by Jonathan Wackrow, a former agent of the U.S. Secret Service, who emphasizes the importance of learning from past crises to prevent their recurrence. In an interview with Forbes, Wackrow stressed that organizations must take a proactive approach to crisis management, conducting after-action reviews and implementing reforms to address vulnerabilities.

One organization that has taken this approach is Starbucks. Following a racial bias incident, the company conducted anti-bias training for its employees, demonstrating a commitment to learning from past mistakes and preventing their recurrence.

However, not all organizations have been successful in their crisis management efforts. The U.S. Secret Service, for example, has faced criticism for a perceived lack of transparency and accountability in crisis situations. In response, the Secret Service has highlighted organizational and policy changes made in response to past incidents, including better communication, clear articulation of budget needs, increased hiring, and more training.

According to Brian Glicklich, CEO of Digital Strategies, debriefing after a crisis is crucial, but it requires clear leadership support and understanding of its purpose. In the case of the Secret Service, an independent review following a White House fence-jumping incident led to 19 recommendations for improvement.

The Suez Canal blockage serves as a reminder that crises can happen unexpectedly and have far-reaching consequences. It is essential for organizations to be proactive in their crisis management efforts, learning from past incidents and implementing reforms to prevent their recurrence. By taking a proactive approach, organizations can minimize the impact of crises and protect their reputation.

In conclusion, the Suez Canal Authority's plans to widen and deepen the waterway demonstrate a commitment to learning from past crises and preventing their recurrence. Organizations can learn from this approach and take proactive steps to manage crises effectively. By implementing reforms and conducting after-action reviews, organizations can minimize the impact of crises and protect their reputation.
