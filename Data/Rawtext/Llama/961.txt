Impeachment Trial: House Managers Dominate Speaking Time, Videos Play Key Role

The second impeachment trial of former president Donald Trump has come to a close, with the Senate voting to acquit him on charges of inciting the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. The trial, which spanned more than 27 hours and over 140,000 words in the record, saw House impeachment managers speaking over 91,000 words, while Trump's legal team contributed almost 33,000 words.

Unlike Trump's first impeachment trial, the speaking time in the second trial was more evenly distributed among speakers. Rep. Jamie B. Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, spoke just over 26,000 words, while other notable speakers included Rep. David N. Cicilline, Rep. Joe Neguse, Del. Stacey Plaskett, and Trump's lawyers David Schoen, Bruce L. Castor Jr., and Michael T. van der Veen.

Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the lead impeachment manager during Trump's first trial, noted that the House managers' strategy this time around was to present a more comprehensive case against Trump. "We wanted to make sure that we presented a full and complete picture of the president's conduct, and the harm that it caused," Schiff said.

In contrast, Trump's defense team used only one-third of the time compared to the House managers during opening arguments. David Schoen, one of Trump's lawyers, explained that their strategy was to focus on the "key points" of the case, rather than trying to match the House managers' word count.

Both sides relied heavily on video presentations during their opening arguments. The House managers played clips of Trump's speeches and rallies, as well as footage of the violence at the Capitol on January 6. Trump's lawyers, meanwhile, used videos to argue that the former president's words were taken out of context and that his actions did not incite violence.

Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer spoke 1,256 words, primarily on procedural motions. Sen. Mike Lee and Sen. Patrick J. Leahy also contributed significantly to the word count, with Leahy presiding over the trial.

Videos, testimonials, and audio footage from the January 6 events were important elements of the House managers' strategy. "We wanted to make sure that the senators saw and heard the evidence for themselves, rather than just relying on written transcripts," Raskin said.

In the end, the Senate voted to acquit Trump, with 57 senators voting guilty and 43 voting not guilty. While the outcome was not what the House managers had hoped for, they remain convinced that they presented a strong case against the former president. "We believe that the evidence we presented was overwhelming, and that the president's actions were impeachable," Cicilline said.

The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump may be over, but the legacy of the event will continue to be debated and discussed for years to come.
