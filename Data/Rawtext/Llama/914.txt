Tom Brady to Teammates: Get Used to Winning, There's More to Come

Fresh off their Super Bowl LV victory, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady has a message for his teammates: get used to the feeling of winning, because it's not going away anytime soon.

Brady, who won his seventh championship and first with the Buccaneers earlier this month, left a comment on teammate Antoine Winfield Jr.'s Instagram post showcasing his new Super Bowl tattoo. "Make sure you leave some room," Brady said, hinting that there's more hardware to come.

The tattoo, which features the team's logo on the Lombardi Trophy with raised hands in prayer, is a testament to the Buccaneers' dominant performance this season. And for Brady, who at 43 became the oldest NFL player to participate in a championship game, it's a reminder that age is just a number.

Despite retirement questions, Brady plans to continue playing and could see himself on the field past 45. "Football is more than just a sport to me," he said. "It's physical, it's mental, it's emotional. I think that's why I've been able to play for so long."

Brady's commitment to the sport is unwavering, and he emphasizes the importance of teamwork. "It's never about what I do, it's really about what we do," he said. "I think that's what makes football so special."

As for walking away from the game, Brady admits it won't be easy. "It's hard to imagine a life without football," he said. "I've been playing for so long, it's just a part of who I am."

But for now, Brady and the Buccaneers are basking in the glory of their Super Bowl victory. "It's an incredible feeling, something you dream about your whole life," Brady said. "To be able to share it with my teammates, it's just unbelievable."

And as for Winfield's tattoo? "I love it," Brady said. "It's a great reminder of what we accomplished, and I'm sure it will be a conversation starter for years to come."

As the Buccaneers look ahead to next season, one thing is certain: with Brady at the helm, they'll be a force to be reckoned with. "We're not done yet," Brady said. "We've got more championships to win, and I can't wait to see what the future holds."
