Lilibet Diana's Christening: A Royal Rift?

Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, the youngest child of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, has yet to have her christening confirmed, sparking speculation and rumors within royal circles. The baby girl, named after Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Diana, was born in June 2020, and her parents announced her birth with great joy. However, the details surrounding her christening have been shrouded in mystery, with conflicting reports emerging about the possible location and date of the ceremony.

According to a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan, "The christening of Lilibet Diana will be a private affair, and the details will be kept under wraps until further notice." However, royal correspondents and commentators have been weighing in on the possible locations and dates for the ceremony. Neil Sean, NBC's royals correspondent, reported that initial plans for Lilibet's christening at St. George's Chapel in Windsor were allegedly denied by Prince William, citing that it wasn't a good idea.

Richard Fitzwilliams, a royal commentator, noted that "St. George's Chapel is a place of great historical significance for the royal family, and it would be a fitting location for Lilibet's christening. However, it's understandable that Prince William might have reservations about the ceremony being held there, given the current circumstances."

The current circumstances refer to the fact that Harry and Meghan have stepped back from their royal duties and are currently residing in California. This has led to speculation that Lilibet's christening might take place in the United States, rather than in the UK. A representative for Harry and Meghan dismissed claims about the christening plans as speculation, stating that "no decisions have been made regarding the christening of Lilibet Diana."

Archie, Lilibet's older brother, was christened at two months old, while Prince William's children had their christenings between two and three months old. It's possible that Lilibet's christening might follow a similar timeline, but given the unique circumstances surrounding Harry and Meghan's departure from royal duties, it's difficult to predict with certainty.

For those interested in learning more about Harry and Meghan's journey, the book "Finding Freedom" is a recommended read. The book provides an in-depth look at the couple's decision to step back from their royal duties and their quest for a more private life.

In conclusion, while the details surrounding Lilibet Diana's christening remain unclear, it's evident that the ceremony will be a private and intimate affair, reflecting the wishes of her parents to keep their children's lives out of the public eye. As the royal family continues to evolve and adapt to changing times, the christening of Lilibet Diana will undoubtedly be a significant moment in the history of the British monarchy.
