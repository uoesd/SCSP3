Aaron Rodgers Tests Positive for COVID-19, Will Miss Week 9 Game vs. Chiefs

Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has tested positive for COVID-19 and will miss the team's Week 9 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero. Rodgers has been placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list, and Jordan Love will start in his place.

This development comes as a surprise, as Rodgers had previously stated that he was "immunized" against COVID-19. However, sources have confirmed that Rodgers has not received any COVID-19 vaccine.

Rodgers had sought an exemption from the NFL's COVID-19 protocols based on his antibody levels, but the request was denied. He had undergone homeopathic treatment to raise his antibody levels, which the NFL, NFLPA, and infectious disease consultant did not recognize as valid protection.

As a non-vaccinated player, Rodgers is subject to various restrictions, including daily testing and mandatory mask-wearing. The NFL-NFLPA COVID protocols outline that a player can be considered fully vaccinated with one shot, provided specific antibody levels are met.

Packers coach Matt LaFleur refused to comment on Rodgers' vaccination status, directing questions to Rodgers himself. "I'm not going to get into that," LaFleur said. "That's a personal matter for Aaron, and he'll address it when he's ready."

Rodgers will not be able to rejoin the team until Nov. 13, the day before their Week 10 game against the Seattle Seahawks.

Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported that Rodgers' positive test result was not unexpected, given his non-vaccinated status and the fact that he had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive for COVID-19.

Mike Garafolo of NFL Network added that Rodgers' situation highlights the importance of following the NFL's COVID-19 protocols, which are in place to protect players, staff, and the community.

In a statement, the Packers organization expressed their support for Rodgers and emphasized the need for all players to follow the league's COVID-19 protocols. "We are disappointed that Aaron will not be able to play in Week 9, but we understand the importance of following the NFL's COVID-19 protocols," the statement read. "We will continue to support Aaron and all of our players in their efforts to stay healthy and safe during this challenging time."

The news of Rodgers' positive test result has sent shockwaves throughout the NFL community, serving as a reminder of the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19. As the league continues to navigate this unprecedented season, the health and safety of players, staff, and fans remain the top priority.
