President Biden's Plan to Combat COVID-19: A Path Forward

My fellow Americans,

Today, I stand before you to address the ongoing battle against COVID-19. The Delta variant has brought new challenges, and it's imperative that we take bold action to protect our nation's health and safety. That's why I'm announcing a comprehensive plan to combat COVID-19, focusing on vaccination mandates, increased testing, and school safety measures.

First and foremost, we must prioritize vaccination. The science is clear: vaccines are the most effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19. That's why we're requiring employers with 100+ employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or tested weekly. Major companies like United Airlines, Disney, Tyson Foods, and Fox News are already leading the way by implementing vaccination requirements.

We're also taking action to protect our healthcare workers. The federal government will require vaccinations for all workers in healthcare facilities that receive Medicare or Medicaid funding, impacting 17 million healthcare workers. This is crucial to ensuring the safety of both patients and staff.

Furthermore, we're taking steps to keep our schools safe and open. I'm calling on governors to require vaccinations for all teachers and staff, and we're working to increase testing and make it more accessible and affordable. We'll use the Defense Production Act to boost production of rapid tests, ensuring that every school has the resources they need to keep their communities safe.

We understand that the economic recovery is also a top priority. That's why we're expanding the COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan program for small businesses. This will provide critical support to those who have been hit hardest by the pandemic, ensuring that they can continue to operate and provide for their employees.

But our efforts don't stop there. We're committed to improving care for those with COVID-19, including increasing the distribution of monoclonal antibody treatments and ensuring equity in vaccine distribution. We're working tirelessly to ensure that every American has access to the care they need, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.

In conclusion, my fellow Americans, we're at a critical juncture in our fight against COVID-19. The Delta variant has presented new challenges, but we're committed to meeting them head-on. With this comprehensive plan, we'll protect our nation's health and safety, support our economic recovery, and ensure that every American has access to the care they need. Together, we'll overcome this pandemic and build a brighter future for all. Thank you, and may God bless America.
