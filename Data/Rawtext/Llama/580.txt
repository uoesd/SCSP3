Afghanistan: From Airstrikes to Withdrawal, A Timeline of Foreign Involvement

In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the US-led coalition launched airstrikes against Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan, targeting key cities such as Kabul, Kandahar, and Jalalabad. Despite the Taliban's refusal to surrender Osama Bin Laden, their defense capabilities were destroyed, paving the way for a new Afghan constitution and presidential elections in October 2004.

In the years that followed, NATO ended its combat operations in Afghanistan, transitioning the US focus to training and supporting Afghan security forces. However, the conflict took a heavy toll on the country's security forces, with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani reporting that over 45,000 members have died since 2014, a higher figure than previously known.

In a significant shift towards ending America's longest war, US President Joe Biden recently announced a final withdrawal date of 11 September 2021 for all US troops from Afghanistan. This timeline captures key moments from the initial airstrikes against Taliban and al-Qaeda to the planned full withdrawal of US forces, highlighting the long-term involvement and impact of foreign military presence in Afghanistan.

According to President Ghani, "The sacrifices of our security forces are a testament to their bravery and commitment to protecting our country. We will continue to work with our international partners to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain."

President Biden echoed these sentiments, stating, "It is time to bring our troops home. We have achieved our objectives, and it is time to move on to the next chapter in our nation's history."

The announcement of troop withdrawal marks a significant milestone in the nearly two-decade-long conflict, outlining significant political and military transitions in Afghanistan. As the US prepares to withdraw its forces, the focus shifts to the future of Afghanistan and the ability of its security forces to maintain stability and security in the region.
