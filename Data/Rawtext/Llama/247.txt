Biden Announces Sweeping Vaccine Mandates for 100 Million Americans

WASHINGTON (AP) – President Joe Biden announced a series of sweeping vaccine mandates on Thursday, aiming to combat the COVID-19 delta variant by requiring shots for up to 100 million Americans, including private-sector employees, health care workers, federal contractors, and others.

In a prime-time address from the White House, Biden emphasized the need for urgent action to curb the spread of the virus, which has seen a significant increase in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths compared to last year.

"We have the tools to combat this virus, and now it's time to use them," Biden said. "The refusal of some Americans to get vaccinated has cost all of us, and it's time for that to stop."

The new requirements will be enforced through various federal agencies, with specific penalties and guidelines for non-compliance. Employers with more than 100 workers will be required to mandate vaccines or weekly testing for their employees, affecting about 80 million Americans. Employees of the executive branch and contractors with the federal government must be vaccinated, with no testing option, affecting several million more workers.

Biden's address also included efforts to increase virus testing, support for safe school operations, and urging large venues to require vaccinations or negative tests for entry.

Gov. Henry McMaster (R-S.C.), a vocal critic of vaccine mandates, quickly denounced Biden's plan, calling it "a gross overreach of federal authority."

Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, also criticized the mandates, saying, "We believe that vaccinations should be encouraged, not mandated."

However, not all reaction was negative. The American Medical Association, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Business Roundtable expressed support for Biden's efforts to increase vaccination rates.

"We applaud President Biden's leadership in taking bold action to protect Americans from the COVID-19 pandemic," said Dr. Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association. "Vaccination is a critical tool in preventing the spread of COVID-19, and we support efforts to increase vaccination rates."

Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, defended the mandates, saying, "The president's responsibility is to protect the American people, and that's exactly what he's doing with these measures."

The new requirements come as the U.S. experiences a surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, with the delta variant accounting for the majority of new infections. Despite a high vaccination rate, the country is seeing a significant increase in cases compared to last year.

Biden acknowledged the challenges ahead but expressed confidence in the American people's ability to come together to combat the virus.

"We've faced many challenges in our history, and we've always risen to meet them," Biden said. "We will do so again, and we will defeat this virus."

The new mandates are expected to take effect in the coming weeks, with specific guidelines and penalties for non-compliance to be outlined by federal agencies in the coming days.
