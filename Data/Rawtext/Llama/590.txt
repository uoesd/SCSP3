Harris Makes History as First Female Vice President

WASHINGTON (AP) – Kamala Harris made history on Wednesday, becoming the first female Vice President of the United States and the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to hold the office.

In her remarks at the Lincoln Memorial, Harris highlighted the moment as exemplifying "American aspiration." She said, "Today, we mark a milestone in our nation's march towards a more perfect union. A union that is equitable, just, and free for all."

Harris was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, using a Bible that belonged to Thurgood Marshall, and escorted to the podium by Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman. The ceremony was attended by President Joe Biden, who had chosen Harris as his running mate in the 2020 presidential election.

Harris' inauguration is seen as a significant moment in American history, representing progress in both gender and racial equality. Lateefah Simon, a civil rights advocate and friend of Harris, said, "This moment is a testament to the power of Black women's leadership and a reminder that we are capable of achieving anything we set our minds to."

Harris' diverse background is emphasized as reflective of many Americans' stories, bringing important perspectives to the administration. Elizabeth Shelby, a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, said, "Kamala Harris' inauguration is a moment of pride for Black women across the country. She is a shining example of what we can achieve when we support and uplift each other."

Harris had served as a Senator from California before becoming vice president and had run for the presidency herself. Her historic inauguration was celebrated by members of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and others across the country.

President Joe Biden mentioned her historic election in his inaugural address, marking it as a sign of progress. Martha S. Jones, a professor of history at Johns Hopkins University, said, "Kamala Harris' vice presidency will redefine political power in America. It is a significant step towards a more inclusive and equitable society."

Harris presided over the Senate as Vice President for the first time, swearing in three new Democratic senators. Her leadership is expected to have a significant impact on the administration's policies and initiatives.

Experts believe Harris' vice presidency will stress the significance of Black women's leadership and pave the way for future generations of women of color in politics. Harris' inauguration is a symbol of hope and progress for many Americans, and her leadership is expected to have a lasting impact on the country.

In conclusion, Kamala Harris' inauguration as the first female Vice President of the United States is a historic moment that represents progress in gender and racial equality. Her diverse background and leadership are expected to have a significant impact on the administration and the country. Her inauguration is a testament to the power of Black women's leadership and a reminder that anything is possible with hard work and determination.
