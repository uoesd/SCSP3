Gabby Petito Was Last Seen Alive in Heated Argument with Brian Laundrie at Jackson Hole Restaurant, Eyewitnesses Say

Gabby Petito, the 22-year-old woman who went missing during a cross-country road trip with her boyfriend Brian Laundrie, was last seen alive in an argument involving Laundrie and staff at a restaurant in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, eyewitnesses have told Fox News Digital.

Nina Celie Angelo and Matthew England, a couple from New Orleans, were dining at Merry Piglets restaurant on August 27 when they witnessed the altercation. They reported the incident to Fox News Digital and described Laundrie's behavior as aggressive.

"We were sitting at the bar, and we noticed this guy, Brian, arguing with the staff," Angelo said. "He was being really aggressive and belligerent, and Gabby was trying to calm him down."

According to Angelo, Laundrie was arguing with the staff possibly over the bill, and he returned to the restaurant multiple times. Petito apologized for Laundrie's behavior during the incident.

Merry Piglets confirmed that Petito and Laundrie were at the restaurant on August 27 and notified the FBI. However, the restaurant manager and local law enforcement could not recall the incident, and the FBI declined to comment.

The eyewitnesses connected the incident with Petito and Laundrie after seeing Utah police bodycam video. England, a financial adviser, reported the incident to the FBI after realizing the couple in question was Petito and Laundrie.

The incident occurred approximately two weeks after a reported confrontation between Petito and Laundrie in Moab, Utah. Petito's remains were discovered at a campsite north of Jackson Hole a few weeks later, and Laundrie returned to Florida without her on September 1.

"We didn't think much of it at the time, but now that we know what happened, it's just horrific," Angelo said. "We wish we could have done something to help."

England expressed similar sentiments, saying, "It's just terrible. We had no idea that this was happening, and now we're left wondering if there was anything we could have done to prevent it."

The discovery of Petito's remains has sparked a nationwide search for Laundrie, who has been named a person of interest in her disappearance. The FBI has issued a warrant for his arrest, and authorities have been searching for him in the Carlton Reserve in Sarasota, Florida.

As the investigation into Petito's disappearance and death continues, the altercation at Merry Piglets restaurant has taken on new significance. It is the last known sighting of Petito alive, and it raises questions about Laundrie's behavior and the couple's relationship in the days leading up to her disappearance.

For Angelo and England, the incident is a haunting reminder of the tragedy that unfolded in Jackson Hole.

"It's just heartbreaking," Angelo said. "We never would have imagined that something like this could happen. We just hope that justice is served and that Gabby's family gets the closure they deserve."

The investigation into Petito's disappearance and death is ongoing, and Fox News Digital will continue to provide updates as new information becomes available.
