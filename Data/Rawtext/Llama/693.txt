Community Mourns the Loss of Tate Myre, Oxford High School Student and Athlete Who Died in School Shooting

The community of Oxford, Michigan, is mourning the loss of Tate Myre, a 16-year-old student and athlete who died in the school shooting that took place on November 30. Tate was one of the four students who died as a result of gunshot wounds during the attack.

Tate's funeral is scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday at Kensington Church in Lake Orion. The community and Tate's teammates are gathering, showing their grief and support for each other.

According to Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard, there is no video evidence suggesting a civilian or student attempted to disarm the shooter. However, Tate's actions are considered heroic, as he tried to disarm the shooter, aiming to protect fellow students.

Tate was known for his willingness to sacrifice for others. He was a star athlete in both wrestling and football, and he shifted positions on his football team for the good of the team, reflecting his nature to put others first.

"Tate was the ultimate team player," said Ross Wingert, Tate's football and wrestling coach. "He was always willing to do whatever it took to help the team succeed."

An online petition has called for renaming the Wildcat Stadium as Tate Myre Stadium in his honor. More than 75,000 people have signed the petition, showing their support for Tate's bravery.

"Tate's actions were truly heroic," said JR Laefner, a public address announcer at Oxford football games and a family friend of the Myres. "He put himself in harm's way to protect others, and that's something we should all strive to do."

Tate's teammates and coaches remember him as a selfless and kind individual who always put others before himself.

"Tate was a leader on and off the field," said Zach Line, Oxford football coach. "He was always there for his teammates, and he had a heart of gold."

Kurt Richardson, Clarkston coach, echoed Line's sentiments. "Tate was a special kid. He had a way of making everyone around him better, both on and off the field."

Tony Patritto, Rochester Adams coach, described Tate as a fierce competitor who always had a smile on his face. "Tate was a warrior on the field, but he was also a kind and caring person who always put others first," Patritto said.

Scott Merchant, Clinton Township Chippewa Valley coach, remembered Tate as a talented athlete who always gave his all. "Tate was an incredible young man who had a bright future ahead of him," Merchant said. "He will be deeply missed."

The community is rallying around the Myre family during this difficult time. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help cover funeral expenses, and local businesses are offering support in various ways.

"The outpouring of support from the community has been overwhelming," said Laefner. "It's a testament to the kind of person Tate was and the impact he had on those around him."

As the community says goodbye to Tate, they remember him as a hero who gave his life to protect others. His legacy will live on through the countless lives he touched and the bravery he showed in his final moments.

"Tate's sacrifice will never be forgotten," said Bouchard. "He will always be remembered as a hero who put others before himself."
