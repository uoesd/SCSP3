Trump Incited Capitol Riot, Showed No Remorse, Impeachment Managers Argue

WASHINGTON – House impeachment managers presented their case against former President Donald Trump on Wednesday, arguing that he incited the deadly Capitol riot on Jan. 6 and showed no remorse in its aftermath.

Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), one of the impeachment managers, said Trump's actions were "a betrayal of his oath of office" and that he "incited a violent insurrection against the government of the United States."

Throughout the day, impeachment managers presented audio and video clips that demonstrated Trump's failure to act as the riot unfolded. They showed how Trump's tweets throughout Jan. 6 urged supporters to reject electoral votes and fight, which they argued was encouragement for the riot.

One video clip played by the impeachment managers showed a group of rioters claiming they went to the Capitol at Trump's invitation, believing they were acting on his instructions. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama) informed Trump during the riot that Vice President Mike Pence had been evacuated, to which Trump allegedly replied, "Well, you gotta do what you gotta do."

Trump's tweets throughout the day were cited as further evidence of his incitement. In one tweet, he wrote, "Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done." In another, he told his supporters, "Go home and go home in peace."

However, some of Trump's tweets during the riot were deleted, and he was temporarily banned from Twitter for 12 hours, later being permanently banned.

Rep. DeGette argued that the attack was carried out for Trump, at his instructions. "He wanted to overturn the election results, and he was willing to incite violence to do it," she said.

Sen. Tuberville's conversation with Trump during the riot was also presented as evidence of Trump's lack of remorse. "I said, 'Mr. President, they've taken the vice president out of the building. They're getting ready to evacuate the Senate,'" Tuberville recalled. "He said, 'Well, you gotta do what you gotta do.'"

The impeachment managers argued that Trump's failure to take immediate action to deter the rioters and his attack on Pence in a tweet showed a lack of remorse for the violence that ensued.

In conclusion, the impeachment managers asserted that Trump's actions on Jan. 6 were a clear violation of his oath of office and that he must be held accountable for inciting the Capitol riot.

"The President of the United States incited a violent insurrection against the government of the United States," Rep. DeGette said. "He must be impeached, and he must be convicted."
