Evacuation Efforts in Afghanistan: A Promise Kept

My fellow Americans,

I stand before you today to provide an update on the ongoing efforts to evacuate American citizens, third-country civilians, Afghan allies, and vulnerable Afghans from Afghanistan. Since my last address, significant progress has been made, and I am proud to report that we have made good on our promise to help those in need.

First and foremost, I want to emphasize that the evacuation mission in Afghanistan is one of the largest and most difficult airlifts in history. It is a complex and dangerous operation, and we cannot guarantee that the final outcome will be without loss. However, I want to assure you that we are doing everything in our power to ensure the safety and well-being of all those who are being evacuated.

As of today, we have successfully evacuated over 18,000 people since July, with around 13,000 of those being evacuated since the military airlift began on August 14. These evacuees include American citizens, permanent residents, their families, SIV applicants, and other vulnerable Afghans. We are working tirelessly to process and evacuate all those who are eligible and want to leave Afghanistan.

I am proud to report that we have successfully evacuated all 204 employees of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. This is a testament to our commitment to protecting the freedom of the press and ensuring the safety of those who work tirelessly to bring us the news.

Flights in Kabul were briefly paused to process arriving evacuees, but they have since resumed. We are working in operational coordination with NATO, and our allies have been instrumental in helping us facilitate flights for those who need to leave Afghanistan.

I want to emphasize that the evacuation mission is ongoing, and we are continuing our commitment to evacuate American citizens and Afghan allies. We are working closely with the Taliban to ensure safe passage to the airport for those who want to leave. While there have been some challenges, we are doing everything we can to overcome them and ensure the safety of all those involved.

I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to the men and women of the United States military who are working tirelessly to make this evacuation mission a success. Their bravery and selflessness are truly inspiring, and we owe them a debt of gratitude for their service.

In conclusion, I want to reiterate that the evacuation mission in Afghanistan is a promise kept. We are doing everything we can to help those in need, and we will continue to work tirelessly until the job is done. I ask that all Americans continue to support our efforts and keep those who are being evacuated in their thoughts and prayers.

Thank you, and may God bless the United States of America.
