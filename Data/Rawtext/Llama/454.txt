Palace Uproar: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Ink Four-Book Deal

In a move that has caused a stir within Buckingham Palace, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have reportedly secured a four-book deal with Penguin Random House. The deal, which includes a memoir by Harry and a wellness book by Meghan, has raised eyebrows among royal insiders, with some deeming it "appalling" to link any book release to the Queen's death.

According to sources, one of Harry's books is planned to follow the death of Queen Elizabeth II. However, a spokesperson for the couple has clarified that only one memoir by Harry is planned for late 2022. The subjects of the other two books in the deal remain undisclosed.

The negotiations for the deal were reportedly led by Harry from California, with a "take it or leave it" attitude. The prince is said to have demanded $25 million during negotiations, surprising the publishing team. The deal, especially Harry's memoir, has caused an uproar at Buckingham Palace, but it is believed to represent Harry's "truth."

Meghan Markle's children's book, "The Bench," became a New York Times Bestseller, and it is expected that her wellness book will be a hit as well. The couple's decision to pursue a book deal has sparked controversy, with some accusing them of cashing in on their royal status.

The news of the book deal comes after the couple's decision to step back from their royal duties and relocate to North America. The move has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising their desire to forge a new path and others criticizing their decision to abandon their royal responsibilities.

Despite the backlash, the couple has remained steadfast in their decision, with a source close to the couple stating, "They are excited to start this new chapter in their lives and to share their story with the world."

The book deal is seen as a way for the couple to share their experiences and perspectives with a wider audience. The memoir by Harry is expected to provide a unique insight into life within the royal family, while Meghan's wellness book will offer her perspective on health and wellness.

The deal has also sparked speculation about the future of the royal family, with some questioning whether the couple's decision to step back from their duties is a sign of things to come.

As the news of the book deal continues to make headlines, it is clear that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are determined to forge their own path, even if it means ruffling a few feathers within the palace walls.

In conclusion, the four-book deal between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and Penguin Random House has caused a stir within Buckingham Palace.
