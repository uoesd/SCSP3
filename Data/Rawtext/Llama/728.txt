Threat of Violence Shuts Down Reading Schools, 13-Year-Old Student Arrested

READING, Ohio (WXIX) – Reading schools were closed on Thursday due to a potential threat of violence from a student, causing concern and panic among parents, students, and the community.

According to District Superintendent Jason Enix, a 13-year-old student was arrested and charged with inducing panic following a school shooting threat. The student, who is part of the National Honor Society, was detained at the Hamilton County Juvenile Court Youth Center following arraignment.

"We take all threats seriously and will do everything in our power to ensure the safety of our students and staff," Enix said in a statement to parents.

The threat was spread through a Snapchat message warning students not to come to school. Reading police deemed the threat credible and arrested the student involved.

"I want to assure parents that we are taking this situation very seriously and are working closely with the Reading Police Department to investigate the matter," Enix said.

The incident is part of a wider pattern of threats against Tri-State school districts. In recent weeks, there have been several instances of threats against schools in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana.

"We understand that these types of threats can cause a lot of fear and anxiety, but we want to reassure parents that we are doing everything we can to keep our students and staff safe," Enix said.

The prosecution is insisting on holding the student until the next court hearing. Judge Melissa Powers said during the arraignment that the student's actions caused "a significant disruption to the educational environment."

"We take these types of threats very seriously and will do everything in our power to ensure that those responsible are held accountable," Powers said.

Classes are set to resume on Friday with additional police presence. Enix urged parents to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the authorities.

"We want to thank the Reading Police Department for their quick response and assistance in this matter," Enix said. "We will continue to work together to ensure the safety of our students and staff."

The community is coming together to support the school district and ensure the safety of its students. Local businesses have offered to provide additional security measures, and parents are being encouraged to talk to their children about the importance of reporting any suspicious activity.

"We are grateful for the support of our community during this time," Enix said. "We will continue to work together to ensure the safety and well-being of our students and staff."

The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of being vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity to the authorities. It also highlights the need for schools and law enforcement to work together to ensure the safety of students and staff.

"We will continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of our students and staff," Enix said. "We are committed to providing a safe and secure learning environment for all."

The investigation is ongoing, and additional charges may be filed. The school district is urging anyone with information about the threat to come forward and contact the authorities immediately.

"We want to thank everyone for their cooperation and support during this time," Enix said. "We will continue to work together to ensure the safety and well-being of our students and staff."
