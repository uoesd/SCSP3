Empowering the Future: The Importance of HBCUs in the 21st Century

As the Vice President of the United States, I am honored to address the critical role that Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) play in our nation's education, scientific research, and national security. In today's era, HBCUs are more vital than ever, particularly in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).

HBCUs have a rich history of educating leaders and innovators, and their contributions to our society cannot be overstated. From the pioneering work of Dr. Mae Jemison, the first African American woman in space, to the groundbreaking research of Dr. Ernest Everett Just, who made significant contributions to the field of cell biology, HBCUs have been at the forefront of scientific advancement.

One of the most exciting partnerships between an HBCU and a government agency is the collaboration between Hampton University and NASA. This partnership has led to the launch of satellites that provide valuable atmospheric data, furthering our understanding of the Earth's climate and the impact of human activity on our planet. This partnership is a prime example of how HBCUs can contribute to national security and scientific research, while also providing opportunities for students to gain hands-on experience in STEM fields.

In today's interconnected world, global challenges such as pandemics and climate change require cooperation and collaboration across borders and disciplines. HBCUs are essential in addressing these challenges, as they provide a diverse group of students with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle complex problems. By investing in HBCUs, we are investing in the future of our nation and the world.

Furthermore, it is crucial that we ensure diversity in STEM fields, particularly for women and people of color. The underrepresentation of these groups in STEM fields has far-reaching consequences, from the lack of diverse perspectives in research and development to the perpetuation of systemic inequalities. That is why initiatives like the Build Back agenda, which historic investments in research and development, are so important.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is another area where diversity is crucial. As we increasingly rely on AI to solve complex problems, it is essential that the people teaching the machines are diverse. This will ensure that the outcomes are equitable and do not perpetuate existing biases. HBCUs are leading the way in this area, providing opportunities for students from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in AI and related fields.

Investing in HBCUs is not only essential for our nation's strength and global competitiveness, but it is also a matter of societal participation and self-determination. By supporting HBCUs, we are empowering communities that have historically been marginalized and excluded from opportunities in higher education and STEM fields.

In conclusion, the importance of HBCUs in the 21st century cannot be overstated. They are critical in addressing national and global challenges, providing opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM fields, and ensuring that our society is equitable and just. As a nation, we must continue to support and invest in HBCUs, empowering the future leaders and innovators who will shape our world for generations to come. Thank you.
