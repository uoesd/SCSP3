Democrats Push for Stricter Gun Laws for Minors in Wisconsin

MADISON, Wis. (CBS 58) – In the wake of the Kyle Rittenhouse case, Democrats in Kenosha are introducing a bill to update Wisconsin's gun laws for minors. The proposed legislation aims to restrict minors from possessing long guns or rifles unless they are legally hunting.

The bill, introduced by State Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee), seeks to close a loophole that allowed Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, to carry a semiautomatic rifle during the Kenosha unrest. Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all charges, including underage gun possession, which was dropped by the judge.

"We need to make sure that our laws are protecting our kids and our communities," Larson said in a statement. "This bill will help prevent minors from carrying guns in public spaces and reduce the risk of gun violence."

However, Republican lawmakers oppose the bill, fearing it infringes on second amendment rights. State Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) expressed concern over the bill's impact on school rifle clubs.

"We need to be careful not to infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens, especially when it comes to recreational activities like hunting and target shooting," Testin said.

Democrats also introduced a package of bills aimed at safer gun storage and reporting of lost or stolen guns. The "Safe Storage for Gun Safety" plan, introduced by Rep. Tod Ohnstad (D-Kenosha) and Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison), aims to prevent gun violence and accidental shootings.

The plan includes measures such as requiring gun owners to store their firearms in a secure location, like a safe or lockbox, and mandating the reporting of lost or stolen guns to law enforcement within 24 hours.

"Gun safety is a critical issue that affects us all," Ohnstad said. "By ensuring that guns are stored safely and securely, we can prevent tragedies and keep our communities safe."

However, Republican leaders are unlikely to support the new measures due to their opposition to past gun control proposals.

The debate over gun control has been a contentious issue in Wisconsin, with Democrats pushing for stricter laws and Republicans arguing that such measures infringe on second amendment rights.

Despite the opposition, Democrats remain hopeful that the bill will pass and make a positive impact on the state.

"We owe it to our children and our communities to take action on gun safety," Subeck said. "We hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join us in this effort to make Wisconsin a safer place."

The bill is expected to be discussed in the upcoming legislative session, with a vote likely to take place in the coming months.

In conclusion, the proposed legislation aimed at updating Wisconsin's gun laws for minors has sparked a renewed debate over gun control in the state. While Democrats argue that the bill is necessary to prevent minors from carrying guns in public spaces and reduce the risk of gun violence, Republicans fear that it infringes on second amendment rights. The fate of the bill remains uncertain, but Democrats remain hopeful that it will pass and make a positive impact on the state.
