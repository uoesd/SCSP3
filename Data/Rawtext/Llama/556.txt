Afghan Children Injured in Kabul Airport Attack Arrive in US for Treatment

CNN – A 13-year-old boy and a 7-year-old girl, who were injured in the recent Kabul airport suicide bombing, have arrived in the United States for medical treatment. The children, Ahmad Faisal and Mina, were reunited with their aunt, Ferishta, who described the moment as the "best day of my life."

Ferishta, a US citizen, had been desperately trying to locate her niece and nephew after the attack, which killed their mother and injured several other family members. The children's father and older brother survived the attack but were separated from Ahmad Faisal and Mina in the chaos.

"I was so happy to see them, I couldn't believe it," Ferishta told CNN. "I was crying and laughing at the same time. It was the best day of my life."

The children were evacuated to Germany with a neighbor before being brought to the US for treatment. They are currently unaware of their mother's death, and Ferishta is waiting to inform them of the tragic news until they are settled with family in the US.

"I don't want to tell them yet, I want them to settle down first," Ferishta said. "They've been through so much, I don't want to add more stress to their lives."

Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. John Bradley, who runs the Lamia Afghan Foundation, assisted Ferishta in reuniting with her niece and nephew. Bradley sent documents to the family, leading them to the airport during the time of the attack.

"I feel responsible for their situation," Bradley told CNN. "I'm just glad we could help get them out of Afghanistan and to safety."

Efforts are now being made to reunite the entire family, including the father and other brother, in Virginia with Ferishta.

"We're working on getting the whole family reunited," Bradley said. "It's a long process, but we're doing everything we can to make sure they're safe and together."

Ferishta expressed her gratitude to Bradley and the Lamia Afghan Foundation for their help in reuniting her with her niece and nephew.

"I'm so thankful to General Bradley and the Lamia Afghan Foundation," Ferishta said. "They've been amazing, I don't know what I would have done without them."

The attack on the Kabul airport, which was carried out by ISIS-K, killed at least 12 people and injured several others. The family was attempting to flee Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover when they were caught in the attack.

"It's been a difficult time for everyone," Ferishta said. "But I'm just glad my niece and nephew are safe now. That's all that matters."

The arrival of Ahmad Faisal and Mina in the US comes as a ray of hope for the family, who have faced unimaginable tragedy in recent weeks. Their recovery will be a long and difficult process, but with the help of their family and medical professionals, they have a chance to heal and rebuild their lives.
