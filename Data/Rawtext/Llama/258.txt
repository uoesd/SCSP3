President Biden Renews Call for Transparent Investigation into COVID-19 Origins

Washington, D.C. - Today, President Joe Biden reiterated the importance of investigating the origins of COVID-19, recalling his early call for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to have access to China to better understand the virus. During a press briefing at the White House, the President highlighted the challenges faced in the early stages of the pandemic due to the inability to get inspectors into China.

In March, shortly after taking office, President Biden tasked the Intelligence Community with preparing a report on the virus's origins. The report, which was submitted to the President, outlined two likely scenarios but did not reach a definitive conclusion. In light of this, President Biden has requested the Intelligence Community to intensify their efforts to analyze information related to the virus's origins and report back with a more definitive conclusion within 90 days.

The investigation will involve multiple agencies, including National Labs, to support the Intelligence Community's work. President Biden emphasized the importance of collaboration with international partners to press China for a transparent investigation. The President stressed that understanding the origins of COVID-19 is crucial in preventing future pandemics and ensuring the safety and security of the American people. The White House will continue to provide updates on the progress of the investigation.
