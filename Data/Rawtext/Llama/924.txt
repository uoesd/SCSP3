Brady Bids Farewell: Buccaneers Look to Baker Mayfield and Beyond in 2023

Tom Brady, the legendary quarterback who led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a Super Bowl victory in 2020, has officially retired "for good" following the 2022-23 NFL season. The Buccaneers, however, are not dwelling on the past. They have moved on and are looking towards a promising future with their new quarterback, Baker Mayfield.

Mayfield, previously with the Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Rams, has signed a one-year deal with the Buccaneers potentially worth $8.5 million. The 2018 first-round pick is expected to bring a fresh energy to the team's offense, and fans are eager to see what he can do under center.

In addition to acquiring Mayfield, the Buccaneers have been busy during the offseason, re-signing corner Jamel Dean and linebacker Lavonte David, and signing running back Chase Edmonds. These moves demonstrate the team's commitment to building a strong roster for the upcoming season.

The Buccaneers' 2023 draft class is also generating excitement, with Pittsburgh interior defender Calijah Kancey, selected 19th overall, being the highlight of the class. Kancey is expected to bring a much-needed boost to the team's defensive line, and fans are eager to see how he will perform in the upcoming season.

As the Buccaneers prepare to open their season on the road against Minnesota on Sept. 10, fans are also getting ready to place their bets. For those new to betting on the Buccaneers, it's important to understand the basics.

Betting on the Buccaneers involves point spreads, over/unders (totals), moneylines, props, and futures. Point spreads refer to the margin of victory a team is expected to win by, with the favorite being denoted by a minus sign (-) and the underdog by a plus sign (+). For example, if the Buccaneers are favored by 7 points against the Vikings, the point spread would be listed as TB -7.

Over/unders, also known as totals, refer to the combined score of both teams. The sportsbook sets a number, and bettors can wager on whether the total score will be over or under that number. For example, if the total for the Buccaneers-Vikings game is set at 47, bettors can wager on whether the total score will be over 47 or under 47.

Moneylines refer to betting on the outcome of the game, with the favorite being denoted by a minus sign (-) and the underdog by a plus sign (+). For example, if the Buccaneers are favored to win against the Vikings, the moneyline would be listed as TB -200, meaning a $200 bet would be required to win $100.

Props, or proposition bets, refer to wagers on specific events within a game, such as the number of touchdowns scored or the number of yards gained by a player. For example, a prop bet for the Buccaneers-Vikings game could be on the number of passing yards for Baker Mayfield.

Futures refer to bets on the outcome of the season, such as which team will win the Super Bowl or which player will win the MVP award.

When it comes to betting on the Buccaneers, it's important to do your research and check sportsbook reviews for information on available bets and sign-up bonuses. This will help you make informed decisions and potentially increase your chances of winning.

In conclusion, the Buccaneers are looking towards a promising future with Baker Mayfield at the helm. With a solid roster and high expectations, the team is ready to take on the 2023 season. For fans, it's time to get ready to place their bets and cheer on their favorite team.
