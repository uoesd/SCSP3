Sen. Graham Vows to Strip Twitter of Legal Protections After Trump Ban

WASHINGTON (WCSC) – In the wake of Twitter's permanent ban of President Donald Trump from its platform, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has vowed to remove the legal protections that shield companies like Twitter from lawsuits.

Graham took to Twitter on Friday to express his discontent with the decision, comparing Trump's ban to the Ayatollah's ability to tweet. "It's ridiculous that Twitter would ban the President of the United States, but allow the Ayatollah to tweet freely," Graham said.

The senator criticized Big Tech for having "absolute immunity from being sued," a protection provided by Congress through Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Graham advocated for the repeal of Section 230 to place tech companies on the same legal footing as other companies.

Twitter banned Trump citing two tweets that violated its policies against glorifying violence. One of Trump's tweets announced he would not attend Joe Biden's inauguration, which Twitter interpreted as potentially encouraging violent acts. The platform also claimed that Trump's use of "American Patriots" could be seen as support for those committing violent acts at the U.S. Capitol.

Twitter mentioned concerns about future armed protests and a proposed attack on the U.S. Capitol and state capitol buildings. The platform stated that Trump's account was locked following the riot at the U.S. Capitol, which some attribute to his rhetoric.

Graham's determination to repeal Section 230 is not the first time he has taken aim at Big Tech. In 2020, he introduced the "Eliminating Absolute Immunity for Big Tech Act," which aimed to strip tech companies of their legal protections.

The senator's latest move has sparked debate over the role of social media in regulating free speech. Some argue that Twitter's ban of Trump was a necessary measure to prevent further violence, while others see it as a violation of his right to free speech.

Graham's proposal has also raised questions about the potential consequences for social media platforms if they were to lose their legal protections. Some experts warn that repealing Section 230 could lead to a flood of lawsuits against tech companies, potentially stifling innovation and free speech.

Despite the backlash, Graham remains steadfast in his belief that Big Tech must be held accountable for its actions. "It's time for Big Tech to be held accountable for their continued censorship and bias," he said. "Repealing Section 230 is a step in the right direction."

The debate over Twitter's ban of Trump and the role of Big Tech in regulating free speech is unlikely to subside anytime soon. As tensions continue to rise, it remains to be seen how lawmakers will address the issue and whether Graham's proposal will gain traction in Congress.
