Nikki Haley Blasts Trump for Capitol Riot, Predicts Political End

In a stunning rebuke, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley has criticized President Donald Trump for his behavior leading up to and following the Capitol riot on January 6. In an interview with Politico, Haley expressed disgust at Trump's attacks on former Vice President Mike Pence before the riot and predicted that Trump's political career is effectively over, regardless of the outcome of his second impeachment trial.

Haley's comments mark a significant shift in her stance toward Trump, indicating potential changes in her political approach if she runs for president in 2024. Despite previously not publicly challenging Trump's false claims of election fraud, Haley had expected him to accept his defeat after legal challenges failed.

"I think the president's behavior has been absolutely appalling," Haley said. "I am deeply disappointed in the president for betraying Mike Pence's loyalty and friendship. The fact that he would stoop so low as to attack Mike Pence, who has been nothing but loyal and supportive, is just unconscionable."

Haley emphasized the impact of Trump's words on his supporters and criticized his call for Pence to halt Biden's Electoral College certification. "The president's words have consequences, and in this case, they had devastating consequences," she said. "I am deeply saddened by the fact that the president would use his platform to incite violence and hatred."

Haley predicts Trump will not run for federal office again, citing his loss of influence and the fallout from the Capitol riot. "I think the president's political career is over," she said. "He's lost the support of many of his closest allies, and his actions have caused irreparable damage to his reputation."

Though critical of Trump's recent actions, Haley considers the impeachment trial a "waste of time" and believes Trump will face isolation and business losses. "I don't think the impeachment trial is going to change anything," she said. "The president's already lost the support of many people, and I think he'll continue to face consequences for his actions."

Politico's Tim Alberta suggests Haley is prepping for a 2024 presidential run based on her actions and interviews with people who know her. Alberta told CNN that Haley has been "laying the groundwork for a potential run" and has been "talking to donors, talking to operatives, talking to people in early states."

Haley's criticism of Trump marks a significant departure from her previous stance as a loyal Trump administration official. Her shift in tone may indicate a change in strategy as she eyes a potential presidential run in 2024.

In conclusion, Nikki Haley's blistering critique of Donald Trump's behavior leading up to and following the Capitol riot signals a significant shift in her approach to the president and potentially sets the stage for a 2024 presidential run. With her reputation as a strong and independent leader, Haley may be positioning herself as a viable alternative to Trump in the eyes of moderate Republicans and independents. Only time will tell if her gamble will pay off.
