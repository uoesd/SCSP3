Stimulus Checks: What You Need to Know as Payments End in 2021

BALTIMORE (WBFF/WKRC) – The American Rescue Plan's stimulus check payments have come to an end in 2021, with the final "plus-up" payments being sent to eligible families. Here's what you need to know about the payments and what's next for the Child Tax Credit.

The American Rescue Plan, signed into law in March 2021, provided $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, along with expanded Child Tax Credit benefits. However, the stimulus check payments have now ended, and there are no plans for monthly child tax credit payments in 2022.

However, some families may still be eligible for "plus-up" payments, which are being sent to families who experienced changes in their income or family size in 2020. These changes may include a decrease in income or the addition of a child, which could result in a larger payment.

Economic Impact Payments are still available for individuals making $75,000 or less, or married couples making $150,000 or less. The IRS will continue to send out "plus-up" payments until December 31, based on the legislative deadline.

Democrats are planning to continue efforts to extend the Child Tax Credit payments into 2022. A one-year extension of the Child Tax Credit would cost $185 billion, while extending it for 10 years would cost $1.6 trillion.

It's important to note that the "plus-up" payments are based on changes noted in 2020 tax filings, so it's essential to file your taxes as soon as possible to ensure you receive any eligible payments.

In conclusion, while the stimulus check payments have ended, some families may still be eligible for "plus-up" payments based on changes in their income or family size. Additionally, efforts to extend the Child Tax Credit payments into 2022 are ongoing. It's essential to stay informed and file your taxes promptly to ensure you receive any eligible payments.
