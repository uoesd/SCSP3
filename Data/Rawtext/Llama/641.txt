Kenosha Jury Views Videos of Kyle Rittenhouse Shootings, Hears Self-Defense Claim

KENOSHA – A jury in Kenosha County has viewed videos showing Kyle Rittenhouse shooting three men during protests in August 2020. This was the first time the jury saw these videos pieced together, depicting the events that led to the deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, and the injury of Gaige Grosskreutz. Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, has pleaded not guilty, claiming self-defense in the shootings.

The videos shown to the jury included Rittenhouse's pre-shooting interviews and scenes from the night, including the moment he shot the three men. Testimony included Rittenhouse's actions before the shootings and observations from social media influencer Koerri Washington.

According to the videos, Rosenbaum, who was unarmed, chased Rittenhouse and threw a plastic bag at him before being shot. Grosskreutz, who was also unarmed, was shot by Rittenhouse and was seen instructing others on how to apply a tourniquet to his injured arm.

After shooting Grosskreutz, Rittenhouse approached police with raised arms, but was ignored. The defense stressed the threat of disarmament, with detective Martin Howard testifying that it's reasonable to fear one's gun could be used against them.

"As a police officer, I can tell you that the threat of disarmament is a real concern," said Detective Howard. "In a situation like this, it's understandable that Rittenhouse would fear for his safety and the safety of his weapon."

Koerri Washington, a social media influencer who was at the protests, testified that she saw Rittenhouse before the shootings and described him as "nervous" and "agitated."

"I could tell that he was looking for trouble," Washington said. "He was pacing back and forth, and he seemed like he was itching for a fight."

The jury also heard testimony from Rittenhouse's friend, Dominick Black, who purchased the AR-15-style rifle used in the shootings. Black testified that Rittenhouse had been planning to attend the protests for days and had expressed concerns about his safety.

"Kyle told me that he was worried about being hurt or killed at the protests," Black said. "He said he wanted to protect himself and his friends."

The defense has argued that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, citing the threat of disarmament and the violent nature of the protests. The prosecution, however, has argued that Rittenhouse's actions were reckless and unnecessary, and that he should be held accountable for the deaths and injuries he caused.

The jury is expected to continue deliberating for several days, weighing the evidence and testimony presented in the case. The outcome of the trial could have significant implications for the community of Kenosha and beyond, as it raises questions about the use of force and the role of armed civilians in protests.

As the jury deliberates, the community remains divided on the issue of Rittenhouse's guilt or innocence. Some argue that he acted in self-defense, while others believe he should be held accountable for the deaths and injuries he caused.

Regardless of the outcome, the trial has brought attention to the ongoing issues of police brutality and systemic racism that sparked the protests in the first place. It serves as a reminder that there is still much work to be done to address these issues and ensure that justice is served for all members of the community.
