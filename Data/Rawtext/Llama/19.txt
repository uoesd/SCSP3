Increased Security Measures Sought for Biden's Inauguration After Capitol Hill Riot

Washington, DC – In the wake of the deadly Capitol Hill riot on January 6, Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has requested increased security measures for President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, which is scheduled to take place on January 20.

In a letter to the US Department of Homeland Security, Bowser emphasized the need for a different approach to security following the events of January 6, which left five people dead, including a police officer, after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building.

"The safety and security of our city and its residents and visitors is of the utmost importance, and we must take all necessary precautions to prevent any further violence and ensure a peaceful transition of power," Bowser wrote.

Bowser's letter highlighted several specific measures that she believes are necessary to ensure the safety of the inauguration, including daily intelligence and threat briefings from the FBI and the cancellation of all public gathering permits during the period of January 11-24.

The mayor also requested coordination among the Homeland Security, Defense, Justice departments, Congress, and the Supreme Court for federal force deployment.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer echoed Bowser's concerns, emphasizing the ongoing high threat from violent extremist groups as Biden's inauguration approaches.

"The events of January 6 were a stark reminder of the dangers that our country faces from domestic terrorism, and it is imperative that we take all necessary steps to prevent any further violence and ensure the safety of our citizens," Schumer said.

The US Department of Justice has charged two more alleged rioters, as investigations into the riot continue. Police and fire departments in various states are also investigating members who may have participated in the riot.

US Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy informed US Representative Jason Crow that 25 domestic terrorism cases have been opened in relation to the riot.

In light of the heightened security concerns, President Trump has announced that he will not attend Biden's inauguration, which will be a scaled-down event due to COVID-19, similar to the Democratic National Convention.

Despite the increased security measures, Bowser has emphasized that the inauguration will still be a celebration of democracy and the peaceful transfer of power.

"We will not let the actions of a few extremists deter us from our commitment to democracy and the rule of law," Bowser said. "We will come together as a nation to celebrate the inauguration of President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris, and we will do so in a safe and peaceful manner."

The increased security measures come as law enforcement agencies across the country are on high alert, with the FBI warning of potential violence and unrest leading up to the inauguration.

As the nation prepares for the transition of power, the events of January 6 serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges facing the country, and the need for vigilance and cooperation in ensuring the safety and security of all Americans.
