Unusual Restrictions and Delays in National Guard Deployment During Capitol Riot Revealed

WASHINGTON (AP) – New details have emerged regarding the Defense Department's handling of the National Guard's response to the Capitol riot on January 6, revealing unusual restrictions and delays in their deployment.

According to Maj. Gen. William Walker, the Commanding General of the District of Columbia National Guard, the Defense Department imposed restrictions on the National Guard's response to the riot, delaying their deployment to the Capitol. Walker reported that the Defense Department took hours to approve the deployment of National Guard troops, resulting in their arrival several hours after the first request for help.

Pentagon officials have confirmed that they were concerned about the optics of a substantial National Guard presence at the Capitol, which may have contributed to the delay in deployment.

Senate hearings held in the aftermath of the riot have revealed mishandling and a lack of preparation by law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, which faced scrutiny for not adequately sharing intelligence warnings of violence. Capitol Police were also aware of a possible plot by a militia group to breach the Capitol again, but failed to take adequate measures to prevent the violence.

The exact timeline and approval process for National Guard deployment on January 6 remain a subject of controversy, with officials blaming one another for the security failures during the Capitol riot. Congressional investigations are ongoing, focusing on security failures and the motivations behind the riot.

Robert Salesses, a senior Pentagon official, acknowledged that the Defense Department's response to the riot was "inadequate" and apologized for the delay in deploying the National Guard.

Jill Sanborn, the Bureau's top counterterrorism official, FBI, defended the agency's handling of intelligence, stating that the FBI had shared all relevant information with its partners.

Robert Contee, the acting chief of police, Metropolitan Police Department, expressed frustration with the lack of coordination between law enforcement agencies, stating that his department had not received adequate support during the riot.

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Rules Committee, criticized the lack of preparedness and coordination among law enforcement agencies, stating that "it's unacceptable that it took so long to get the National Guard to the Capitol."

The revelations of the Defense Department's handling of the National Guard's response to the Capitol riot have raised concerns about the preparedness and response capabilities of law enforcement agencies in the nation's capital. The ongoing congressional investigations aim to address these concerns and ensure that such security failures are not repeated in the future.
