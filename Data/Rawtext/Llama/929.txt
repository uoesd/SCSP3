Trump Acquitted in Second Impeachment Trial, but Condemned by McConnell

WASHINGTON (AP) – Former President Donald Trump was acquitted in his second impeachment trial on Saturday, with the Senate voting 57-43, falling short of the two-thirds majority needed for conviction. Despite the acquittal, Trump was condemned by Republican leader Mitch McConnell as "practically and morally responsible" for the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6.

The trial was marked by a bipartisan vote to convict Trump, with seven Republicans joining all Democrats in voting to convict. President Joe Biden emphasized the bipartisan nature of the conviction vote and the importance of defending truth.

Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), a House prosecutor, described Trump as the "inciter in chief" with a months-long campaign of violent rhetoric. "He summoned his supporters to Washington, D.C., on January 6, and he told them to fight like hell," Dean said.

Trump's lawyers argued that his words were not intended to incite violence and framed the impeachment as a "witch hunt." Michael van der Veen, one of Trump's lawyers, said, "The article of impeachment is a constitutional monstrosity. It is a creation of the imagination of the House managers."

Senators acknowledged the gravity of the riot but were divided on Trump's responsibility and the appropriateness of impeachment. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, "The Senate has spoken, but the voices of the American people have not been silenced."

Second-ranking Republican John Thune said, "The impeachment process has been a difficult and contentious one, but it's important to remember that it's a constitutional process."

Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said, "I think the president's behavior was inappropriate, but I don't think it rises to the level of impeachment."

The trial highlighted the fragility of America's democratic traditions and the country's deep divisions. President Biden said, "The events of January 6 were a grave reminder of the importance of our democratic institutions and the rule of law."

In a statement after the acquittal, Trump thanked his legal team and supporters, saying, "This has been a difficult time for me and my family, but I am grateful for the support of so many Americans who have stood by me."

Despite the acquittal, Trump faces ongoing legal challenges, including a criminal investigation into his role in the insurrection. The trial also raises questions about the appropriateness of impeachment and the role of the Senate in holding presidents accountable for their actions.

In the end, the acquittal of Donald Trump highlights the deep divisions in American society and the challenges facing the country's democratic institutions. As President Biden said, "The work of defending our democracy is never done, and we must continue to strive for a more perfect union."
