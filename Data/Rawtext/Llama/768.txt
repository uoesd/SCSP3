Arizona Armorer Mentor Seth Kenney Linked to Fatal 'Rust' Movie Set Shooting

A tragic accident on the set of the movie "Rust" has left one crew member dead and another injured, and an Arizona armorer mentor, Seth Kenney, is at the center of the investigation. Kenney, who runs a prop house in Arizona, supplied the guns used on the set, including the Colt .45 that Alec Baldwin used to fatally shoot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

Kenney also recommended Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the gun expert on the "Rust" set, for the position. Gutierrez Reed has come under scrutiny following the incident, with reports emerging of her previous mishandling of firearms on another film set.

Stu Brumbaugh, a key grip on the film "The Old Way," which also employed Gutierrez Reed, expressed concerns about her handling of firearms. "She was a bit careless with the guns," Brumbaugh said. "I remember one time, she was handling a gun and she accidentally pointed it at me. I was like, 'What are you doing?'"

The investigation into the "Rust" shooting is ongoing, and it remains unclear what role Kenney may have played in the incident. Kenney's company, Phoenix Props and Costumes, supplied the guns and ammunition used on the set, but it is not known whether he was present on the set at the time of the shooting.

Gutierrez Reed's lawyers have suggested that there may have been "sabotage" on the set, and that a live bullet may have been intentionally placed in the gun used by Baldwin. However, investigators have not confirmed this theory, and the incident is still being treated as an accident.

Kenney has a long history of working with major prop houses and as a weapons consultant on films. He has worked on a number of high-profile productions, including the TV series "The Mandalorian" and the film "The Ballad of Buster Scruggs."

The incident on the "Rust" set has raised questions about the safety protocols in place on film sets, and the responsibility of armorers and other crew members to ensure the safety of everyone involved. As the investigation continues, it remains to be seen what consequences, if any, Kenney and Gutierrez Reed may face.

In a statement, the producers of "Rust" expressed their condolences to the family of Halyna Hutchins and promised to cooperate fully with the investigation. "We are heartbroken and devastated by the tragic accident that occurred on our set," the statement read. "We are fully cooperating with the authorities to determine how this happened and to ensure that it never happens again."

The incident has also sparked a wider conversation about the use of firearms on film sets, and whether enough is being done to ensure the safety of crew members. As the investigation into the "Rust" shooting continues, it is clear that this tragic incident will have far-reaching consequences for the film industry as a whole.
