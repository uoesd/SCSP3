Oprah Winfrey's Media Empire: How She's Still a Force to Be Reckoned With

In a world where streaming services dominate the entertainment industry, Oprah Winfrey continues to prove that live-event television still has a place in our hearts. Her recent interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, which aired on CBS, drew in an impressive 17 million viewers, solidifying Winfrey's position as a media mogul.

The success of the interview highlights Winfrey's savvy media strategy, which includes diversely engaging with multiple platforms. In addition to her significant content deal with Apple, she has also been producing projects for Warner Bros. This move has allowed her to reach a wider audience and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of the entertainment industry.

But Winfrey's business acumen doesn't stop there. The reported sale of the Harry and Meghan interview to CBS for $7 million is a testament to her ability to monetize her content and secure lucrative deals. According to Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School, "Oprah has always been very smart about selecting the appropriate platform for her content. She's not wedded to any one medium, and that's what makes her so successful."

The special achieved a 2.6 rating among adults ages 18 to 49, indicating strong interest from younger viewers. This is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that Winfrey's influence extends beyond her traditional audience of older viewers.

Despite the success of the interview, it's worth noting that Winfrey's continued influence in media contrasts with the streaming limitations of the CBS special. Due to existing deals, the interview was not available on streaming platforms, which may have limited its reach. However, this hasn't stopped Prince Harry and Meghan Markle from pursuing their own media ventures, including a deal with Netflix and a podcast on Spotify.

In addition to her work in television, Winfrey's Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) is now 95 percent owned by Discovery, following her sale of shares. This move has significantly increased the value of her investment, further solidifying her position as a media mogul.

Winfrey's exchange of shares for Discovery stock exemplifies her strategic business movements. According to Koehn, "Oprah has always been very strategic about her business decisions. She's not afraid to take risks, but she also knows how to play the long game."

In conclusion, Oprah Winfrey's interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle serves as a reminder of her continued influence in media. Her ability to adapt to changing trends, diversify her content, and secure lucrative deals has allowed her to maintain her position as a force to be reckoned with in the entertainment industry. As Koehn notes, "Oprah is a true media mogul, and she's not going anywhere anytime soon."
