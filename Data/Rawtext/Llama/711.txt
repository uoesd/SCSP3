Iowa Teens Charged with Murder of High School Spanish Teacher Nohema Graber

DES MOINES, Iowa – In a shocking and tragic turn of events, two Iowa teenagers, Willard Noble Chaiden Miller and Jeremy Everett Goodale, both 16, have been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Fairfield High School Spanish teacher Nohema Graber. Graber's body was discovered in Fairfield's Chautauqua Park under a tarp, wheelbarrow, and railroad ties, with evidence of inflicted trauma to the head.

According to Jefferson County Attorney Chauncey Moulding, the suspects will be charged as adults due to the severity of the crime and their ages. "This is a tragic event that has shaken our community to its core," Moulding said in a statement. "We will ensure that justice is served and that these individuals are held accountable for their actions."

Graber, 66, was a beloved figure in the Fairfield community, known for her dedication to her students and her passion for teaching. "She was a leader in our community, especially within the Latino community," said Edith Cabrera, a friend of Graber's. "She was deeply loving towards her family, students, and friends, and her loss will be deeply felt."

Fairfield High School canceled classes following the incident, as the community struggled to come to terms with the senseless act of violence. "We are heartbroken by the loss of our teacher and friend, Nohema Graber," said Laurie Noll, Superintendent of the Fairfield Community School District. "Our top priority is the well-being of our students and staff, and we will do everything in our power to support them through this difficult time."

The investigation into Graber's murder was aided by social media activity and a search of the suspects' homes. "We are grateful for the cooperation of the community and the efforts of our law enforcement partners in bringing these individuals to justice," Moulding said.

Mike Beranek, President of the Iowa State Education Association, expressed his condolences to Graber's family and highlighted the role of educators in protecting their students. "Educators are not just teachers, they are mentors, role models, and guardians of their students' well-being," Beranek said. "We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that our schools are safe and supportive environments for all students."

As the community grapples with the motivations behind the violent act, many are left searching for answers. "I cannot fathom why anyone would do this to such a kind and caring person," said Cabrera. "Nohema was a shining light in our community, and her loss will be felt for years to come."

In the wake of this tragedy, the Fairfield community has come together to support Graber's family and to remember her legacy. "Nohema was a true educator, dedicated to her students and her community," said Noll. "We will honor her memory by continuing to provide a safe and supportive environment for all of our students."

As the investigation continues, the community is left to grapple with the senseless act of violence that took the life of a beloved teacher and mentor. "We will never forget Nohema Graber and the impact she had on our lives," said Beranek. "We will continue to work towards a world where all students can learn and grow in safety and peace."
