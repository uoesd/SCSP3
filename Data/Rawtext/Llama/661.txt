Kyle Rittenhouse's Arizona State University Enrollment Sparks Controversy

Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old who was acquitted of all charges related to the shooting of two people at a 2020 protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has sparked controversy once again. During a recent podcast appearance, Rittenhouse announced that he would be attending Arizona State University (ASU) in-person for the spring semester. However, according to ASU spokesperson Jay Thorne, Rittenhouse has not applied to the university and is welcome to do so like any other applicant.

Rittenhouse previously took a "compassionate withdrawal" from two online nursing classes at ASU, and his enrollment status at the university has been a topic of debate following his trial and acquittal. Despite this, Rittenhouse claims that he is still an admitted student at ASU and possesses a student portfolio, although he is not currently taking any classes.

The controversy surrounding Rittenhouse's enrollment at ASU has led to protests on the university campus, both against and in support of his potential attendance. Some students and faculty have expressed concerns about Rittenhouse's presence on campus, while others have defended his right to an education.

In a statement provided to Forbes, Jay Thorne, an Arizona State spokesperson, clarified Rittenhouse's application status. "Kyle Rittenhouse has not applied to Arizona State University. He is welcome to apply like any other applicant, and his application would be reviewed and considered in the same manner as any other applicant," Thorne said.

Rittenhouse has expressed his intent to pursue an undergraduate degree and eventually go to law school. Despite the controversy surrounding his enrollment at ASU, he remains optimistic about his future. "I'm just trying to move on with my life and focus on my education," Rittenhouse said during his podcast appearance.

A representative for Rittenhouse did not immediately respond to Forbes' request for comment.

In conclusion, Kyle Rittenhouse's enrollment status at Arizona State University has sparked controversy and debate, with some students and faculty expressing concerns about his presence on campus. Despite this, Rittenhouse remains hopeful about his future and his ability to pursue his educational goals.
