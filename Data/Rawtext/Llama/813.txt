Promises and Reality: A Look at the $2,000 Stimulus Checks

In the lead-up to the Senate runoff elections in Georgia, President Joe Biden, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Senator Bernie Sanders were among those who touted $2,000 stimulus payments as part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. "We're going to provide $2,000 stimulus checks to help people who are struggling," said President-elect Biden in December 2020.

However, when the American Rescue Plan was signed into law on March 11, 2021, the stimulus checks were not the $2,000 that was initially promised. Instead, the legislation included $1,400 stimulus checks for individuals and $2,800 for married and joint filers.

Some Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Cori Bush, highlighted the discrepancy between the promised $2,000 and the delivered $1,400 checks. "The American people were promised $2,000 stimulus checks. They deserve nothing less," said Rep. Ocasio-Cortez in a tweet.

There were also proposals for providing $2,000 stimulus checks on a monthly basis until the end of the Covid-19 pandemic. "We should provide a $2,000 stimulus check every month until this pandemic is over," said Sen. Sanders in a statement.

Criticisms were raised against President Biden for not delivering on the full $2,000 stimulus check as promised. "The President's failure to deliver on his promise of $2,000 stimulus checks is a betrayal of the American people," said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) in a statement.

The Biden administration argued that the combination of the second stimulus check of $600 and the third of $1,400 equals $2,000 in total stimulus payments. "We've delivered $2,000 in stimulus payments to the American people, just as we promised," said President Biden in a statement.

However, some critics argue that the promise of $2,000 stimulus checks was a political ploy to win votes in the Georgia runoff elections. "The promise of $2,000 stimulus checks was nothing more than a cynical political ploy to win votes in Georgia," said Rep. Cori Bush in a tweet.

Despite the controversy, the American Rescue Plan has been praised for its efforts to provide relief to those affected by the pandemic. A family of four could receive a total of $5,600 in stimulus payments from the third stimulus check, under the conditions laid out in the legislation.

In conclusion, while the promise of $2,000 stimulus checks was not fully delivered, the American Rescue Plan has provided much-needed relief to those affected by the pandemic. It is up to the readers to decide if the "promise" was kept.
