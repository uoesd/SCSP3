David Haye Eager to Fight Tyson Fury Despite Setbacks, but Fury Not Interested

David Haye, the former world heavyweight champion, has expressed a desire to fight Tyson Fury, despite a series of professional setbacks and a recent retirement. However, Fury, who recently retained his WBC title with an 11th-round knockout win against Deontay Wilder, has made it clear that he has no interest in facing Haye in the ring.

In an interview with Sky Sports, Haye said, "I'd love to fight Tyson Fury. I've been saying it for years. I know it's not a 50-50 fight, but I believe I can win." However, Fury has publicly stated that he will never give Haye a chance to fight him, calling Haye a "pretender" and a "fraud."

Fury's father, John Fury, also criticized Haye's punditry and expressed no respect for him. "Haye's a joke, he's a pretender, he's not a fighter," John Fury said. "He's been talking rubbish for years, and he's not worth our time."

Haye has a history of pulling out of fights, including two scheduled bouts with Fury due to injuries. In 2018, Haye suffered a knockout defeat to Tony Bellew, and his recent boxing activities include an exhibition match with Joe Fournier. Despite a lack of recent significant wins, Haye is adamant about fighting Fury.

Fury's promoter, Frank Warren, suggests that Haye would need to earn a rating by fighting and defeating a rated fighter before considering a bout with Fury. "David Haye needs to get some wins under his belt before we can even think about a fight with Tyson Fury," Warren said.

Tyson Fury's future fights include matches against Dillian Whyte, Anthony Joshua, and possibly Derek Chisora, with no mention of Haye. When asked about the possibility of a fight with Haye, Fury replied, "I'm not interested in fighting David Haye. He's not a credible opponent."

Despite Fury's reluctance, Haye remains confident that he could win a fight against Fury. "I know it's a tough ask, but I believe in my ability," Haye said. "I've been in with some of the best fighters in the world, and I've come out on top. I'm not afraid of Tyson Fury."

However, Fury's recent success in the ring, including his victory over Wilder, has cemented his position as one of the top heavyweight fighters in the world. A fight between Haye and Fury would likely be seen as a mismatch, with Fury as the heavy favorite.

In conclusion, while David Haye is eager to fight Tyson Fury, Fury has made it clear that he has no interest in facing Haye in the ring. With a lack of recent significant wins and a history of pulling out of fights, Haye faces an uphill battle in convincing Fury and the boxing world that he is a credible opponent.
