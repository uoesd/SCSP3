MISSING: Gabby Petito, 22, Last Seen Traveling Through Utah and Wyoming

SALT LAKE CITY – Authorities are actively searching for Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old woman from Blue Point, New York, who was last seen traveling through Utah and Wyoming with her boyfriend.

Gabby and her boyfriend embarked on a cross-country trip on July 2, documenting their adventures on social media. They visited popular destinations such as Colorado, Southern Utah, Arches National Park, and Canyonlands National Park. However, Petito's Instagram posts slowed down towards the end of August, with the last communication on August 30 being uncertain.

The last known location of Petito was Salt Lake City on August 21, confirmed through an Uber Eats order placed by her father, Joseph Petito. "We know she was here in Salt Lake City, but after that, we don't know where she went," Joseph said in an interview.

Petito's parents believe the couple left Salt Lake City for Grand Teton National Park around August 24, spending no more than two days there. However, communication between Petito and her mother, Nichole Schmidt, became sporadic after August 24, with the nature of Petito's relationship with her boyfriend in question.

"We're worried sick. We just want to know where she is and that she's safe," Schmidt said, her voice trembling with concern.

The Suffolk County Police Department has confirmed the retrieval of the van used by the couple, but they have provided no information on the boyfriend's whereabouts. A case has officially been opened by the Suffolk County Police Department, and the public is urged to provide information.

"We're asking for anyone who may have seen Gabby or her boyfriend to come forward and share any information they may have," said a spokesperson for the Suffolk County Police Department.

Petito's parents have established a Facebook page for updates and a GoFundMe page to help with expenses. "We're grateful for any help we can get. We just want Gabby back safe and sound," Schmidt said.

The disappearance of Gabby Petito has sent shockwaves through the community, with many people sharing her story and offering support to her family. "We're grateful for the outpouring of support and concern. We're hopeful that Gabby will be found soon," Joseph said.

As the search for Gabby Petito continues, authorities are urging anyone with information to come forward. "We're working tirelessly to find Gabby and bring her home safely. We need the public's help to make that happen," the spokesperson for the Suffolk County Police Department said.

The case of Gabby Petito's disappearance remains a mystery, with many questions still unanswered. One thing is certain, however: her family and friends are desperate for answers and are holding onto hope that she will be found soon.
