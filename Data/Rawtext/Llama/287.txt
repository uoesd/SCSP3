AMA Urges Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccination for Health Care Workers to Protect Patients and Colleagues

CHICAGO - The American Medical Association (AMA) today emphasized the critical importance of COVID-19 vaccination for health care workers to protect patients, colleagues, and vulnerable populations. In a statement issued by Immediate Past President Susan R. Bailey, M.D., the AMA highlighted the growing support for universal vaccination of health workers and called on all health care and long-term care employers to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for their employees.

"As health care professionals, we have a sacred duty to protect our patients and colleagues from harm," said Dr. Bailey. "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. With over 300 million doses administered in the US and nearly 4 billion worldwide, the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines are well established. It is our responsibility to ensure that all health care workers are vaccinated to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect vulnerable populations."

The AMA's call for mandatory COVID-19 vaccination comes as the US experiences a surge in cases, driven by contagious variants and unvaccinated populations. Despite the availability of effective vaccines, many health care and long-term care workers remain unvaccinated, putting vulnerable populations at risk.

"We cannot afford to wait any longer," said Dr. Bailey. "The time to act is now. We urge all health care and long-term care employers to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for their employees. This is not only a matter of personal choice, but also a matter of patient safety and public health."

The AMA's statement echoes the growing support for universal vaccination of health workers among experts and institutions. While some workers may be exempt from mandates due to medical reasons, the vast majority of health care workers can and should be vaccinated. Existing vaccine mandates have been effective in protecting health care workers and patients, but historical mistrust in health care institutions must be addressed through transparent communication and education.

"We must lead by example," said Dr. Bailey. "The health care community's leadership in implementing vaccine mandates can be a model for all employers. By taking a strong stance on vaccination, we can demonstrate our commitment to patient safety and public health, and encourage other industries to follow suit."

The AMA's call for mandatory COVID-19 vaccination is part of a broader effort to protect vulnerable populations and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. As the pandemic continues to evolve, the AMA remains committed to providing evidence-based guidance and advocating for policies that prioritize patient safety and public health.

"We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that all health care workers are equipped with the tools and resources they need to protect themselves, their patients, and their communities," said Dr. Bailey. "Vaccination is a crucial step in this effort, and we urge all health care and long-term care employers to join us in this important fight."
