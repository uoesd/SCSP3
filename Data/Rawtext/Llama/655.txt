Judge Limits Evidence in Kyle Rittenhouse Trial, Cites Concerns Over Vigilantism and Politics

Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder has made several key rulings in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old accused of killing two people and injuring another during a protest in August. In a pre-trial hearing on Wednesday, Judge Schroeder denied requests to use evidence aiming to show Rittenhouse's inclination for vigilantism and rejected a defense request to introduce evidence about one victim's criminal background.

Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger had requested to introduce evidence that Rittenhouse had a history of vigilantism, including social media posts and messages that showed his desire to use violence against perceived criminals. However, Judge Schroeder ruled that such evidence was not relevant to the case and could prejudice the jury.

"I don't think it's relevant to show that the defendant had a propensity for vigilantism," Judge Schroeder said. "I think that's a dangerous road to go down."

Defense attorney Mark Richards had also requested to introduce evidence about the criminal background of one of the victims, 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum. Richards argued that the evidence was relevant to show that Rosenbaum was not an innocent bystander, but Judge Schroeder ruled that it was not relevant to the case.

"I don't think it's relevant to the issues in this case," Judge Schroeder said. "I think it's an attempt to smear the victim."

Prosecutors are still required to provide addresses for about 27 potential witnesses, and a separate pre-trial hearing will be held to discuss the admission of testimony from use-of-force experts. The trial is scheduled to start on November 1.

In addition, prosecutors revealed that they have infrared video from an FBI airplane purportedly showing Rittenhouse chasing his first victim, 26-year-old Anthony Huber. However, Judge Schroeder has yet to decide on whether potential jurors will be asked to fill out questionnaires before selection.

Judge Schroeder expressed concerns over the content of the questionnaires, stressing that the trial is not to be political.

"I don't want this trial to be about politics," Judge Schroeder said. "I want it to be about the facts of the case."

The judge also withheld a final ruling on introducing an incident of Rittenhouse expressing a desire to use a rifle against perceived looters. A motion to dismiss a misdemeanor charge of Rittenhouse possessing a firearm as a minor has yet to be ruled on.

Rittenhouse faces charges of first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, and attempted first-degree intentional homicide, as well as lesser charges. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

The case has garnered national attention and sparked debates over gun rights, vigilantism, and the use of force by law enforcement. The trial is expected to be closely watched and could have significant implications for the community and the nation.
