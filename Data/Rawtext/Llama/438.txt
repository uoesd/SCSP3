Harry and Meghan's Oprah Interview: A Shift from Royalty to Hollywood Elite?

As the world eagerly awaits Oprah Winfrey's highly anticipated interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, questions abound about the couple's shift from British royalty to potential Hollywood elite. The interview, which will be the couple's first since stepping back from their royal duties in early 2020, has sparked both excitement and controversy on both sides of the Atlantic.

In the US, the interview is being hailed as a major coup for Oprah, who has become close to the couple since they moved to the country. "This interview is a big deal because it's the first time we've seen Harry and Meghan speak publicly since they left the royal family," said Robert Thompson, Professor of TV and Film at Syracuse University's Newhouse School. "It's also significant because it's Oprah, who is one of the most influential women in media."

However, in the UK, concerns have been raised over the timing of the interview, with Prince Philip currently hospitalized. Some have accused the palace of launching a "smear" campaign against the Sussexes, who have been vocal about their experiences with racism and the media. "The palace is trying to discredit Harry and Meghan because they're seen as a threat to the monarchy," said Keli Goff, a US columnist. "They're trying to paint them as ungrateful and disloyal, but the public isn't buying it."

Despite the backlash, the Sussexes have been active in the US, discussing issues like racism, police brutality, and voting rights. They have also secured deals with Netflix and Spotify, signaling a potential shift towards a more Hollywood-focused career path. "They're not just royalty, they're also celebrities, and they're using their platform to make a difference," said Maiysha Kai, Managing Editor of the Glow Up and Co-host of The Root Presents: It's Lit.

The couple's move and statements have been credited with changing the royal family and continuing to challenge the monarchy. "They're breaking away from the traditional royal mold and forging their own path," said Mark Borkowski, a British brand expert. "They're not afraid to speak their truth and challenge the status quo, which is something that the royal family has never been known for."

Winfrey's interview is expected to cover a range of topics, including the racism Meghan faced in the UK, their treatment by the British press, and their motivation for moving to the US. "This interview is an opportunity for Harry and Meghan to address misconceptions and criticisms, particularly the term 'Megxit'," said Thompson. "They'll be able to tell their side of the story and set the record straight."

According to a recent poll, Queen Elizabeth II remains the favorite royal among Americans, but Harry and Meghan are also popular. The formal separation of Harry and Meghan from royal duties allows for a possible re-invention of their public image. "They have the opportunity to rebrand themselves and create a new identity outside of the royal family," said Borkowski.

As the world waits with bated breath for the Oprah interview, it's clear that Harry and Meghan's move to the US marks a significant shift in their relationship with the royal family. Whether they'll be able to successfully transition from royalty to Hollywood elite remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: this interview will be a defining moment in their journey.
