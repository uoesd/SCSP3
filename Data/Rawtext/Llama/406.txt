Expert Testifies Officer Had Knee on George Floyd's Neck Area During Entire Encounter

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – A use-of-force expert testified on Wednesday that Officer Derek Chauvin had his knee on George Floyd's neck area for the entire encounter, contradicting the defense's suggestion that Chauvin's knee was sometimes on Floyd's shoulder blade or base of his neck.

Jody Stiger, a Los Angeles Police Department sergeant and prosecution witness, stated that Chauvin applied pressure on Floyd's neck or neck area throughout the restraint period. "I saw Officer Chauvin's knee on Mr. Floyd's neck area the entire time," Stiger said.

Stiger's testimony supported the prosecution's argument that Chauvin used excessive force against Floyd, who died during the arrest for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill. Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death.

Defense attorney Eric Nelson suggested that Chauvin's knee was not solely on Floyd's neck, citing a longer video clip that showed Chauvin's knee on Floyd's shoulder blade or base of his neck at times. However, Stiger maintained that Chauvin's knee was still on Floyd's neck area, even when it appeared to be on his shoulder blade or base of his neck.

Minnesota state investigator James Reyerson initially misheard Floyd's statement on drug use but corrected his understanding after a longer video clip was played. Reyerson testified about the timeline of Chauvin's knee placement after Floyd ceased talking and moving.

The defense has suggested that drug use and health conditions were the cause of Floyd's death, rather than Chauvin's actions. Fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd's system. Stiger acknowledged that police actions can be "lawful but awful," and discussed the impact of an onlooking crowd perceived as hostile by police.

Chauvin's lawyer argued that Chauvin's actions should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, not in hindsight. Stiger mentioned that Chauvin used pain compliance techniques on Floyd and didn't ease up despite Floyd's visible distress.

"Officers are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to effect a arrest," Stiger said. "In this case, I saw Officer Chauvin use a level of force that was not commensurate with the resistance he was receiving."

Stiger also discussed the importance of officer safety and well-being, stating that officers are trained to prioritize their own safety and the safety of others. However, he emphasized that officer safety does not justify the use of excessive force.

The trial has sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform, with many arguing that Floyd's death is a symptom of systemic racism and police brutality. The case has also highlighted the need for greater accountability and transparency in law enforcement.

As the trial continues, the prosecution is expected to call more witnesses to testify about Chauvin's use of force and the events leading up to Floyd's death. The defense is likely to continue arguing that Chauvin's actions were justified and that Floyd's death was not caused by police brutality.

Regardless of the outcome, the trial has already sparked a national conversation about police use of force and the need for greater accountability and transparency in law enforcement. The death of George Floyd has become a symbol of the ongoing struggle for justice and equality in the United States.
