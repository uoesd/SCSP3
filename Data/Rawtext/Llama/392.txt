Facebook Engineer Abused Access to User Data to Track Down Woman, Book Reveals

A new book, "An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook's Battle for Domination," by Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang, reveals that a Facebook engineer abused his access to user data to track down a woman after a vacation dispute. This incident is just one of many cases of Facebook employees misusing user data, with 52 employees fired between January 2014 and August 2015 for similar violations.

According to the book, the engineer located the woman by accessing her Facebook data, including her new hotel's location. Another engineer accessed a date's conversations, events, photos, and real-time location after she ceased responding to him. These incidents highlight Facebook's lack of adequate safeguards to prevent employee misuse of user data.

Facebook granted engineers extensive data access to streamline their work, relying on employee integrity to prevent misuse. However, the book suggests that this approach was flawed, as most misuse cases involved male engineers accessing women's profiles they were interested in.

In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said, "We have a zero-tolerance policy for data access abuse. We've fired every violator and strengthened safeguards since 2015." However, the book suggests that Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, was aware of these issues in September 2015, following a presentation by then-chief security officer Alex Stamos. Stamos proposed significantly reducing the number of employees who could access user data, encountering executive resistance.

Zuckerberg's inherent approach favored data collection growth over privacy, according to the book. This is consistent with Facebook's history of prioritizing user growth and data collection over privacy concerns.

Stamos, who left Facebook in 2018, told the authors, "I wish I had been more vocal. I wish I had been more forceful." His proposal to limit data access was met with resistance from Facebook executives, who argued that it would hinder the company's ability to innovate.

The book's revelations are concerning, given Facebook's history of data privacy issues. The company has faced criticism for its handling of user data, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. The incident, in which the data of millions of Facebook users was harvested without their consent, led to widespread criticism of Facebook's data practices.

In response to the book's allegations, Facebook released a statement, saying, "We take data privacy seriously, and we have implemented many measures to protect user data. We will continue to work to improve our data protection practices."

However, the book's revelations raise questions about Facebook's ability to protect user data. The company's reliance on employee integrity to prevent data misuse has proven to be inadequate, and its history of prioritizing data collection over privacy concerns is concerning.

In conclusion, the revelations in "An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook's Battle for Domination" highlight Facebook's lack of adequate safeguards to prevent employee misuse of user data. The company's history of prioritizing data collection over privacy concerns is concerning, and the book's allegations raise questions about Facebook's ability to protect user data. It remains to be seen whether Facebook will take meaningful action to address these concerns and improve its data protection practices.
