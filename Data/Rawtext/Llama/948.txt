Toomey Faces Censure Over Trump Conviction Vote

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) – U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania is facing backlash from state Republican Party committee members over his vote to convict Donald Trump during the former president's second impeachment trial. The senator's decision has sparked a debate within the party, with some calling for a censure resolution against him.

Toomey, who is not seeking reelection, was one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump of "incitement of insurrection" for his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. The senator has been a champion for conservative challenges within the GOP, but his reluctance to closely align with Trump has made him a target within his party.

"The fact pattern, I think, is pretty damning," Toomey said in defense of his vote. He argued against turning a blind eye when a president attempts illegal and unconstitutional means of staying in power.

Lawrence Tabas, the state GOP chair, is planning a meeting to discuss a potential censure resolution against Toomey. Jezree Friend, a state committee member from Erie County, is among those leading the charge.

"We need to hold our elected officials accountable for their actions," Friend said. "Senator Toomey's vote to convict President Trump was a betrayal of the values and principles that our party stands for."

Sam DeMarco, chair of the Allegheny County Republican Party, agrees. "Senator Toomey's vote was a slap in the face to the thousands of Republicans who worked tirelessly to elect President Trump," he said.

Toomey supporters, however, are pushing back against the censure, arguing that a "Trump litmus test" for loyalty is divisive and damaging. Dom Giordano, a radio host on WPHT-AM, is among those defending Toomey.

"Pat Toomey is a principled conservative who has always stood up for what he believes in," Giordano said. "He shouldn't be punished for having a differing opinion on Trump's role in the Capitol attack."

Despite the backlash, Toomey remains steadfast in his decision. "I understand that not everyone will agree with my vote, but I believe it was the right thing to do," he said. "I hope that my fellow Republicans can understand and respect my position, even if they disagree with it."

The censure vote, while symbolic since Toomey is not seeking reelection, highlights the deep divisions within the Republican Party over Trump's role in the party's future. Toomey's call for tolerance of differing opinions regarding Trump's conduct has fallen on deaf ears, as many Trump loyalists see any dissent as a betrayal.

As the party grapples with its identity post-Trump, the censure vote against Toomey serves as a warning to other Republicans who may dare to challenge the former president's grip on the party. It remains to be seen whether the party will continue to prioritize loyalty to Trump over conservative principles and values.

For now, Toomey remains resolute in his decision, even as the censure vote looms. "I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, not to blindly follow a president," he said. "I will continue to stand up for what I believe is right, even if it means facing backlash from my own party."
