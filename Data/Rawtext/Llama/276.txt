Biden Administration Announces Plans for Convenient, Accessible, and Free COVID-19 Vaccinations for Children Ages 5-11

Washington, D.C. - The Biden Administration today announced its plans to make COVID-19 vaccinations for children ages 5-11 convenient, accessible, and free, pending authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This announcement comes as the Administration continues to make significant progress in its efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, with 2 in 3 eligible individuals, 189 million Americans, now fully vaccinated, up from 2 million at the start of President Biden's presidency.

The Administration is preparing for the potential authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5-11 by the FDA and CDC. Vaccination for children ages 5-11 will depend on the independent FDA and CDC process, with plans to begin shortly after final CDC recommendation. States, Tribes, and territories will play a significant role in the rollout, with federal support including full reimbursement for vaccination operations.

The Administration has procured enough vaccine for the country's 28 million children ages 5-11, pending FDA authorization. Vaccination sites will include doctors' offices, hospitals, pharmacies, community health centers, and school- and community-based sites. Over 25,000 pediatric and primary care provider sites will offer vaccinations, with efforts to increase the number of providers enrolled.

In addition, the Administration has partnered with the Children's Hospital Association to set up vaccination sites in over 100 children's hospital systems across the country. Children's hospitals will work to make vaccines accessible in trusted, family-friendly settings, and provide information to parents.

"We are committed to ensuring that all Americans, including our nation's children, have access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines," said President Biden. "We are working tirelessly to make sure that the vaccination process for children ages 5-11 is convenient, accessible, and free, and that parents have the information they need to make informed decisions about their child's health. We are proud of the progress we have made so far, and we will continue to do everything in our power to protect the health and well-being of the American people."

The Administration will continue to work closely with states, healthcare providers, and community leaders to ensure a successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 5-11. As always, the Administration will follow the science and the guidance of public health experts to ensure the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.

"We are committed to ensuring that all Americans, including our nation's children, have access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines," said Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra. "We are working tirelessly to make sure that the vaccination process for children ages 5-11 is convenient, accessible, and free, and that parents have the information they need to make informed decisions about their child's health. We are proud of the progress we have made so far, and we will continue to do everything in our power to protect the health and well-being of the American people."

The Biden Administration will continue to provide updates on its efforts to make COVID-19 vaccines available to children ages 5-11 as more information becomes available. For more information on COVID-19 vaccines and the Administration's efforts to combat the pandemic, visit COVID.gov.
