Jurors from Derek Chauvin's Trial Speak Out, Describe Experience as 'Life-Altering'

CNN – Minneapolis, Minnesota – For the first time since the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, the jurors who delivered a guilty verdict in the death of George Floyd have spoken out about their experience. In an exclusive interview with CNN, the jurors described the trial as "life-altering" and "haunting," with some seeking counseling and therapy to cope with the emotional toll.

Sherri Belton Hardeman, one of the jurors, said, "It was a heavy burden to carry, knowing that our decision would have a significant impact on so many people's lives."

The jurors were adamant that their verdict was based solely on the evidence presented during the trial, not their personal views on race. "We didn't want to make a decision based on emotions or biases," said Nicole Deters, another juror. "We wanted to make sure we did due diligence and got it right."

Video evidence played a significant role in the jurors' deliberations, particularly the footage of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes. "It was hard to watch, but we knew we had to see it," said Brandon Mitchell, a juror. "We had to make sure we understood what happened."

Jodi Doud, a juror, added, "We took our time, and we didn't rush. We wanted to make sure we got it right, no room for error."

The jury deliberated for over 10 hours across two days before reaching a unanimous verdict. Despite widespread protests framing the incident within systemic racism, the jurors insisted that race did not influence their deliberations.

Lisa Christensen, a juror, said, "We looked at the evidence, and we made a decision based on that. It had nothing to do with race."

Bystander videos were crucial in capturing the events leading to George Floyd's death. The jurors found watching the video of Floyd's death repeatedly to be emotionally taxing.

Sherri Belton Hardeman said, "It was hard to watch, but we knew we had to see it. We had to understand what happened."

The jurors feel an ongoing emotional impact from their experience, with some no longer wanting to see the video of Floyd's death. "It's something that will stay with us forever," said Nicole Deters.
