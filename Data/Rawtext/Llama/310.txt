UK Club Deems $600 Million Compensation Claim for Ever Given 'Exceptionally Large'

CAIRO, May 10 (Reuters) - The UK Club, the insurer for the container ship Ever Given, has deemed the reduced $600 million compensation claim by the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) as still "exceptionally large," a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.

The SCA had initially claimed $916 million in compensation for the six-day blockage of the Suez Canal caused by the Ever Given, but reduced the amount in an attempt to settle the dispute out of court. However, the UK Club believes that the reduced claim is still disproportionate to the damage caused by the ship's grounding.

"The reduced claim of $600 million is still exceptionally large, and we do not believe it reflects the actual damage caused by the incident," the source said.

The Ever Given, owned by Japan's Shoei Kisen, has been held in a lake between two stretches of the canal since the incident in March, with the SCA refusing to allow it to leave until compensation is paid.

Osama Rabie, head of the SCA, said in a statement that there was no immediate prospect of settlement between the SCA and the ship's owner. "We will not back down from our demands for compensation," he said.

The UK Club claims that the Ever Given's owners have not received any evidence supporting the size of the compensation claim. "We have not seen any evidence that would justify such a large claim," the source said.

An Egyptian economic court is scheduled to hold a hearing on May 22 regarding the SCA's claim. The court may authorize the SCA to auction off the Ever Given if compensation is refused.

An Egyptian investigation into the incident found no wrongdoing by the SCA or its pilots. However, Shoei Kisen has already appealed against the ship's detention, but the appeal was rejected by an Egyptian court.

The grounding of the Ever Given has caused significant disruptions to global maritime traffic, with hundreds of ships delayed or rerouted. The incident has also raised concerns about the safety of navigation in the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest waterways.

The dispute between the SCA and the Ever Given's owner has escalated tensions between Egypt and Japan, with both countries calling for a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

The incident has also highlighted the need for more effective safety measures in the Suez Canal, with many experts calling for improved navigation systems and better trained pilots to prevent such incidents in the future.

In conclusion, the dispute between the SCA and the Ever Given's owner over compensation for the ship's grounding in the Suez Canal remains unresolved, with both sides dug in and refusing to back down. The incident has caused significant disruptions to global maritime traffic and raised concerns about the safety of navigation in the Suez Canal. A peaceful resolution to the crisis is eagerly awaited by all parties involved.
