Police Officers Assaulted in US Capitol Riot to Testify Before Congress

In a highly anticipated hearing, a special congressional committee created to investigate the January 6 storming of the US Capitol will hear from police officers assaulted during the incident. The hearing will feature the first public testimony from officers since the event occurred six months ago.

The incident was spurred by former President Donald Trump and claims that the November 2020 election was stolen. Five people died, and dozens of police were wounded during the insurrection.

Maryland Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat on the panel, emphasizes the importance of the officers' testimonies. "These officers put their lives on the line to protect our democracy, and it's crucial that we hear their stories and understand the full extent of what happened that day," Raskin said.

The investigation faces GOP opposition, with House Republican leadership pulling appointments to the panel after Democratic objections. Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed two Republicans critical of Trump to the panel, amid GOP attempts to discredit the probe.

Four police officers are set to testify about their brutal experiences during the riot. Harry Dunn, a Capitol Police Officer, said in a statement, "I want to make sure that the American people know the truth about what happened that day. We were fighting for our lives, and it's important that our stories are heard."

Aquilino Gonell, another Capitol Police Officer, expressed similar sentiments. "We were outnumbered and outmanned, but we fought with everything we had to protect the Capitol and the people inside. It's important that the public knows what we went through."

Michael Fanone, a Metropolitan Police Officer, recalled the violence he faced during the riot. "I was beaten with a flagpole and Tasered. I thought I was going to die. It's important that we hold those responsible accountable for their actions."

Daniel Hodges, also a Metropolitan Police Officer, described the physical and emotional toll of the riot. "I was injured and left with a concussion. The trauma of that day will stay with me forever. It's important that we learn from this and make sure it never happens again."

Republican legislators plan to hold a news conference on the same day as the hearing to highlight the treatment of arrested rioters. Representative Louie Gohmert criticized the investigation, saying, "This is a political witch hunt. We should be focusing on the real issue - the mistreatment of those who were arrested."

However, Raskin countered, "The mistreatment of arrested rioters is a serious issue, but it's not a substitute for a real investigation into the events of January 6. We need to get to the bottom of what happened and hold those responsible accountable."

The hearing is expected to be tense and emotional, as the officers recount the violence and trauma they faced during the riot. It's a critical moment in the ongoing debate over the depth of investigation into the event, with significant Republican opposition.

As the investigation continues, it's clear that the officers' testimonies will play a crucial role in shedding light on the truth behind the US Capitol riot. The public deserves to know what happened that day, and it's up to Congress to ensure that the truth is uncovered.

In a statement, Pelosi emphasized the importance of the investigation. "The American people deserve the truth, and we will not rest until we get to the bottom of this. We owe it to the officers who risked their lives and the families of those who lost loved ones."

The hearing is set to begin at 10 am on Wednesday, and it's expected to be a pivotal moment in the investigation into the US Capitol riot.
