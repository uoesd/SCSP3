Alec Baldwin's Phone Seized in 'Rust' Movie Set Shooting Investigation

Alec Baldwin's cell phone has been seized by authorities as part of the investigation into the fatal shooting on the set of the movie "Rust," according to a search warrant issued by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office. The warrant was sought after Baldwin's cooperation in providing the phone was contingent on a warrant being issued.

According to an affidavit from Detective Alexandria Hancock, Baldwin requested a larger gun for the rehearsal, which led to a discussion between him and Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed via email. The detective believes Baldwin's phone may contain evidence of the commission of a crime.

Baldwin's civil attorney, Aaron Dyer, stated that Baldwin is cooperating with authorities and emphasized the need to protect personal information on Baldwin's phone. "Alec Baldwin is cooperating fully with the investigation, and we are confident that the evidence will show that he was not involved in any wrongdoing," Dyer said.

In an ABC News interview, Baldwin insisted that he did not pull the trigger; he claimed the gun fired when he released the hammer. Lisa Torraco, attorney for Rust assistant director Dave Halls, supported Baldwin's claim that he did not pull the trigger.

The incident resulted in the death of 42-year-old cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuries to director Joel Souza. Detective Hancock stated that discussions about the choice of gun and accessories for the production were conducted through email between Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed.

The search warrant was issued to acquire Baldwin's cell phone for a forensic download to acquire all contacts, text messages, social media accounts, data, and GPS data from the device. The warrant was granted by a judge, and authorities seized Baldwin's phone on December 17.

Baldwin's cooperation with the investigation is ongoing, and he has not been charged with any crime related to the shooting. The investigation is still in its early stages, and authorities have not yet determined the cause of the shooting or who may be responsible.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office said, "The investigation into the shooting on the set of 'Rust' is ongoing, and we are working closely with the district attorney's office to gather all the facts and determine the cause of the incident. We cannot comment further at this time."

The shooting on the set of "Rust" has raised concerns about safety on movie sets and the use of firearms in film production. The incident has also sparked a debate about the responsibility of actors and crew members in ensuring safety on set.

In a statement, the producers of "Rust" said, "We are cooperating fully with the investigation and are committed to ensuring the safety of all crew members and cast on our set. We cannot comment further at this time."

The investigation into the shooting on the set of "Rust" is ongoing, and authorities are expected to release more information in the coming days.

In conclusion, the seizure of Alec Baldwin's cell phone is a significant development in the investigation into the fatal shooting on the set of "Rust."
