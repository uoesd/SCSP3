GUN VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS: MACARTHUR HIGH STUDENT ARRESTED FOR BRANDISHING LOADED GUN

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) – A MacArthur High School student was arrested Thursday morning after brandishing a loaded gun at another student during an argument in the gym locker room. The incident has heightened concerns over school safety and gun control, coming just days after a deadly school shooting in Michigan.

According to Aldine ISD, the student with the gun has since been arrested without any shots being fired. Following the incident, the school was placed on secure status and extra Aldine ISD police officers were dispatched to the campus.

In a statement, Aldine ISD said the safety of students and staff is their top priority and that disciplinary action will be taken according to the district's student code of conduct. The Aldine ISD Police Department is conducting an investigation into the incident.

The event follows a deadly school shooting in Michigan earlier the same week where 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley killed four students and injured seven others. Ethan Crumbley has been charged as an adult, while his parents face charges of involuntary manslaughter for their alleged negligence.

On the same day as the Michigan shooting, another student at Cinco Ranch High School was found with a gun on campus, as reported by Principal James Cross. The student at Cinco Ranch High School was immediately removed from class.

These incidents have sparked renewed calls for stricter gun control measures and increased security measures in schools. In response to the MacArthur High School incident, Aldine ISD Superintendent Dr. LaTonya Goffney said, "We take incidents like this very seriously and will do everything in our power to ensure the safety and well-being of our students and staff."

The incident at MacArthur High School is a sobering reminder of the dangers of gun violence in schools. As schools across the country continue to grapple with the issue, it is clear that more needs to be done to prevent such incidents from happening in the future.

In the wake of the Michigan shooting, President Joe Biden called for stricter gun control measures, including universal background checks and red flag laws. "We have to take action to prevent gun violence," Biden said. "We can't keep letting kids die."

The MacArthur High School incident is a stark reminder of the importance of school safety and the need for increased security measures in schools. As the investigation into the incident continues, it is clear that more needs to be done to protect students and staff from the dangers of gun violence.
