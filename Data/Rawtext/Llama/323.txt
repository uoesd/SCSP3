Suez Canal Blockage: Experts Warn of Prolonged Supply Chain Disruptions Despite Ship's Release

The Ever Given, one of the world's largest vessels, was finally freed from the Suez Canal on Monday, ending a six-day blockage that had brought global trade to a standstill. However, experts warn that the release of the ship will not immediately alleviate the supply chain disruptions that have resulted from the incident.

Douglas Kent, Executive Vice President of Strategy and Alliances at the Association for Supply Chain Management, highlighted the continued backlogs in ports and delivery mechanisms, stating that it will take time to clear the accumulated cargo. "The issue is not just about the ship being freed, it's about the capacity of the ports and the delivery mechanisms to handle the volume of cargo that has been disrupted," he said.

Stephen Flynn, Professor of Political Science at Northeastern University and Founding Director of the Global Resilience Institute, predicted that it will take at least 60 days to normalize the supply chain and address the stress caused by the blockage. "The disruption is not just about the Suez Canal, it's about the entire supply chain, and it will take time to work through the backlogs and restore normalcy," he said.

The Ever Given's extraction was complicated by its massive size, which challenges port capacities and creates concentrated systems. According to Mark Szakonyi, Executive Editor of The Journal of Commerce by IHS Markit, large ships like the Ever Given can cause significant disruptions when they encounter problems. "The Suez Canal is a critical chokepoint, and when a ship the size of the Ever Given gets stuck, it creates a ripple effect throughout the global supply chain," he said.

As of Monday, over 350 vessels were waiting to pass through the Suez Canal, with traffic resumption expected in three to four days. However, shipping agencies caution that it will take months for the supply chain to fully recover from the disruptions caused by the blockage. Some companies have already started rerouting their ships around the Cape of Good Hope, incurring additional costs to avoid further delays.

In conclusion, while the release of the Ever Given from the Suez Canal is a positive development, experts warn that the supply chain disruptions caused by the blockage will persist for an extended period. The incident highlights the vulnerabilities of the global supply chain and the need for greater resilience and flexibility in the face of unexpected disruptions.
