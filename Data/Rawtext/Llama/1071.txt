Renewed Interest in Missing Man Daniel Robinson Case After Gabby Petito's Body Found

The recent discovery of Gabby Petito's body in Wyoming has reignited interest in the case of missing man Daniel Robinson, who disappeared in Arizona in June. Robinson, a geologist, was last seen leaving a job site in the Arizona desert on June 23, driving a 2017 blue Jeep Renegade. His last known location was near Sun Valley Parkway and Cactus Road.

Daniel Robinson is described as 5-foot-8 with black hair and brown eyes, and is missing his right forearm and hand. His damaged vehicle was found on July 19 near a ravine, with personal items inside, but no sign of Daniel. A human skull found on July 31 was not identified as Daniel's, and foul play is not suspected by investigators.

David Robinson II, Daniel's father, has initiated a GoFundMe for a private investigation and search efforts, raising over $34,000. "We just want to find our son and bring him home," Robinson said in a statement.

Private investigator Jeff McGrath, who has been working on the case, discovered that the Jeep was driven 11 miles post-crash, with several attempts to restart the engine. "It's clear that whoever was driving the car was trying to get away from the crash site," McGrath said.

An online petition calling for further investigation by police has amassed over 5,700 signatures. Shayla Davis, a social media user who started the petition, said, "We need to bring attention to this case and make sure that Daniel's family gets the answers they deserve."

Despite the renewed interest in the case, the Buckeye Police Department has stated that they have thoroughly searched and analyzed evidence but found no new leads on Daniel's whereabouts. "We understand the concerns of the public, but we need concrete evidence to move forward with the investigation," a spokesperson for the department said.

The discovery of Gabby Petito's body has sparked a national conversation about missing persons cases and the need for more resources and attention to be devoted to these cases. "It's heartbreaking that it takes a tragedy like this to bring attention to the issue, but we hope that Daniel's case will also receive the attention it deserves," Robinson said.

As the search for Daniel Robinson continues, his family and friends remain hopeful that he will be found safe and sound. "We will not give up until we find Daniel," McGrath said.

The public is urged to contact the Buckeye Police Department with any information that may lead to Daniel's whereabouts. "We need the public's help to bring Daniel home," Robinson said.

The case of Daniel Robinson is a reminder that there are many missing persons cases that need attention and resources.
