Viral Tweet's Impeachment Claims Debunked: A Fact Check

Washington – A viral tweet claiming that a second impeachment of President Trump would strip him of several benefits, including his pension, travel allowance, Secret Service detail, and the ability to run for office in 2024, has been making the rounds on social media. However, a closer examination of the facts reveals that these claims are largely inaccurate.

The tweet in question, posted by a user named @SethAbramson, reads: "If Trump is impeached again, he loses his pension, his travel allowance, his Secret Service detail, and his ability to run for office in 2024. That's not a bad day's work."

However, according to impeachment and political investigations lawyer Ross Garber, Professor at Tulane Law School, "Impeachment alone does not affect a president's post-presidency benefits or their ability to run for office again."

The Former Presidents Act, which governs the benefits provided to former presidents, only revokes a president's pension if they are impeached and then removed from office by the Senate. As Garber explains, "Impeachment without removal from office does not impact a president's pension."

Moreover, the claim that presidents receive a $1 million travel allowance is a misunderstanding of the benefits provided to former presidents. According to Law Professor Stephen Vladeck, "There's no such thing as a $1 million travel allowance for former presidents."

It is also unclear whether a president removed from office would lose lifetime Secret Service protection. While some laws suggest that a president who is removed from office would lose this benefit, other laws seem to indicate that they would still be entitled to it. As Josh Blackman, Law Professor, notes, "The law on this point is murky."

Furthermore, to disqualify Trump from future office, the Senate would need to have a separate vote after a conviction, a process not bypassed by impeachment alone. As Garber points out, "Impeachment and conviction do not automatically disqualify a president from holding future office."

Legal experts are also unsure if the presidency falls under an "Office of honor, Trust or Profit" that one can be disqualified from holding after impeachment and conviction. As Vladeck notes, "This is an open question in the law."

It's worth noting that the travel allowance mentioned in the tweet is actually for former presidents without lifetime Secret Service protection, which does not apply to Trump as he is entitled to it.

In a surprising twist, the person who posted the tweet, @SethAbramson, admitted that the information might be incorrect and was surprised by the tweet's viral success. In a follow-up tweet, he wrote, "I'm shocked this tweet went viral. I'm not an expert on this stuff, and I might be wrong."

In conclusion, while the idea of stripping a president of their benefits and preventing them from running for office again might seem appealing to some, the reality is that impeachment alone does not achieve these goals. The claims made in the viral tweet are largely inaccurate, and the law surrounding these issues is complex and nuanced. It's important to rely on credible sources and fact-check information before sharing it on social media to avoid spreading misinformation.
