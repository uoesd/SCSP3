ECB Joins Global Central Banks in Tapering QE, Lagarde Calls it a "Recalibration"

In a move that was widely expected, the European Central Bank (ECB) has announced that it will begin tapering its asset purchases, joining other major global central banks in reducing or ending quantitative easing (QE). The ECB's decision to recalibrate its asset purchases comes as the bank aims to navigate exiting QE without destabilizing the Eurozone.

According to ECB President Christine Lagarde, the bank's asset purchase rate has been significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's, reaching an average of $181 billion per month. "The ECB's decision to recalibrate its asset purchases is a necessary step in the normalization of our monetary policy," Lagarde said in a statement.

Other central banks, including the Bank of Japan, Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Reserve Bank of New Zealand, and Reserve Bank of Australia, have already started tapering or ending their QE programs. The ECB emphasized that its decision to reduce asset purchases is a "recalibration" rather than tapering, echoing similar stances taken by other central banks.

The Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) will see a "moderately lower" pace of net asset purchases, continuing at least until March 2022, with a balance level maintained at least until the end of 2023. Other ECB programs, such as the Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO III) and the Asset Purchase Program (APP), will continue as planned.

The ECB's total asset balance has reached approximately €8.2 trillion, with a major portion in bonds and loans to banks. Despite the significant size of its balance sheet, the ECB remains committed to maintaining price stability in the Eurozone.

Central banks globally agree that QE programs need to end before interest rates can be hiked to avoid disrupting the yield curve. However, the Federal Reserve is still expanding its balance sheet by $120 billion a month, despite consensus on the need to start tapering this year.

Lagarde affirmed the unanimous decision to recalibrate asset purchases, stating, "We are committed to maintaining price stability in the Eurozone, and we will continue to monitor the economic situation closely to ensure that our policies are effective in achieving our inflation target."

The ECB's decision to join other central banks in tapering QE marks a significant shift in the global monetary policy landscape. As central banks navigate the challenges of exiting QE, their actions will continue to have a major impact on financial markets and the global economy.

In conclusion, the ECB's decision to recalibrate its asset purchases is a significant step in the normalization of monetary policy in the Eurozone. As central banks globally continue to grapple with the challenges of exiting QE, their actions will remain a key focus for investors and policymakers alike.
