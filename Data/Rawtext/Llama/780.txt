Safety on Film Sets: A Concern After Fatal 'Rust' Shooting

The recent fatal shooting on the set of the film "Rust" in New Mexico has sparked concerns about safety on film sets, with some drawing comparisons to Wilmington's past film set accidents, such as the death of Brandon Lee on the set of "The Crow" in 1993.

Charlie Coleman, an on-set armorer, expressed concern over safety on film sets becoming compromised due to increased production demands and strict COVID-19 protocols. "The pressure to meet deadlines and stay within budget can sometimes lead to corners being cut, and that's when accidents happen," Coleman said in an interview.

Following the "Rust" incident, some film productions are reassessing the use of real guns on set, with Coleman's current projects opting for "silent blanks" instead. Silent blanks are blank rounds that do not fire a projectile but still produce a flash and smoke, allowing for a more realistic effect without the risk of accidental discharge.

There's a debate over the necessity of real guns on set, with some advocating for the use of CGI and technology to replace them for safety. However, Coleman emphasizes that while firearms themselves can be managed safely, the human element introduces challenges to maintaining safety. "You can have all the safety protocols in the world, but if someone makes a mistake, accidents can still happen," he said.

Wilmington, a popular filming location, has seen improved set safety since the 1990s, with no major accidents reported in over 20 years. However, historical accidents in Wilmington, such as on the sets of "Maximum Overdrive" and "Cyborg", resulted in serious injuries and legal actions.

The "The Crow" incident remains one of the most known on-set accidents, leading to the death of Brandon Lee. In 1993, Lee was accidentally shot by a prop gun that was improperly loaded with a real bullet, resulting in his death.

An on-set explosion during the filming of "Black Dog" in 1998 caused burn injuries to three people. A less severe incident on the "Iron Man 3" set in 2012 involved Robert Downey Jr. breaking his ankle, delaying production.

Coleman believes that while accidents can happen, they can be prevented with proper safety protocols and a focus on safety. "Safety is everyone's responsibility on set, and we need to make sure that we're all taking it seriously," he said.

In the wake of the "Rust" shooting, film productions are re-evaluating their safety protocols and considering alternatives to real guns on set. While the use of real guns can add authenticity to a scene, the risk of accidental discharge is a constant concern.

The debate over the use of real guns on set is not a new one, with some arguing that the risk is not worth the reward. However, others argue that with proper safety protocols and training, real guns can be used safely.

Coleman believes that the key to maintaining safety on set is a combination of proper training, safety protocols, and a focus on safety. "We need to make sure that everyone on set is trained in firearm safety and that we're following all safety protocols," he said.

As film productions continue to grapple with the issue of safety on set, it's clear that the "Rust" shooting has sparked a necessary conversation. While the use of real guns can add authenticity to a scene, the safety of cast and crew must always be the top priority.

In conclusion, the recent fatal shooting on the set of "Rust" has highlighted the importance of safety on film sets. While Wilmington has seen improved set safety since the 1990s, accidents can still happen, and it's crucial that film productions take all necessary precautions to prevent them. The debate over the use of real guns on set continues, but one thing is clear: safety must always come first.
