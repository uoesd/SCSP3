Facebook Employees Locked Out of Buildings as Apps Experience Worldwide Outages

San Francisco, CA - Facebook employees were unable to access their buildings due to a badge system failure, adding to the company's woes as its apps experienced worldwide outages on Monday. Conference rooms and other internal systems within Facebook were also inaccessible, forcing employees to resort to text messaging and Outlook email for internal communication.

The outages began around 11:45 a.m. ET and affected multiple Facebook apps, including Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Users reported issues on DownDetector, a website that tracks online outages. Facebook acknowledged the outages and promised to resolve the issues quickly, but they remained unresolved at the time of publishing.

The outages coincided with the release of an explosive whistleblower report, which accused Facebook of prioritizing profit over user safety and ignoring warnings about potential misuses of its platform. The report, released by a former Facebook employee, has sparked calls for greater regulation of the tech giant.

As the outages continued, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's net worth took a hit, dropping by nearly $7 billion in just five hours. Facebook's stock also fell by about 5% during the outage period, as investors grew increasingly concerned about the company's ability to manage its sprawling platform.

The outages are the latest in a series of high-profile technical issues for Facebook, which has faced criticism for its handling of user data and its role in the spread of misinformation. The company has faced calls for greater accountability and transparency, and the latest outages are likely to fuel those demands.

In a statement, Facebook said it was working to resolve the issues as quickly as possible. "We are aware of the issues and are working to resolve them as soon as possible," a spokesperson said. "We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your patience."

The outages have had a significant impact on Facebook's operations, with employees unable to access their buildings or use internal systems. The company has not provided a timeline for when the issues will be resolved, leaving employees and users in limbo.

As the outages continue, Facebook faces a critical test of its ability to manage its platform and protect its users. The company has faced numerous challenges in recent years, from data privacy scandals to the spread of misinformation. The latest outages are a reminder that Facebook still has a long way to go in addressing these issues and regaining the trust of its users.
