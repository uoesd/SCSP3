Rick Santorum Walks Back Comments on Native American Culture, Faces Further Criticism

Former Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Rick Santorum faced backlash for his comments about Native American culture during a speech at a conservative youth organization last month. In an attempt to clarify his remarks, Santorum appeared on CNN's "Cuomo Prime Time" with host Chris Cuomo, but his explanation was met with skepticism and further criticism.

During the speech, Santorum claimed that there isn't much Native American culture in American culture. His comments sparked outrage, with many accusing him of trying to erase diversity and downplay the atrocities committed against Native Americans.

Appearing on CNN, Santorum admitted that he misspoke and was referring to the founding of the country and its principles. "I was talking about the founding of the country, and the principles that it was founded upon, and how those principles have been a beacon of hope and freedom for people around the world," he said.

Santorum acknowledged that Native Americans were here and had an impact on the country, stating, "I recognize that Native Americans were here, and they had a culture, and they had an impact on the country. And the way they were treated was horrific."

However, his attempt to clarify his comments did not appease his critics. CNN anchor Don Lemon expressed his fury over Santorum's explanation, criticizing him for not starting with an apology. "You should have started with an apology, Senator," Lemon said. "You should have started with an apology for what you said, and then we could have moved on to having a conversation."

Lemon continued, "But instead, you're trying to explain it away, and it's not going to fly. It's not going to fly, Senator. You have to do better than that."

Santorum's explanation was met with skepticism and further criticism on social media, with many accusing him of trying to downplay the significance of Native American culture and history.

One Twitter user wrote, "Rick Santorum is trying to erase Native American culture and history. He's not sorry, he's just sorry he got caught."

Another user tweeted, "Santorum's attempt to clarify his comments is just a weak excuse. He's still trying to downplay the atrocities committed against Native Americans."

In response to the backlash, Santorum took to Twitter to issue a statement, saying, "I apologize for my recent comments about Native American culture. I realize now that my words were hurtful and inappropriate. I am committed to learning more about Native American history and culture, and I will work to be a better ally to Native American communities."

However, his apology was met with skepticism, with many accusing him of only apologizing to save face.

In conclusion, Rick Santorum's attempt to clarify his comments about Native American culture was met with skepticism and further criticism. His apology was seen as insufficient, and many accused him of trying to erase diversity and downplay the atrocities committed against Native Americans. The incident highlights the ongoing struggle for representation and recognition of Native American culture and history in the United States.
