Riding Out the Storm: Tugboat Crew's Harrowing Experience at Port Fourchon

As Hurricane Ida barreled down on Louisiana's coast, the tugboat crew aboard the Brittany Lynn found themselves in a precarious position. Relief captain Shannon Dryden and his team were unable to leave Port Fourchon before the storm struck, leaving them to face the fury of the Category 4 hurricane head-on.

"We were stuck here, there was no way to get out," Dryden said in an interview. "We just had to hunker down and hope for the best."

Ida made landfall at Port Fourchon with winds of 150 mph and a devastating storm surge. The crew of the Brittany Lynn experienced severe conditions, with visibility near zero and winds that seemed to shake the very foundations of their vessel.

"It was terrifying," Dryden recalled. "The wind was howling, the rain was coming down in sheets, and we couldn't see anything outside. We were just trying to keep the boat afloat and praying that it would pass quickly."

But the worst was yet to come. As the storm raged on, a loose boat crashed into the Brittany Lynn's barge, breaking it free. The crew was in a state of panic as they struggled to secure the barge again.

"That was the scariest moment," Dryden said. "We didn't know if the barge was going to sink or if we were going to lose it completely. It was a huge relief when we finally got it back under control."

The eye of the storm passed, but the crew's ordeal was far from over. They still had to endure the back side of the hurricane, which brought additional challenges.

According to Chett Chiasson, executive director of the Greater Lafourche Port Commission, there were approximately 40 boats with around 300 people at Port Fourchon during the landfall. Despite the chaos and destruction, no major injuries were reported.

"We were lucky," Chiasson said. "Considering the severity of the storm, we came out relatively unscathed. It's a testament to the resilience of our community."

For Shannon Dryden and the crew of the Brittany Lynn, the experience was one they will never forget.

"I would never choose to ride out a storm on a boat again," Dryden said emphatically. "It was a nightmare, but we made it through. That's all that matters."

As the storm subsided and the sun began to shine once again, the crew of the Brittany Lynn breathed a collective sigh of relief. They had faced the fury of Hurricane Ida and lived to tell the tale.

"It was a harrowing experience, but we're grateful to be alive," Dryden said. "We'll never forget this storm, but we're ready to move on and get back to work."
