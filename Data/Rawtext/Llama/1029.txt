Oil Prices Surge as Winter Storms Batter the US

Oil prices reached their highest levels in over a year as a severe winter storm swept across the United States, boosting demand for fuel and power while threatening oil production.

WTI crude futures rose to $60.09 a barrel, up 24% in 2021, and touched a session high of $60.77, the highest since January 2020. Brent crude climbed 1.4% to $63.33, reaching a 13-month high.

The freezing weather across the US has increased demand for power and fuel, with over 150 million Americans currently under some form of winter weather advisory. A major winter storm is predicted to bring heavy snow and significant ice across various regions, posing a threat to oil production.

According to Andy Lipow, President of Lipow Oil Associates, "The cold weather is going to have a severe impact on the oil industry." He highlighted that frigid weather can lead to the shutting in of oil wells due to equipment freezing, and refineries may slow operations and prepare for outages.

The ongoing winter storm has already led to a steady rise in gasoline prices over the last week. "The storm is definitely having an impact on gasoline prices," Lipow said.

The cold conditions are expected to affect oil production in Canada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, and elsewhere. Lipow noted that the storm's impact on oil production will depend on its duration and severity.

Despite the supply concerns, some analysts believe that the current price surge may be temporary. "The price increase is largely a reaction to the weather, and once the storm passes, prices may retreat," said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital.

However, Lipow believes that the current price surge may be sustainable. "If the cold weather persists, we could see prices continue to rise," he said.

In conclusion, the severe winter storm sweeping across the US has led to a surge in oil prices, driven by increased demand for fuel and power and concerns over oil production disruptions. While some analysts believe the price increase may be temporary, others predict that it may be sustainable if the cold weather persists.
