Crew of Ever Given Smile for Group Picture Amidst Ongoing Compensation Dispute

The crew of the Ever Given, the container ship that blocked the Suez Canal and caused a massive disruption to global trade, have posed for a group picture, even as the compensation dispute with Egypt continues. The vessel's blockade is estimated to have caused a daily loss of £7 billion to world trade, and over 400 ships were delayed as a result.

Egypt has demanded $1 billion in compensation for the damage caused by the ship, and has seized the vessel, anchoring it in the Great Bitter Lake. The 25 Indian sailors on board have been stuck on the ship for two months, with no clear prospect of returning home soon.

Union officials in India have expressed concern that the crew may be kept as "hostages" until the ship's owners pay the demanded compensation. However, two crew members have been allowed to leave the ship for personal reasons, and a second master has flown out to join the vessel.

Abdulgani Serang, representative of the National Union of Seafarers of India, emphasized the importance of the welfare visit and conveyed solidarity and support to the crew. "We are with the crew and their families during this difficult time," he said.

The U.K. P&I Club, the ship's insurer for third-party losses, has reported receiving a $916 million claim, which they have described as "largely unsupported." The club has also highlighted the vessel's operational status and the professional competence of the master and crew at the time of the incident.

Legal actions are ongoing, with the ship's owners filing a limited liability suit in London's High Court and efforts being made to settle the compensation dispute. The U.K. P&I Club has stated that they are working closely with the ship's owners to resolve the issue.

The Ever Given's crew members have been stuck on the ship for an extended period, with limited access to basic amenities and communication with their families. The Indian government has been working to ensure the safety and well-being of its citizens, and has been in talks with Egyptian authorities to resolve the issue.

The incident has highlighted the risks and challenges faced by seafarers and the importance of ensuring their safety and well-being. The shipping industry has called for greater support and protection for seafarers, who are often caught in the middle of disputes between governments and ship owners.

In conclusion, the ongoing compensation dispute between Egypt and the Ever Given's owners has left the ship's crew in a state of limbo, with no clear prospect of returning home soon. The incident has highlighted the need for greater support and protection for seafarers, who are often caught in the middle of disputes between governments and ship owners.
