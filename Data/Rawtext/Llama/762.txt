Dolph Lundgren Speaks Out on 'Rust' Movie Set Shooting: Calls for Stricter Gun Safety Measures

As the investigation into the tragic shooting on the set of Alec Baldwin's movie 'Rust' continues, actor Dolph Lundgren has expressed his shock and concern over the incident. In an exclusive interview with Fox News, Lundgren emphasized the importance of firearm safety on movie sets and called for stricter safety measures to prevent such tragedies in the future.

"I was shocked and saddened to hear about the accident on the set of 'Rust,'" Lundgren said. "My heart goes out to the family of Halyna Hutchins and all those affected by this senseless tragedy."

Lundgren, who has starred in numerous action films, including 'Rocky IV' and 'The Expendables,' highlighted the seriousness of firearm safety on movie sets. "We have strict protocols in place for a reason. It's crucial that everyone on set follows these protocols to ensure the safety of everyone involved."

The actor recalled a similar tragedy that occurred during the filming of 'The Crow' in 1993, in which Brandon Lee was accidentally shot and killed by a prop gun. "That incident was a wake-up call for the industry, and it's tragic that we're still dealing with these kinds of accidents today."

Lundgren, who is also a director, revealed that he takes gun safety very seriously on his own sets. "I always practice dry fires, and I expect my crew to do the same. It's crucial that everyone is aware of the potential dangers of firearms and takes the necessary precautions to prevent accidents."

In light of the 'Rust' shooting, Lundgren has decided to use CGI for gun scenes in his upcoming directorial project, 'Castle Falls.' "I don't want to take any chances. CGI is a great alternative that allows us to create realistic gun scenes without putting anyone in harm's way."

Alec Baldwin, who was handling a Colt revolver provided by assistant director Dave Halls, accidentally discharged a live round during a rehearsal, resulting in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. Baldwin has vowed to cooperate with the police investigation and expressed his condolences to Hutchins' family.

Sheriff Adan Mendoza of the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department, which is conducting the criminal investigation, stated, "This is a tragic incident, and our thoughts are with the victims and their families. We will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the facts and hold those responsible accountable."

Script supervisor Mamie Mitchell and set's gaffer Serge Svetnoy, who were both present on the set during the shooting, have filed lawsuits against Baldwin and other crew members. Mitchell's lawsuit alleges that Baldwin recklessly fired the gun without proper training or authorization, while Svetnoy's lawsuit claims that the production company failed to follow proper safety protocols.

Lundgren believes that the incident on the set of 'Rust' should serve as a wake-up call for the industry. "We need to take a closer look at our safety protocols and make sure that everyone on set is properly trained and equipped to handle firearms safely. It's the least we can do to honor the memory of Halyna Hutchins and prevent such tragedies in the future."

In conclusion, the tragic shooting on the set of 'Rust' has sent shockwaves throughout the film industry, highlighting the need for stricter gun safety measures. As actors, directors, and crew members, we have a responsibility to ensure the safety of everyone on set. By learning from this tragedy and taking the necessary precautions, we can prevent such accidents from happening again and ensure that everyone goes home safely at the end of the day.
