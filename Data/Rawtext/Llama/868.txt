Golf legend Tiger Woods is still on the road to recovery after a severe car accident in February left him with significant injuries to his right leg. According to sources close to the situation, Woods' love for his children, Charlie and Sam, has been a key motivation in his recovery process.

The accident, which occurred on February 23rd, left Woods with a shattered ankle and a broken leg. Investigations revealed that he was speeding at 87 mph, over 45 mph above the legal limit, before the crash.

Despite the severity of his injuries, Woods has been making remarkable progress in his recovery, sources say. He was recently spotted without crutches for the first time since the accident at his son Charlie's golf tournament.

"Tiger is very motivated by his children," an anonymous source told Black Enterprise. "He wants to be able to play golf and spend time with them without any limitations. That's what's driving him to push through the pain and discomfort of his injuries."

While there's no confirmed return date for Woods' comeback to the PGA Tour, sources suggest that he has a timeframe in mind. Woods last competed in the PGA Tour at the Masters in November 2020.

"Tiger is taking things one day at a time," the source said. "He's not putting too much pressure on himself, but he's definitely eyeing a return to the golf course in the near future."

Woods' love for his children has been well-documented over the years. He has often spoken about the importance of family in his life, and his children have been a constant source of support and motivation for him.

"Tiger's children mean everything to him," the source said. "They're his world, and he wants to be able to share his passion for golf with them. That's what's driving him to work so hard in his recovery."
