Tiger Woods' Car Crash Investigation Continues, Black Box Data Sought

TORRANCE, Calif. – The investigation into Tiger Woods' car crash on Feb. 23 continues, with Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Johann Schloegl submitting an affidavit for a search warrant to obtain the vehicle's black box. Woods, who was involved in the single-vehicle crash, told deputies he did not remember driving or how the collision occurred.

According to Schloegl's affidavit, Woods repeated his lack of memory regarding the crash at the scene and later at the hospital. The affidavit states, "Woods did not recall driving the vehicle, nor did he recall being involved in a traffic collision."

The black box, also known as an event data recorder, was sought to assist in determining how and why the collision occurred. The device records data such as speed, braking, and acceleration, which can help investigators piece together the events leading up to the crash.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva clarified that the ongoing investigation is not a criminal investigation, but rather an accident investigation. "We're not looking at any criminal activity," Villanueva said. "We're just trying to determine the cause of the accident."

Investigators obtained a search warrant for the vehicle's black box but did not seek a warrant for Woods' blood sample due to lack of evidence of impairment. Villanueva stated, "We don't have any evidence of impairment, so we didn't get a warrant for blood."

Car accident reconstruction experts have suggested that Woods had a "very delayed response" to the emergency, indicating he might not have been paying attention. The vehicle traveled about 400 feet after hitting a median, with no evidence of braking found at the scene.

Woods has a history of a 2017 arrest for drunk driving and was found asleep at the wheel in Florida. However, there is no indication of alcohol or drug use in the current incident.

Woods is currently in good spirits and recovering from a surgical procedure on his back. His agent, Mark Steinberg, released a statement saying, "Tiger is in good spirits and recovering well from his surgery. He's grateful for the support and concern from everyone."

The investigation into the crash is ongoing, with the sheriff's department working to determine the cause of the collision. Woods has not made any public statements regarding the incident.

The crash occurred on the morning of Feb. 23, when Woods' vehicle, a 2020 Genesis GV80, hit a median on Hawthorne Boulevard in Torrance, California. The vehicle sustained significant damage, and Woods was transported to a local hospital for treatment.

Woods, 45, is a renowned professional golfer who has won numerous tournaments, including 15 major championships. He has been recovering from a back injury and recently underwent surgery.

The incident has sparked concern among fans and the golf community, with many expressing support for Woods' recovery. The investigation is expected to continue for several weeks, with the sheriff's department working to determine the cause of the crash.

In conclusion, the investigation into Tiger Woods' car crash continues, with the sheriff's department seeking data from the vehicle's black box to assist in determining how and why the collision occurred. While Woods has a history of drunk driving, there is no indication of alcohol or drug use in the current incident. Woods is recovering from surgery and has not made any public statements regarding the crash. The investigation is ongoing, with the sheriff's department working to determine the cause of the collision.
