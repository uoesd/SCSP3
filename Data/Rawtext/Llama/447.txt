Prince Harry Opens Up About Meghan Markle's Reaction to Bullying Allegations in New Docuseries

In a candid interview with Oprah Winfrey for his upcoming docuseries "The Me You Can't See," Prince Harry discussed his wife Meghan Markle's reaction to bullying allegations that were made against her during her time as a royal. The allegations, which were reported by The Times, claimed that Meghan faced a bullying complaint from a close adviser, which she strongly refuted.

According to Harry, the smear campaign by the media and the firm had a devastating impact on Meghan's mental health. He described how she would cry inconsolably due to the stress and pressure she was under. "The way she was being treated, the way she was being spoken to, the way she was being bullied, it was incredibly hurtful," Harry said.

Despite the challenges they faced, Harry credits Meghan for encouraging him to seek therapy, which he says has had a profoundly positive impact on his mental health and their relationship. "I was stuck in a lot of unresolved trauma and unresolved issues from my childhood," Harry said. "Meghan came into my life and said, 'You need to deal with this. You need to go to therapy.'"

Harry emphasizes the importance of mental health and says that therapy has enabled him to handle anything that comes his way. "It's not a weakness, it's a strength to be able to say, 'I need help,'" he said.

The couple, who resigned as working royals in March 2020, now reside in Montecito, California with their son Archie. They are expecting their second child, a girl, and have ventured into business with Netflix and Spotify, and their Archewell Foundation. They recently celebrated their third wedding anniversary.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said, "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are grateful for the opportunity to share their story and hope that it will help others who may be struggling with similar issues."

The Me You Can't See will be available on Apple TV+ from May 20 at 9 p.m. ET.
