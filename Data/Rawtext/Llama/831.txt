Tiger Woods Survives Serious Car Accident in California, Undergoes Surgery for Multiple Fractures

Golf legend Tiger Woods was involved in a serious car accident in California on Tuesday, sustaining multiple fractures to his right leg. The crash occurred when Woods, who was driving a 2021 Genesis GV80, crossed a median and hit a tree.

According to LA County Deputy Carlos Gonzalez, Woods was "calm and lucid" following the accident, which is remarkable given the extent of the damage to his vehicle. "It's a miracle he survived," Gonzalez said.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva confirmed that Woods' vehicle was traveling at a greater speed than normal, but found no evidence of impairment. "We don't know what caused the accident, but we're grateful that he's alive," Villanueva said.

Woods was conscious and coherent when discovered, able to communicate his name to first responders. Rescue efforts did not require the jaws of life; instead, Woods was extracted with an axe and a Halligan tool.

The crash site, which is known for speeding incidents, has seen drivers caught going up to 80mph. Daryl Osby, Los Angeles County Fire Chief, expressed concern about the frequency of accidents in the area. "It's a dangerous stretch of road, and we've seen too many incidents like this," Osby said.

Public figures like Barack Obama, Serena Williams, and Jack Nicklaus took to social media to express their concerns and well-wishes for Woods. "We're all rooting for you, Tiger," Obama tweeted.

Woods was in California for a TV program and had attended the PGA Tour's Genesis Invitational prior to the crash. The accident drew significant public attention, leading to a second, non-injurious crash nearby.

Woods' surgery was successful, and he is now recovering. His team released a statement expressing gratitude for the outpouring of support. "Tiger is in good spirits and is looking forward to a full recovery," the statement read.

The golf community has rallied around Woods, with many of his fellow players expressing their support. "We're all thinking of Tiger and wishing him a speedy recovery," said Rory McIlroy, a fellow golfer.

The accident serves as a reminder of the dangers of speeding and the importance of road safety. "We urge all drivers to exercise caution and follow speed limits to avoid accidents like this," said Villanueva.

As Woods begins his recovery, the golf world remains hopeful that he will return to the course soon. "We're looking forward to seeing Tiger back in action, but for now, our focus is on his health and well-being," said PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan.

In the meantime, Woods' fans continue to send their well-wishes, eagerly awaiting his return to the sport he loves. "We're all rooting for you, Tiger," said Nicklaus. "You're a fighter, and we know you'll come back stronger than ever."
