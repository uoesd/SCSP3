CNN and Other Media Outlets Sue for Access to Unreleased Videos of January 6 Capitol Riot

CNN – Washington, D.C. – In a push for greater transparency, CNN and a coalition of other media outlets have sued for access to unreleased videos capturing the severe violent crimes committed during the January 6 US Capitol riot. The move comes after the public began to see some of these videos last week, revealing the extent of violence that day.

The videos in question include surveillance footage and body camera recordings from police officers, which the Justice Department and federal courts had not proactively made available, citing security concerns and possible impacts on fair trials. However, Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that the public has a right to see the footage, stating, "The public has a legitimate interest in understanding the actions of law enforcement and the violence that occurred on January 6."

DC Police Officer Michael Fanone, who was injured during the riot, supports the release of the videos, saying, "The public needs to see the truth. They need to see the violence that we faced that day." The videos shown in court have already depicted the crowd's violence, including law enforcement officers being beaten and overwhelmed.

The media coalition, which includes CNN, has pushed for broader access to the videos, emphasizing the role of visual evidence in understanding the crimes committed. Gabe Roth, Executive Director of Fix the Court, said, "The public has a right to see what happened on January 6. It's important for accountability and transparency."

However, not everyone is in favor of releasing the videos. Some defendants are contesting the release, fearing it might affect their fair trial rights. Charles Tobin, an attorney representing some of the defendants, argued, "The release of the videos could taint the jury pool and make it harder for our clients to get a fair trial."

Despite the ruling, more than a dozen video access requests from the media coalition are still pending, with the Justice Department in some cases asking to block rebroadcasting. Drew Shenkman, a CNN lawyer, said, "We're hopeful that the court will continue to side with transparency and allow the public to see the full extent of the violence that occurred on January 6."

In the meantime, investigators continue to seek the identification of more than 250 people believed to have been violent or assaulted police on January 6. Judge Emmet Sullivan has urged the public to come forward with any information they may have, stating, "We need the public's help to bring those responsible to justice."

The release of the footage has renewed discussions around the violence of Trump supporters toward police during the riot. Judge Michael Aloi noted, "The violence that occurred on January 6 was unacceptable, and those responsible must be held accountable."

As the legal battle continues, CNN and the media coalition remain committed to pushing for greater transparency and accountability. The public has a right to know what happened on January 6, and the release of these videos is a crucial step in that direction.
