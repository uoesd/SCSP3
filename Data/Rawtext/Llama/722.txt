Two Farmington High School Students Charged for Alleged School Shooting Plot

FARMINGTON – In a press conference held earlier today, the Farmington Police Department announced that two students from Farmington High School have been charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated battery, a third-degree felony, for allegedly planning a school shooting.

According to Nicole Brown, spokesperson for the Farmington Police, the investigation began when a school resource officer was alerted about the plan by a school administrator. "We take all threats seriously, and we immediately launched an investigation," Brown said.

The investigation uncovered a detailed plan, including a map of the school and a list of supplies for the shooting. "It's disturbing to see the level of detail that these students had put into this plan," Brown said.

Gene Schmidt, superintendent of Farmington Municipal Schools, emphasized the importance of community vigilance and reporting suspicious activities. "We are grateful for the concerned student who reported this plan, and we encourage everyone to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities or concerns," Schmidt said.

Steve Hebbe, police chief of the Farmington Police Department, expressed his gratitude for the collaboration between the school district and the police department. "We are working closely with the Farmington School District to ensure the safety of all students and staff," Hebbe said.

The two accused students, whose names have not been released, did not have access to firearms at their homes. A third student is also under investigation in connection with the alleged shooting plan.

Officials are urging students and parents to report any suspicious activities or concerns. "We want to remind everyone that if you see something, say something," Brown said. "We take all threats seriously, and we will do everything in our power to keep our community safe."

The police department has increased its presence at Farmington High School as a precautionary measure. "We want to assure the community that we are taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety of our students and staff," Hebbe said.

The investigation is ongoing, and officials are working to determine the motive behind the alleged plot. "We are still trying to determine why these students wanted to carry out this act, and we will continue to investigate until we get to the bottom of it," Brown said.

The community is in shock over the news, and many are expressing their gratitude for the quick action taken by the police and school district. "I'm just glad that they were caught before they could carry out their plan," said one parent, who wished to remain anonymous. "It's a scary world we live in, and it's important that we all stay vigilant."

The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of school safety and the need for students and parents to report any suspicious activities or concerns. "We will do everything in our power to prevent incidents like this from happening," Schmidt said. "We are committed to keeping our students and staff safe."

The two accused students are currently being held at the San Juan County Juvenile Detention Center. Their names will be released once they are formally charged.

In conclusion, the alleged school shooting plot at Farmington High School is a sobering reminder of the dangers that exist in our society. It is crucial that we all remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities or concerns to the authorities. By working together, we can prevent incidents like this from happening and ensure the safety of our community.
