ASU Student Protesters Rally Against Kyle Rittenhouse's Admission

Arizona State University (ASU) students took to the streets on Wednesday to protest the possible admission of Kyle Rittenhouse, a 20-year-old man who has been charged with murder and attempted murder for his role in a mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas.

Around 100 students chanted "Killer Kyle off our campus" and questioned how Rittenhouse could be allowed to attend the university while facing such serious charges. Zein Hajaig, an ASU freshman, expressed concerns that Rittenhouse's presence on campus would make students feel unsafe. "I don't think it's right for someone who has been accused of such a heinous crime to be allowed to attend school here," Hajaig said.

However, ASU administration has clarified that Rittenhouse is not currently enrolled at the university and has not gone through the admissions process. In a statement, ASU spokesman Jay Thorne said, "Criminal history is not considered during the admissions process for online classes." Thorne also mentioned that anyone qualified can apply for admission, and a guilty verdict would not prevent Rittenhouse from being a student.

Despite this, student organizations are demanding that ASU prevent Rittenhouse's re-enrollment, denounce white supremacy, and support multicultural spaces. An online petition against Rittenhouse attending ASU has gathered over 15 thousand signatures.

The protest saw an equal number of Rittenhouse supporters, some displaying support for Republican candidates. Former Republican Rep. Matt Salmon criticized the protest, urging respect for the judicial system and the rule of law. "It's important to remember that Rittenhouse has not been convicted of any crime yet," Salmon said. "We should let the legal process play out before making any judgments."

Rittenhouse has expressed a desire to pursue a career in nursing and attend classes on campus in various media interviews. However, it remains to be seen whether he will be allowed to do so.

In conclusion, the protest at ASU highlights the complexities of the American criminal justice system and the role of universities in shaping society's values. While Rittenhouse's fate is still uncertain, one thing is clear: the voices of students and community members will continue to be heard on this issue.
