Unity in Mourning: The Missed Opportunity of Colin Powell's Funeral

The funeral of General Colin Powell, a towering figure in American politics and diplomacy, took place on October 18th at Washington National Cathedral. While his passing was met with widespread tributes and condolences, the private nature of his funeral was a missed opportunity for the nation to come together and reflect on his legacy, particularly in the context of the Iraq War and the current national divides.

Powell, a trailblazing figure as the first Black Secretary of State, was a symbol of the kind of leader traditionally honored with a public mourning ritual in the United States. Public funerals have historically allowed Americans to express collective mourning and reflect on national unity, despite political divisions. However, changes in recent decades have made these rituals more inclusive, honoring Black Americans and women in addition to white male politicians and leaders.

Colin Powell's career and bipartisan respect made him a deserving candidate for a full public mourning ritual. His achievements, including his leadership in the Gulf War and his efforts to promote diplomacy and international cooperation, were widely recognized and respected across the political spectrum. A public funeral would have provided an opportunity for Americans to come together and pay their respects to a man who dedicated his life to serving his country.

However, Powell's funeral did not become a public event, possibly due to his humility, his family's wishes, or concerns over it becoming a political or health risk. The private nature of the funeral limited public involvement and reflection on Powell's legacy, particularly in the context of the Iraq War and the current national divides.

The absence of public mourning rituals for Powell lost an opportunity to honor his contributions and to reflect collectively on the COVID-19 pandemic. Powell's death and its commemoration underscore challenges in achieving unity and bipartisanship in the current political climate. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted deep-seated divisions in American society, and the lack of a public funeral for Powell reflects the ongoing struggles to find common ground and come together as a nation.

In conclusion, the private nature of Colin Powell's funeral was a missed opportunity for the nation to come together and reflect on his legacy. A public funeral would have provided a moment for Americans to put aside their differences and honor a man who dedicated his life to serving his country. The absence of public mourning rituals for Powell highlights the challenges in achieving unity and bipartisanship in the current political climate, and underscores the need for the nation to find ways to come together and honor its leaders in a way that reflects the values of inclusivity and respect.
