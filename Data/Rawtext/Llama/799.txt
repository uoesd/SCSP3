Stimulus Check Update: Millions of Americans Still Eligible for Payments

President Joe Biden has signed the American Rescue Plan Act, authorizing a third round of stimulus checks to help alleviate the financial burden caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has already distributed over 156 million payments, but there are still millions of Americans who have not received their third check.

If you haven't received your third stimulus check, you can check the IRS's Get My Payment tool to see the status of your payment. The tool will also provide information on how to claim the first or second stimulus checks if you haven't received them yet.

To claim the first or second stimulus checks, you must file your 2020 taxes. Line 30 of the 1040 (or 1040-SR) form is used to request any unpaid stimulus payments. The IRS provides worksheets and tax-filing software to help calculate the amount owed.

It's important to note that to claim unpaid funds, you must know how much you have received and how much you are entitled to. The IRS will send a letter if there is a discrepancy between the claimed and calculated amounts.

Stimulus payment adjustments could result in a larger tax refund or reduce outstanding IRS bills. If you have already filed your taxes and discovered that you are eligible for unpaid stimulus funds, you can file an amended return to claim the funds.

The deadline to file 2020 taxes and claim unpaid stimulus funds has been extended until May 17, 2021. This provides an additional two months for individuals to gather the necessary information and file their taxes.

In addition to the stimulus checks, the American Rescue Plan Act also includes provisions for expanded unemployment benefits, small business loans, and funding for vaccine distribution and testing.

The IRS has emphasized the importance of filing taxes accurately and on time to ensure that individuals receive the stimulus funds they are eligible for. The agency has also warned against scams and fraudulent activities related to the stimulus checks.

If you have any questions or concerns about your stimulus check, you can contact the IRS directly or consult a tax professional.

In conclusion, millions of Americans are still eligible for stimulus checks, and it's important to take action to claim the funds you are entitled to. By filing your taxes and using the IRS's tools and resources, you can ensure that you receive the financial assistance you need during this challenging time.
