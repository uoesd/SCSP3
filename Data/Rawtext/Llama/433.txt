Buckingham Palace Responds to Meghan and Harry's Racism Claims, Expresses Concern but Notes Differing Recollections

In a highly anticipated response to the explosive allegations of racism made by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in their interview with Oprah Winfrey, Buckingham Palace has issued a statement expressing the Queen's concern over the couple's experiences and her intention to address the issues privately.

The statement, released on behalf of the Queen, acknowledges the couple's feelings and the challenges they have faced, but notes that recollections may differ. "The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan," the statement reads. "The issues they have raised, particularly that of racism, are concerning and will be taken very seriously."

The statement goes on to emphasize the royal family's commitment to addressing the issues privately, rather than through public commentary. "Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much-loved members of the family, and the family will continue to support them in whatever way they can."

The Queen's response suggests a preference for private engagement with the couple, rather than a public back-and-forth. As Charles Anson, the Queen's former press secretary, notes, "The Queen's approach is always to try to resolve these things privately, rather than through public statements."

The interview, which aired on Sunday night, saw Meghan reveal that she had felt suicidal during her time as a member of the royal family, and that she and Harry had faced racist comments and concerns over their son Archie's skin color. The couple's claims have sparked a wave of public debate, with some expressing support for their decision to speak out, while others have criticized them for airing their grievances in public.

Crisis talks have been held among senior royals and aides in the wake of the interview, with the palace said to be "reeling" from the allegations. According to royal author Penny Junor, "The palace had no advance warning of the couple's claims before the broadcast, and they are still trying to come to terms with what has happened."

Despite the fallout from the interview, the royal family remains tight-knit, with Prince Charles and Prime Minister Boris Johnson both declining to comment on the matter. As Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former spin doctor, notes, "The royal family is a private family, and they will deal with this in their own way."

Public opinion is split on whether the royal family treated Harry and Meghan fairly, with some expressing outrage at the couple's treatment, while others believe they were given too much privilege and support.

The interview has sparked a wider conversation about racism and mental health, with many praising Meghan and Harry for their bravery in speaking out. As the royal family continues to grapple with the fallout, it remains to be seen how they will address the issues raised by the couple and move forward in a positive and inclusive way.
