Stimulus Checks: What's the Latest?

As the pandemic continues to impact the economy, many Americans are wondering if they can expect another stimulus check. Despite a petition calling for $2,000 recurring payments gaining over 2.9 million signatures, a fourth federal stimulus check is unlikely.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki stated, "At this time, there are no plans for a fourth stimulus check."

However, some state governments are stepping in to provide additional financial relief. In California, millions of residents have received a second Golden State Stimulus check of $600 to $1,100. Low-income Marylanders are eligible for direct payments of $300 or $500, while educators in states like Florida, Michigan, and Tennessee have received bonuses.

Advance monthly child tax credit payments of up to $300 per child continue through December, with future aid discussed in federal budget packages. Families qualifying for the expanded child tax credit can receive up to $3,600 per child, with the option to receive payments monthly or in a lump sum.

Third stimulus payments of up to $1,400 are still being distributed, with "plus-up" payments and provisions for new dependents in 2021. California's Golden State Stimulus I and II aim to support low-income residents, distributing one-time payments of $600 or $1,100. Maryland issued payments to individuals and families claiming the earned income tax credit, and provided additional support for the unemployed and small businesses. Front-line workers in Vermont received hazard pay for early pandemic work, and educators in several states received bonus payments.

While the first three stimulus checks reduced financial hardships, current federal proposals do not include further direct payments. However, some lawmakers are pushing for additional relief, citing the ongoing economic impact of the pandemic.

In conclusion, while a fourth federal stimulus check is unlikely, some state governments are providing additional financial relief. The expanded child tax credit and advance monthly payments continue to support families, and third stimulus payments are still being distributed. As the pandemic continues, it remains to be seen if further relief will be provided at the federal level.
