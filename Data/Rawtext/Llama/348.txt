Ever Given: The Cargo Ship Stuck in the Suez Canal and Its History of Spills

The Ever Given, a massive 200,000-tonne cargo ship, has made headlines recently after it became stuck sideways in the Suez Canal, blocking one of the world's busiest commercial sea routes. The ship, operated by Evergreen Marine Corporation on behalf of its owner, Shoei Kisen, has a history of spills, including a notable incident in 1992 when it lost thousands of plastic toys in the Pacific Ocean.

In January 1992, a ship operated by Evergreen and owned by Technomar Shipping spilled 28,800 plastic toys into the Pacific Ocean during a storm. The incident involved the ship Ever Laurel, which arrived in the port of Tacoma, Washington state, a day late from Hong Kong after encountering heavy storms. The spill included 7,200 each of plastic red beavers, blue turtles, green frogs, and classic yellow rubber ducks.

The story of the lost toys and the ship's identity was later discovered through old shipping schedules by Donovan Hohn, who wrote a book titled "Moby-Duck" that covers the true story of the toys lost at sea. The floating toys, known as friendly floatees, have been used by oceanographers to track currents and gain insights into the world's climate. The toys have traveled more than 27,360 kilometers, washing up on many far shores.

Evergreen currently operates a different ship named the Ever Laurel, which was built in 2012 and travels between the Far East and South America. While the company has a history of spills, it is not the only one. Cargo ship spills are relatively common in stormy weather, as exemplified by hundreds of containers lost from the One Apus in December north of Hawaii.

The Ever Given's recent grounding in the Suez Canal has caused significant delays and disruptions to global trade, with dozens of ships waiting to pass through the canal. The ship's operator, Evergreen Marine Corporation, has apologized for the incident and is working to free the ship.

The Suez Canal is a vital waterway that connects Europe and Asia, with over 17,000 ships passing through it every year. The canal is 193 kilometers long and allows ships to travel between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, saving time and fuel by avoiding the need to circumnavigate Africa.

The Ever Given's grounding has highlighted the risks and challenges of maritime trade, particularly in busy waterways like the Suez Canal. The incident has also raised concerns about the environmental impact of cargo ship spills, as the lost toys and other cargo can harm marine life and pollute the ocean.

Evergreen Marine Corporation has faced criticism for its handling of the incident, with some calling for more transparency and accountability in the shipping industry. The company has promised to investigate the cause of the grounding and take steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.

The Ever Given's grounding has also sparked a wider discussion about the safety and sustainability of maritime trade. As global trade continues to grow, it is increasingly important to ensure that shipping companies are taking adequate measures to prevent accidents and minimize their environmental impact.

In conclusion, the Ever Given's grounding in the Suez Canal is a reminder of the risks and challenges of maritime trade, as well as the importance of ensuring safety and sustainability in the shipping industry. While the incident has caused significant disruptions to global trade, it has also highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the industry. As the world continues to rely on maritime trade, it is crucial that shipping companies take steps to prevent accidents and protect the environment.
