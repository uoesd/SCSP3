Ever Given: container ship blocks Suez Canal, causing global shipping chaos

Cairo, Egypt CNN – A large container ship named Ever Given has run aground in Egypt's Suez Canal, blocking traffic in one of the world's busiest waterways. The ship, which is almost as long as the Empire State Building is tall, is causing a significant traffic jam in the canal, with tankers carrying oil from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Oman, and the US among those waiting at both ends.

According to a senior canal pilot at the Suez Canal Authority, the Ever Given, which is flagged under Panama, ran aground due to 40-knot winds and a sandstorm causing low visibility and poor navigation. Eight tug boats are currently attempting to free the 224,000-ton vessel.

The Suez Canal accounts for about 30% of global container ship traffic each day, with nearly 19,000 ships passing through in 2020. The blockage caused by the Ever Given is already having a significant impact on global shipping, with Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, saying that seven of its vessels have been affected.

"It's technically complicated to re-float the ship, and it could take days," the senior canal pilot said. He suggested that the ship is likely to be towed to the nearest parking site for offloading and minor repairs.

The disruption may impact oil and gas flows depending on the duration it takes to clear the container ship. Industry sources suggest that it could be resolved in days rather than weeks, but the situation is being closely monitored.

Tanker Trackers, a ship tracking service, reports that several oil tankers are waiting at both ends of the canal, including vessels carrying oil from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Oman, and the US. The blockage is already causing delays and disruptions to global oil and gas supplies.

The Suez Canal is a vital waterway for global trade, with millions of barrels of oil and gas passing through it every day. The blockage caused by the Ever Given is a significant disruption to global supply chains, and shipping companies are working closely with authorities to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.

The incident highlights the importance of the Suez Canal to global trade and the potential impact of disruptions to the waterway. Shipping companies and industry experts are closely monitoring the situation and working to minimize the impact on global supply chains.

In a statement, Maersk said that it was working closely with the Suez Canal Authority and other stakeholders to resolve the situation as quickly as possible. The company said that it was too early to assess the full impact of the blockage on its operations, but that it was taking all necessary steps to minimize disruptions to its customers.

The Ever Given is operated by the Taiwan-based shipping company Evergreen Marine Corp. The company has not yet commented on the incident.

The Suez Canal Authority has assured shipping companies and industry experts that it is doing everything it can to resolve the situation as quickly as possible. The authority has deployed eight tug boats to assist in the re-floating of the Ever Given, and it is working closely with shipping companies to minimize the impact on global supply chains.
