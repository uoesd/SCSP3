Prince Harry Returns to UK for Prince Philip's Funeral, Pays Tribute to 'Grandpa'

Prince Harry has returned to the UK to attend the funeral of his grandfather, Prince Philip, who passed away last week at the age of 99. Harry is staying at Frogmore Cottage, the home he shared with his wife Meghan Markle before they stepped back from their royal duties.

Due to her pregnancy, Meghan did not receive clearance from her doctor to travel with Harry to the UK. However, the couple revealed in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that they are expecting a girl this summer.

In a statement released earlier today, Prince Harry paid tribute to his grandfather, remembering him for his sense of humor, service, and honour. Harry referred to Prince Philip as 'Grandpa', 'master of the barbecue', 'legend of banter', and 'cheeky right 'til the end'.

The statement also included a personal note, saying Prince Philip will be 'sorely missed but always remembered' by Meghan, Archie, and their unborn daughter. Prince William, Prince Harry's brother, also issued a statement this morning, paying his respects to their grandfather.

Prince Philip is remembered for his long service, being the longest reigning consort to the Monarch, and his devotion to Queen Elizabeth. Harry's tribute ended with a note of thanks and the phrase 'Per Mare, Per Terram', which means 'By sea, by land'.

The funeral service for Prince Philip will take place at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on Saturday. The service will be attended by members of the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles, and Prince William.

Prince Harry's return to the UK comes after a difficult year for the royal family, with the Sussexes' decision to step back from their royal duties and move to Canada. However, the family has come together to mourn the loss of Prince Philip, who was a beloved figure in the royal family and beyond.

The public has also paid their respects to Prince Philip, with tributes pouring in from around the world. The royal family has been touched by the outpouring of support and condolences, and have expressed their gratitude for the kind words and messages.

As the royal family prepares to say goodbye to Prince Philip, they will also be celebrating the upcoming arrival of Harry and Meghan's second child. The baby girl, who will be eighth in line to the throne, is expected to be born in the summer.

In conclusion, Prince Harry's return to the UK for Prince Philip's funeral is a poignant moment for the royal family. The tributes paid to Prince Philip by Harry and William show the deep respect and admiration they had for their grandfather. The royal family will continue to mourn the loss of Prince Philip, but they will also celebrate the new life that is about to join their family.
