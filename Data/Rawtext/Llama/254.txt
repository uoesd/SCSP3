NIH-Funded AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine Shows High Efficacy in Preventing Symptomatic and Severe Disease

Bethesda, Maryland - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced today that AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, AZD1222, has shown high efficacy in preventing symptomatic and severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine demonstrated 78.9% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and 100% efficacy in preventing severe disease or hospitalization.

The clinical trial, funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), enrolled 32,449 adult volunteers across the United States, Chile, and Peru. Of these, 20,000 received the vaccine, while 12,449 received a placebo. The trial was conducted by the COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN), a collaborative effort between NIAID, BARDA, and the World Health Organization (WHO).

According to Ann R. Falsey, M.D., Professor of Medicine at the University of Rochester School of Medicine in New York, "The results of this trial are extremely encouraging. AZD1222 has shown impressive efficacy in preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19, and its safety profile is reassuring. This vaccine has the potential to make a significant impact in the fight against the pandemic."

Magdalena E. Sobieszczyk, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, added, "The efficacy of AZD1222 was consistent across ethnicity and age groups, including participants 65 years and older. No increased risk of thrombotic events or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was found among vaccinated participants, which is an important safety consideration."

AZD1222 uses a non-replicating chimpanzee adenovirus to deliver the genetic code of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human cells. The vaccine was well-tolerated, with no safety concerns identified by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board.

The WHO has recommended AZD1222 for emergency use, and it is currently available in over 70 countries. Participants in the clinical trial will be followed for about two years after their second injection for further study.

In conclusion, the NIH-funded AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, AZD1222, has shown high efficacy in preventing symptomatic and severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Its safety profile is reassuring, and it has the potential to make a significant impact in the fight against the pandemic.
