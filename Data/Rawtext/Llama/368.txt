Facebook's CTO Mike Schroepfer to Step Down, Andrew Bosworth to Take Over

Mike Schroepfer, Facebook's Chief Technology Officer (CTO), has announced that he will be stepping down from his role in 2022. Schroepfer has been with Facebook since 2013 and has played a critical role in the company's development. He will be replaced by Andrew Bosworth, the current leader of Facebook's augmented and virtual reality division.

Bosworth's appointment highlights Facebook's strategic push into augmented and virtual reality. The company has been investing heavily in this space, and Bosworth's work is seen as foundational to Facebook's efforts in building the "metaverse," a digital space that merges the social and physical worlds.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, expressed his gratitude for Schroepfer's contributions to the company. "Mike has been a close friend and a critical leader in our development. I'm grateful for everything he's done for us, and I'm excited to see what he'll do next," Zuckerberg said.

Schroepfer will become a "senior fellow" within Facebook, a new role that will focus on recruitment and AI investments. This move is seen as a way for Schroepfer to continue contributing to the company while also pursuing other interests.

The departure of Schroepfer is the latest in a series of executive changes at Facebook. Recently, David Fischer, the company's Chief Revenue Officer, and Hugo Barra, the leader of Facebook's VR efforts, have also left the company.

Samidh Chakrabarti, a former Facebook director, expressed concern about Schroepfer's departure. "Mike has been an incredible leader and a mentor to many of us. His departure is a loss for Facebook, but I'm excited to see what he'll do next," Chakrabarti said.

Despite these changes, Facebook remains committed to its vision of building the metaverse. Bosworth's work in augmented and virtual reality is seen as a critical component of this effort. Zuckerberg has expressed a vision for Facebook to transition into a "metaverse company," emphasizing the company's future direction.

Bosworth has been with Facebook since 2006 and has been instrumental in the company's efforts in augmented and virtual reality. His appointment as CTO highlights the importance of this technology to Facebook's future plans.

In a statement, Schroepfer expressed his confidence in Bosworth's ability to lead the company forward. "Andrew is a brilliant engineer and a proven leader. I have no doubt that he will continue to drive Facebook's technology forward and help us build the metaverse," Schroepfer said.

Bosworth echoed Schroepfer's sentiments, expressing his excitement to take on the new role. "I'm honored to have the opportunity to lead Facebook's technology efforts. I'm excited to work with our team to build the metaverse and to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible," Bosworth said.

The leadership change at Facebook highlights the company's commitment to innovation and its focus on the future. As the company continues to evolve, it's clear that augmented and virtual reality will play a critical role in its plans. With Bosworth at the helm, Facebook is well-positioned to continue leading the way in this exciting and rapidly-evolving space.
