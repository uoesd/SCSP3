Trump's Social Media Presence Plummets 91% After Ban

In the wake of his ban from Twitter and Facebook, former President Donald Trump's mentions on social media have decreased by a staggering 91%, according to recent reports. The ban, which was implemented in January following the Capitol riot by Trump supporters attempting to overturn the election results, was put in place to prevent further incitement of violence.

Twitter and Facebook's decision to ban Trump was met with both praise and criticism, with some arguing that it was a necessary step to prevent further violence, while others saw it as a violation of free speech. Facebook's Oversight Board later upheld the decision to suspend Trump, citing violation of rules and encouragement of violence.

Despite his attempts to appeal the decision, Trump remains banned from both Twitter and Facebook. In response, he has started a new personal blog to communicate directly with his followers, encouraging shares on Twitter and Facebook. This move comes after he previously communicated with subscribers and followers via email.

Trump adviser Jason Miller hinted at Trump returning to social media with his own platform, aiming to redefine the game. When asked about the possibility of Trump creating his own social media platform, Miller said, "I think that's definitely something that's being considered."

Trump has been critical of Facebook's decision to uphold his ban, calling it a disgrace and an embarrassment to the country. He argues that social media companies should pay a political price for their actions.

In a statement, Trump said, "The fact that Facebook and Twitter have banned me is a disgrace. It's an embarrassment to our country. These companies are run by left-wing radicals who are trying to silence conservative voices."

Despite his criticism, it's clear that Trump's absence from social media has had a significant impact on his ability to reach his followers. His personal blog has not been able to replicate the same level of engagement as his Twitter account, which had over 80 million followers before it was banned.

The decrease in Trump's social media presence has also had an impact on his ability to shape the political narrative. Without the platform of Twitter, Trump has been unable to directly address his followers and influence the conversation in the same way that he did during his presidency.

It remains to be seen whether Trump will continue to use his personal blog as a way to communicate with his followers or whether he will attempt to create his own social media platform. One thing is certain, however: Trump's absence from Twitter and Facebook has significantly diminished his ability to reach and influence the public.

In conclusion, Trump's ban from social media has had a profound impact on his ability to communicate with his followers and shape the political narrative. While he has found alternative ways to reach his audience, his personal blog has not been able to replicate the same level of engagement as his Twitter account. The future of Trump's social media presence remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: his absence from Twitter and Facebook has significantly diminished his ability to reach and influence the public.
