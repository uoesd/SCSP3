Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex: A New Chapter in LA

LOS ANGELES – It's been a year since Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, announced their decision to step back from royal duties, causing a stir within the British establishment. The couple has now settled in Los Angeles, where they're engaging with more sympathetic media figures and opening up about their lives post-royal departure.

In a recent interview with James Corden, Harry cited the British press's impact on his mental health as a reason for leaving royal life. He expressed feeling more comfortable with the depiction of royal life in Netflix's 'The Crown' than in newspapers. This statement comes after Meghan won a privacy claim against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a letter she sent her father.

Buckingham Palace has confirmed that Harry will give up his honorary military titles, and the couple won't return to royal duties. Despite this, Harry and Meghan insist their move does not equate to walking away from public service. They're committed to continuing their charitable work, with a focus on mental health, conservation, and the arts.

Harry's interview with James Corden aired before a scheduled prime-time interview with Oprah Winfrey, where the couple is expected to share more personal details. In the Corden interview, Harry revealed that he's been having Zoom calls with the Queen and Prince Philip, and even shared Archie's first word – "papa." The couple is also expecting a second child, which has heightened interest in their lives post-royal departure.

The couple's move to Los Angeles has sparked a media frenzy, with many speculating about their future plans. While they've kept a low profile, they've been spotted attending events and meeting with various celebrities. It's clear that they're seeking a more relaxed and private life, away from the scrutiny of the British press.

As they embark on this new chapter, it's evident that Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, are determined to forge their own path, one that allows them to prioritize their mental health and personal happiness. While their decision to leave royal life has been met with both praise and criticism, it's clear that they're committed to making a positive impact in the world, on their own terms.

In the end, it's a bittersweet moment for royal fans, who will miss the couple's presence in the royal family. However, their departure has sparked a necessary conversation about the role of the media in the lives of public figures, and the importance of prioritizing mental health. As they begin this new chapter in LA, all eyes will be on Harry and Meghan, eager to see how they'll continue to make a difference in the world.
