Biden Orders Speedy Stimulus Checks for 8 Million Americans

President Joe Biden has issued an executive order aimed at expediting stimulus check payments for approximately 8 million Americans who missed out on earlier rounds of relief. The order directs the Treasury Department to reassess its delivery methods and create online tools and outreach efforts to help eligible individuals claim their missed payments.

According to estimates, 8 million eligible Americans did not receive the first $1,200 stimulus checks from the CARES Act. The Treasury Department has been tasked with addressing this issue and ensuring that all entitled individuals receive their payments.

In a statement, IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig reported that as of last fall, 8 million eligible people had not used the non-filer portal launched by the IRS. This portal was designed to help individuals who do not typically file taxes claim their stimulus checks.

Samantha Jacoby, senior tax legal analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, praised the administration's focus on assisting low-income individuals who missed payments. "The administration's efforts to ensure that all eligible Americans receive their stimulus checks is a positive step towards providing much-needed financial relief during the pandemic," she said.

The executive order is part of Biden's broader efforts to provide financial relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. The administration aims to ensure that all entitled Americans receive their stimulus checks, and efforts to address the issue of missed payments include the IRS launching an online non-filer tool and a media campaign.

While the number of Americans who missed out on stimulus checks could be even higher than 8 million, the Biden administration is working to address the issue and ensure that all eligible individuals receive their payments.

In a statement, President Biden emphasized the importance of providing financial relief to those who need it most. "We must do everything in our power to ensure that all eligible Americans receive their stimulus checks and get the financial support they need during this difficult time," he said.

The executive order is seen as a positive step towards addressing the issue of missed payments and providing financial relief to those who need it most. With the help of online tools and outreach efforts, the administration aims to ensure that all entitled Americans receive their stimulus checks and get the support they need during the pandemic.

In conclusion, the Biden administration's executive order to speed up stimulus check payments for 8 million Americans is a positive step towards providing financial relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the help of online tools and outreach efforts, the administration aims to ensure that all eligible Americans receive their payments and get the support they need during this difficult time.
