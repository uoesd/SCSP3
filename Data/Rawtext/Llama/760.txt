Former Western Actor Turned Armorer Speaks Out on Movie Set Safety After 'Rust' Tragedy

As the investigation into the tragic shooting on the set of "Rust" continues, a former western gunfight actor who was injured by a prop gun is speaking out about the importance of movie set safety. Robert Bradley, who was shot in the leg with a slug from a shotgun during a staged show in Maggie Valley amusement park in 2013, is now an armorer for movies and is working on the set of "Silent Night in Algona" in Iowa.

Bradley's personal experience with a prop gun gone wrong has made him acutely aware of the potential dangers on movie sets. "I was lucky, the slug was too close to my femoral artery to be safely removed, but it could have been much worse," he said in an interview. "That's why I'm so passionate about safety on set. It's crucial that we take every precaution to prevent accidents like this from happening."

Bradley emphasizes the prohibition of live ammunition on set, a rule that he says is non-negotiable. "There's no excuse for using live ammunition on set. It's a recipe for disaster," he said. "I've worked on countless productions and I've never once used live ammunition. There are plenty of alternatives that are just as effective and much safer."

Bradley is currently working as an armorer on the set of "Silent Night in Algona," a Christmas movie filming in Iowa. He's responsible for ensuring that all weapons used on set are safe and properly handled. "It's a big responsibility, but I take it very seriously," he said. "I know firsthand what can happen when safety protocols are ignored. I don't want anyone else to go through what I did."

The "Rust" investigation is currently focusing on the actions of a rookie armorer and the assistant director who handed the gun to Alec Baldwin, asserting it was not loaded. Bradley believes that the person who handed the gun to Baldwin should face charges. "It's simple negligence. If you're going to hand a gun to someone, you better make sure it's not loaded. It's not rocket science," he said.

Bradley stresses that guns should never be pointed at anyone on set, loaded or not. "It's a basic rule that everyone on set should follow. There's no excuse for pointing a gun at someone, even if you think it's not loaded," he said. "It's a matter of respect for your fellow crew members and actors. We all have a responsibility to keep each other safe."

Bradley is paying close attention to potential safety changes on movie sets following the "Rust" incident. "I think this tragedy is a wake-up call for the industry. We need to take a hard look at our safety protocols and make sure we're doing everything we can to prevent accidents like this from happening," he said. "I'm hopeful that we can learn from this and make movie sets safer for everyone."

In conclusion, Robert Bradley's personal experience with a prop gun accident has made him a strong advocate for movie set safety. His emphasis on the prohibition of live ammunition and the importance of proper gun handling is a reminder that safety should always be the top priority on set. As the "Rust" investigation continues, it's clear that the industry needs to take a closer look at its safety protocols to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.
