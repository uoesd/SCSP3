U.S. Service Members, Afghan Civilians Killed in Kabul Airport Attack as ISIS-K Claims Responsibility

In a devastating blow to the United States and Afghanistan, a bombing and shooting outside Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 150 Afghan civilians on Thursday. The Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) claimed responsibility for the attack, which marked the deadliest day for U.S. forces in Afghanistan since 2011.

President Joe Biden vowed retaliation against ISIS-K for the attack, and the U.S. subsequently carried out drone strikes killing top ISIS-K members. The attack came as the U.S. completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan, marking the end of a 20-year war.

ISIS-K is a regional affiliate of the Islamic State and a rival of the Taliban, aiming to establish a caliphate in the historical region of Khorasan. The group was founded by former members of the Pakistani Taliban, the Afghan Taliban, and others, and seeks to establish an Islamic government. ISIS-K is known for its extreme views, especially regarding women and ethnic minorities, and has conducted deadly attacks against civilians.

Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, confirmed the death toll and said that the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber who detonated an explosive device at the airport's Abbey Gate.

"We can confirm that 13 U.S. service members were killed in the attack, and more than 150 Afghan civilians were killed and wounded," Urban said. "The attack was carried out by a suicide bomber who detonated an explosive device at the airport's Abbey Gate. We are still assessing the situation and will provide more information as it becomes available."

President Biden condemned the attack and vowed to bring those responsible to justice.

"We will not be deterred by these cowardly attacks," Biden said in a statement. "We will continue to support the Afghan people and their government, and we will continue to pursue those who seek to do us harm. We will not be intimidated, and we will not be defeated."

The attack highlights the ongoing threat posed by ISIS-K in Afghanistan, despite the group's recent territorial and leadership losses. The rivalry between the Taliban and ISIS-K means that the former is unlikely to offer safe haven to ISIS-K members, and concerns remain about how the Taliban will police ISIS-K and the potential for disruptions in a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.

America's exit from Afghanistan could benefit ISIS-K, despite the group's recent setbacks. The U.S. withdrawal has created a power vacuum that could allow ISIS-K to gain traction and recruit new members.

"The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan has created a power vacuum that could benefit ISIS-K," said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We are concerned about the potential for ISIS-K to gain traction and recruit new members in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal."

The attack also raises questions about the U.S.'s ability to contain ISIS-K and other terrorist groups in the region. The U.S. has pledged to continue supporting the Afghan government and military, but the withdrawal of U.S. troops has limited the U.S.'s ability to conduct counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan.

"The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan has limited our ability to conduct counterterrorism operations in the region," said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We are working closely with the Afghan government and military to ensure that we can continue to target terrorist groups like ISIS-K, but it's clear that the withdrawal has created challenges for us."

In the wake of the attack, the U.S. has vowed to continue supporting the Afghan government and military, and to bring those responsible for the attack to justice. The U.S. has also pledged to continue conducting counterterrorism operations in the region to prevent the spread of terrorist groups like ISIS-K.

"We will continue to support the Afghan government and military, and we will continue to conduct counterterrorism operations in the region to prevent the spread of terrorist groups like ISIS-K," said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We will not be deterred by this attack, and we will continue to work with our partners to ensure the safety and security of the region."
