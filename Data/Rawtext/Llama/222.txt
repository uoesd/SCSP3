Fueling a New Wave of Lawsuits: Ransomware Attacks Prompt Legal Action Against Companies

Eddie Darwich, owner of EZ Mart fuel station in Wilmington, N.C., is taking legal action against Colonial Pipeline, citing lost sales due to the recent ransomware attack that led to fuel shortages along the East Coast. This is just one of several class-action lawsuits emerging against companies like Colonial Pipeline and Scripps Health for damages stemming from ransomware attacks.

Historically, companies have faced lawsuits for cybersecurity lapses, such as Target and Home Depot, resulting in settlements worth millions. However, the rise in lawsuits over ransomware attacks indicates that companies could now be liable for broader damages caused by cybersecurity failures.

"Ransomware attacks are unique in that they can disrupt services beyond just data theft, such as fuel supply and hospital operations," said John Yanchunis, a veteran class-action lawyer at Morgan & Morgan. "The level of cybersecurity measures in companies is often insufficient, and it's time for companies to be held accountable."

The legal and public perception of damages from cyber breaches has evolved, with courts increasingly recognizing the tangible harm they can cause. Settlements are common in these cases as companies aim to avoid costly and long court battles.

"Companies are starting to realize that they can't just sweep these breaches under the rug," said Daniel Solove, a professor at George Washington University Law School and founder of TeachPrivacy. "The public is demanding accountability, and the courts are starting to agree."

The increase in ransomware attacks is a major concern, with discussions on legislative solutions and challenges in achieving fail-proof security systems. "Ransomware attacks are a ticking time bomb, and it's only a matter of time before we see even more severe attacks," said Yanchunis.

In the case of Colonial Pipeline, the ransomware attack caused widespread fuel shortages along the East Coast, affecting thousands of gas stations. Darwich's lawsuit argues that the company's failure to protect its systems and prevent the attack led to significant financial losses for his business.

"I've been in business for over 20 years, and this is the first time I've ever had to deal with something like this," said Darwich. "It's not just the lost sales, it's the reputation damage and the cost of recovering from this attack. Companies like Colonial Pipeline need to take responsibility for their failures."

The lawsuit against Colonial Pipeline is just the beginning, as more businesses and individuals are likely to take legal action against companies that fail to protect their systems. "We're going to see a lot more of these lawsuits in the future," said Solove. "Companies need to start taking cybersecurity seriously, or they'll face the consequences."

As ransomware attacks continue to rise, it's clear that companies can no longer ignore their cybersecurity responsibilities. The legal landscape is changing, and companies must adapt to avoid the financial and reputational costs of a cyber breach.

"It's not just about protecting data anymore," said Yanchunis. "It's about protecting people's livelihoods and ensuring that critical infrastructure is secure. Companies need to step up their game, or they'll face the consequences in court."
