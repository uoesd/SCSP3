Meghan McCain Backs Trump Impeachment, Slams GOP Infighting

Meghan McCain, co-host of ABC-TV's 'The View,' has publicly supported the impeachment of former President Donald Trump, citing the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6 as an act of incitement to insurrection. In an interview with veteran broadcaster Katie Couric, McCain emphasized her commitment to fighting for the Republican Party and identified herself as a lifelong conservative.

However, McCain did not hold back in criticizing the age of current Republican members of Congress, suggesting it impacts their concern for the party's future. "I think there's a lot of old people in Congress, and I think that they're not necessarily invested in the future of the party," McCain said.

The McCain family has a history of conflict with Trump, including public feuds and Cindy McCain's endorsement of Joe Biden in the presidential election. In fact, the Arizona Republican Party censured Cindy McCain for endorsing Biden over Trump in the last presidential election.

Despite her support for Trump's impeachment, Meghan McCain was quick to defend Trump supporters against comments made by Katie Couric, who suggested they need to be "deprogrammed." McCain expressed anger over the implication that all Trump supporters or conservatives are similar to extremist figures such as Marjorie Taylor Greene or Jake Angeli.

"I think it's really unfair to paint all Trump supporters or conservatives with a broad brush," McCain said. "I don't think it's productive or fair to imply that everyone who supports Trump or identifies as a conservative is some kind of extremist."

McCain's comments come as the Republican Party is embroiled in internal conflicts, especially between Reps. Matt Gaetz and Liz Cheney over Trump's impeachment. Gaetz has called for Cheney, who voted to impeach Trump, to step down from her position.

McCain finds the infighting within the GOP entertaining but unproductive. "It's like a soap opera, honestly," McCain said. "I think it's really interesting to watch, but at the end of the day, it's not doing anything to help the party move forward."

Despite the conflicts, McCain remains committed to the Republican Party and its values. "I'm a lifelong conservative, and I will always fight for the principles that I believe in," McCain said. "But I also think it's important to recognize when things aren't working and to try to find a way to move forward in a positive way."

In conclusion, Meghan McCain's support for Trump's impeachment and her criticism of the age of current Republican members of Congress highlights the ongoing infighting within the GOP. While McCain remains committed to the party and its values, she is not afraid to speak out against extremism and to call for a more productive and inclusive approach to politics.
