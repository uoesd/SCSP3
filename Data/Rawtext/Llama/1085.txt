UW Oshkosh Student Claims Giving Ride to Brian Laundrie in Grand Teton National Park

WYOMING (WBAY) – A University of Wisconsin Oshkosh student, Miranda Baker, has come forward with a startling revelation that she and her boyfriend gave a ride to Brian Laundrie, a person of interest in the Gabby Petito case, in Grand Teton National Park on August 29.

Baker shared her experience on TikTok, which prompted her to contact authorities to assist with the investigation. According to Baker, Laundrie offered to pay $200 for a ride for what would be a 10-mile journey, which she found odd.

"He said he had been camping for several days without his fiancée, who was working on their social media page back at their van," Baker said in her TikTok video.

When Baker mentioned they were heading to Jackson, Laundrie urgently requested to be let out of the vehicle. Laundrie was last seen by Baker at around 6:09 p.m. on August 29, seeking another ride at Jackson Dam, near Colter Bay.

Laundrie returned to his home in North Port, Florida, on September 1, while Gabby Petito's family reported her missing on September 11. Laundrie has not cooperated with authorities in the investigation.

The development comes after a domestic violence incident involving Petito and Laundrie was reported in Utah on August 12, captured on bodycam footage, with no charges filed.

Baker's revelation has sparked renewed interest in the case, with many questioning Laundrie's involvement in Petito's disappearance and death.

"I just wanted to share my experience because I saw him on the news and I was like, 'Wait a minute, that's the guy we picked up,'" Baker said in her TikTok video.

The FBI and local authorities have been investigating Petito's disappearance and death, with Laundrie identified as a person of interest.

Petito's body was believed to have been found on September 19, sparking a nationwide search for Laundrie.

As the investigation continues, Baker's account has raised questions about Laundrie's whereabouts and activities in the days leading up to Petito's disappearance.

The case has gripped the nation, with many calling for justice for Gabby Petito.

In the wake of Baker's revelation, authorities are urging anyone with information about Laundrie's whereabouts or activities to come forward.

The investigation into Gabby Petito's disappearance and death continues, with Brian Laundrie remaining a person of interest.

As the search for answers continues, Miranda Baker's account serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and the role that ordinary citizens can play in solving crimes.
