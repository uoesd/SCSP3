Biden's Inauguration: A Scaled-Back, Virtual Affair Due to COVID-19 and Security Concerns

President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration is set to be a historic event, albeit a scaled-back and heavily virtual one, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and security concerns. The ceremony, which will take place on January 20th, will be markedly different from previous inaugurations, with a focus on virtual events and limited in-person attendance.

More than 25,000 National Guard soldiers have been deployed in Washington, D.C., to ensure security following the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The heightened security measures have prompted changes to Biden's travel plans and the postponement of the inauguration rehearsal.

In place of the traditional black-tie inaugural balls, a star-studded virtual concert hosted by Tom Hanks will be held. The concert, titled "Celebrating America," will feature performances by Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, and other notable artists. The event will be broadcast live on television and streaming platforms, allowing Americans to participate in the celebration from the safety of their own homes.

A memorial for coronavirus victims and several days of virtual programming will precede the inauguration. The memorial will honor the lives lost to the pandemic and serve as a reminder of the ongoing struggle against the virus. The virtual programming will include a variety of events, such as panel discussions and performances, aimed at engaging Americans and promoting unity.

The National Mall will be closed to the public, and crowd size at the inauguration will be significantly reduced, with about 1,000 guests expected. Former Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton, along with former First Ladies, will attend the ceremony, while former President Trump has declined to participate.

Following the inauguration, Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will participate in a Pass in Review, a visit to Arlington National Cemetery, and a virtual parade. The virtual parade will feature performances and remarks from Biden and Harris, replacing the traditional in-person parade.

Lady Gaga will sing the National Anthem at the ceremony, while Jennifer Lopez will perform a musical number. The "Celebrating America" TV special will feature additional performances and remarks from Biden and Harris, providing an opportunity for Americans to come together and celebrate the new administration.

Despite the scaled-back nature of the inauguration, the event promises to be a momentous occasion, marking a new chapter in American history. With its focus on virtual events and limited in-person attendance, the inauguration will serve as a testament to the resilience and adaptability of the American people in the face of adversity.
