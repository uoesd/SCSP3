Tragedy in Kabul: 13 US Troops Among Nearly 200 Killed in ISIS-K Suicide Bombing

The attack on the Kabul airport in Afghanistan has left nearly 200 people dead, including 13 American troops, in what President Joe Biden has described as a "senseless act of violence." The suicide bombing, claimed by ISIS-K, also took the lives of at least 170 Afghans, two Brits, and the child of a British citizen.

The 13 American service members killed in the attack were part of a dangerous mission, according to President Biden, who described them as "heroes." Among the victims were 11 Marines, an Army soldier, and a Navy medic.

Adm. Mike Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations, praised the courage of the service members, saying their sacrifice was representative of American ideals. "Their bravery and selflessness are an inspiration to us all," he said.

One of the American victims, Navy Corpsman Maxton Soviak, 22, was recognized for his proud service and aspired to make the Navy a lifelong career. His mother, Rachel Soviak, said in a statement, "Maxton was an amazing young man who loved his country and was dedicated to serving others."

Marine Corps Lance Cpl. David Espinoza, 20, was remembered for embodying American values like dedication and service. "David was a shining example of what it means to be an American," said Rep. Henry Cuellar (Texas).

Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum, 20, was about to become a father, with a deep commitment to the Marines. His sister, Cheyenne McCollum, said, "Rylee was so excited to start his family and continue serving his country."

Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Kareem Nikoui, 20, had a lifelong aspiration to serve in the Marine Corps, according to his father, Steve Nikoui. "Kareem was passionate about serving his country and was proud to be a Marine," he said.

Marine Corps Cpl. Hunter Lopez, 22, son of two sheriff's department members, planned to become a deputy post-deployment. "Hunter was a fine young man who wanted to follow in his parents' footsteps and serve his community," said Sheriff Chad Bianco (Riverside County Sheriff's Department, California).

The attack has sparked outrage and grief across the nation, with lawmakers and community leaders calling for unity and support for the families of the victims. "Our hearts go out to the families of these brave service members who made the ultimate sacrifice," said Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.).

In the wake of the tragedy, Principal Armando Salazar (Lyndon B. Johnson High School) reflected on the sacrifices made by the service members. "These young men and women gave their lives for our freedom, and we will never forget their service and sacrifice," he said.

As the nation mourns the loss of these heroes, their families and loved ones are left to pick up the pieces and carry on their legacy. "We will always remember these brave service members who gave their lives for our country," said Jim McCollum, father of Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum. "Their sacrifice will never be forgotten."
