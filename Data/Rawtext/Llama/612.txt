The Politics of Style: Kamala Harris's Vogue Cover and the Erasure of Black Women's Identities

The recent controversy surrounding Vice President Kamala Harris's appearance on the cover of Vogue magazine has sparked a necessary conversation about the politicization of Black women's bodies in public spheres. Harris, the first Black woman to hold the office of Vice President, was featured on the February cover of Vogue in a casual attire, prompting critics to argue that the cover failed to appropriately reflect her historic role. In response, Vogue announced a limited edition re-do cover, featuring Harris in a more formal setting.

The controversy surrounding Harris's Vogue cover is rooted in the racial and gendered significance of Black women's styling choices. Black women in politics navigate complex relationships between their appearance, cultural norms, and Euro-American beauty standards. Harris's decision to wear her own clothes for the shoot, which included cultural symbols significant to Black American culture, such as her sorority's colors, was an attempt to connect with Black communities. However, the cover was accused of white-washing Harris's skin tone, demonstrating racial bias in photography and the issue of colorism.

Anna Wintour, Editor-in-Chief of Vogue, stated that the magazine's decision to feature Harris in a casual setting was an attempt to reflect her personal style, captured by Tyler Mitchell, the first Black photographer for a Vogue cover. However, the controversy surrounding the cover highlights the ways in which Black women's beauty and electoral appeal are often tied to Eurocentric norms, affecting their representation even within majority Black districts.

The discussion around Harris's Vogue cover underlines the politicization of Black women's bodies in public spheres, focusing more on their physical appearance than politics. This is not a new phenomenon, as Black women have historically been subjected to scrutiny and criticism over their appearance, with their hair, skin tone, and body shape being policed and judged. The erasure of Black women's identities is a persistent issue, and it is crucial that we acknowledge and address it.

In conclusion, the controversy surrounding Kamala Harris's Vogue cover is a reminder of the ways in which Black women's bodies are politicized and scrutinized in public spheres. It is essential that we recognize and challenge the racial and gendered biases that underlie these criticisms, and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where Black women's identities are valued and respected.
