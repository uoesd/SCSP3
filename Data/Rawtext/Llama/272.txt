WHO Update on COVID-19 Vaccines and Children: Prioritizing Protection for the Most Vulnerable

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect communities worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) is committed to keeping children and adolescents safe and healthy. In recent months, several COVID-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorization for use in children, and the WHO is working tirelessly to ensure that these vaccines are available to those who need them most.

The greatest burden of COVID-19 remains among older persons and those with comorbidities. The WHO prioritizes vaccination for these groups, as they are at a higher risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. However, children and adolescents are not immune to the virus, and it is important to take measures to protect them as well.

Children and adolescents generally experience milder symptoms of COVID-19 compared to adults. However, children under the age of five years have a higher risk of diseases with symptoms similar to COVID-19, such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Additionally, children and adolescents can experience 'long COVID-19' and a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome (PIMS-TS/MIS-C) post-infection.

Risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children include older age, obesity, and preexisting conditions. It is important for parents and caregivers to be aware of these risk factors and to take steps to reduce the risk of severe illness in their children.

Evidence suggests that there may be a larger impact of paediatric COVID-19 related fatality in low to middle income countries. The WHO is working closely with these countries to ensure that they have access to the necessary resources and support to protect children and adolescents from COVID-19.

Studies on the role of children and adolescents in COVID-19 transmission have produced mixed results. While some studies suggest that children may be less infectious than adolescents and adults, others have found that children can still transmit the virus. The WHO is continuing to monitor the situation and provide guidance based on the latest scientific evidence.

The socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and response on children and adolescents is significant. School closures, social distancing measures, and other restrictions have affected children's education, socialization, and mental health. The WHO is working with governments, civil society, and other stakeholders to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on children and adolescents.

In conclusion, the WHO is committed to protecting children and adolescents from COVID-19. We are working tirelessly to ensure that vaccines are available to those who need them most, and we are providing guidance and support to parents, caregivers, and governments to help reduce the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as new information becomes available.
