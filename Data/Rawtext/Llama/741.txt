Safety Concerns and Tragic Accident on the Set of "Rust"

Lane Luper, a former camera assistant on the movie "Rust," has come forward with concerns about safety on the set before the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Luper quit his job just hours before the tragic incident, citing lax COVID policies, poor housing situations, and specifically gun safety concerns in his resignation letter.

"I couldn't keep quiet anymore," Luper said in an interview. "I had to speak up about the safety issues on set. I didn't want anyone to get hurt, and unfortunately, my worst fears came true."

On October 21st, actor Alec Baldwin discharged a prop gun, resulting in the death of Hutchins and injury of director Joel Souza. The incident has sparked an investigation and raised questions about safety protocols on film sets.

Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza confirmed that a real bullet was loaded in the firearm Baldwin used. "We're still trying to figure out how that happened," he said.

Assistant director David Halls, who declared the gun "cold," claimed ignorance of live rounds in the weapon. "I don't know where the live rounds came from," he said.

The film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, is under scrutiny but denies knowing the source of live rounds. "I don't know anything about the live rounds," she said. "I'm cooperating fully with the investigation."

Investigators found three guns and about 500 rounds of ammunition, including live rounds, on set. The Santa Fe District Attorney, Mary Carmack-Altwies, has not ruled out charges against anyone involved in the incident.

"We're taking this investigation very seriously," Carmack-Altwies said. "We're looking at all aspects of the production and talking to everyone involved. We want to make sure that something like this never happens again."

Luper's resignation letter, obtained by ABC News, details his concerns about safety on set. "I'm tired of being a part of a production that doesn't seem to care about safety," he wrote. "I've seen multiple instances of unsafe behavior, and I can't keep quiet about it anymore."

Luper's concerns were echoed by other crew members who walked off the set in protest of working conditions hours before Hutchins was killed. "We were all worried about safety," said one crew member, who wished to remain anonymous. "We didn't feel like our concerns were being taken seriously."

"Rust" producers have denied Luper's claims about ignoring safety concerns and budget issues. "We take safety very seriously on set," said a spokesperson for the production company. "We're cooperating fully with the investigation and will do everything we can to ensure that something like this never happens again."

The tragic accident on the set of "Rust" has sparked a larger conversation about safety protocols on film sets. Many in the industry are calling for stricter safety regulations and better training for crew members.

"This is a wake-up call for the industry," said one filmmaker, who wished to remain anonymous. "We need to take safety more seriously and make sure that everyone on set is trained properly."

As the investigation into the accident continues, the film industry is reeling from the loss of one of its own. Halyna Hutchins was a talented cinematographer and a beloved member of the film community. Her death is a tragic reminder of the importance of safety on set.

"We're heartbroken by Halyna's death," said a spokesperson for the Directors Guild of America. "We're working closely with the investigation and urging everyone in the industry to take safety protocols seriously."

The accident on the set of "Rust" has sent shockwaves through the film industry, highlighting the need for better safety protocols and greater accountability. As the investigation continues, one thing is clear: the loss of Halyna Hutchins is a tragedy that will have a lasting impact on the industry.
