Stimulus Payments: What You Need to Know

Washington CNN – The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has sent out over 100 million stimulus payments worth $600 each to eligible Americans, as approved by Congress. The payments aim to provide financial relief to individuals and families affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The IRS has made the payments through direct deposit, paper checks, or prepaid debit cards. In fact, over 8 million debit cards have been distributed, and the IRS warns recipients to watch for them, as some may mistake them for junk mail.

The debit cards come in a white envelope with the Treasury Department seal and are issued by MetaBank. Recipients can use the card for purchases, ATM withdrawals, and transferring funds without incurring any fees.

To be eligible for the full payment, individuals must earn less than $75,000, and couples must earn less than $150,000. The payment phases out at $87,000 for single filers and $174,000 for joint filers without children.

Unfortunately, undocumented immigrants without Social Security numbers are ineligible for the payments. However, their spouses and children can receive payments if they have SSNs. Dependents, such as some college students, are also ineligible for the payments.

To check the status of their payment, individuals can use the IRS's Get My Payment online tool. The tool allows users to track their payment and see when it will be deposited into their account or mailed to them.

The IRS urges recipients to be cautious when receiving their debit cards and to carefully read the instructions on how to activate and use them. They should also be aware of potential scams and not give out their personal information to anyone claiming to be from the IRS.

In conclusion, the stimulus payments aim to provide much-needed financial relief to millions of Americans affected by the pandemic. Eligible individuals can expect to receive their payments through various methods, including direct deposit, paper checks, or prepaid debit cards. It is essential to be aware of the payment eligibility criteria and to watch for the debit cards, as some may mistake them for junk mail. Recipients should also be cautious when using their debit cards and protect their personal information to avoid potential scams.
