Hurricane Ida's Remnants Wreak Havoc in Mid-Atlantic States

NEW YORK (AP) – The remnants of Hurricane Ida brought chaos and destruction to the mid-Atlantic states, causing at least two tornadoes, heavy winds, and drenching rains. The storm's impact was felt across several states, including New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia.

In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency in all 21 counties, urging people to stay off flooded roads. Sgt. Chris Levchak, a police sergeant in Lodi, described the situation as "dangerous" and advised residents to stay indoors. "We've had reports of cars submerged in water, and we're urging people to avoid traveling unless absolutely necessary," he said.

In Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, Fire Chief Scott Goldstein reported that thousands were evacuated due to dangerous levels at a dam near Johnstown, known as "Flood City." "We're taking this situation very seriously, and we're working closely with emergency management officials to ensure everyone's safety," he said.

New York's Central Park recorded 3.15 inches of rain in one hour, breaking the previous record set by Tropical Storm Henri. The heavy rains caused widespread flooding, submerging cars and roads, and prompting the suspension of all flights and train service at Newark Liberty International Airport. Subway stations and tracks in New York were also severely flooded, leading the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to suspend all service.

In addition to the flooding, at least two tornadoes touched down in the mid-Atlantic region. One tornado ripped through parts of Delaware, causing significant damage to homes and businesses. Another tornado was reported in Maryland, where it destroyed several buildings and left many without power.

The storm also affected Maryland and Virginia, resulting in at least one death and significant property damage. In Virginia, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her car, and in Maryland, several buildings were destroyed by the tornado.

As the mid-Atlantic states continued to grapple with the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, Tropical Storm Larry was forming off the coast of Africa, anticipated to become a major hurricane by Saturday. The National Hurricane Center warned that Larry could bring dangerous winds, storm surges, and heavy rainfall to the eastern United States.

In the wake of the storm, emergency management officials urged residents to remain vigilant and prepared for potential flooding and power outages. The Wilmore and Hinckston Run Dams in Pennsylvania were monitored for stability due to high-hazard conditions, and residents living downstream were advised to be ready to evacuate if necessary.

Overall, Hurricane Ida's remnants caused significant damage and disruption across the mid-Atlantic states, leaving many residents stranded, without power, and facing a long recovery ahead.
