YouTube Suspends Trump's Channel, Disables Comments Indefinitely as Tech Companies Crack Down on Misinformation

In the wake of the US Capitol riot, YouTube has taken the unprecedented step of suspending President Trump's channel for at least a week, citing concerns over the "ongoing potential for violence." The video-sharing platform has also disabled all comments on Trump's channel indefinitely.

The move comes as tech companies scramble to prevent the spread of misinformation and exploitation of the Capitol siege. Twitter has permanently banned Trump, while Facebook has banned him at least until President-elect Biden's inauguration.

Jim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media, called YouTube's action an "important and necessary first step" and suggested it should become permanent. "The President's use of social media to incite violence and spread hate has had devastating consequences," Steyer said in a statement. "YouTube's decision to suspend his channel is a recognition of the ongoing risk he poses to our democracy and the safety of our citizens."

Google, YouTube's parent company, has also announced a pause on political ads on its platforms until after Inauguration Day. "We're temporarily pausing political ads on our platforms to prevent the spread of misinformation and exploitation of the Capitol siege," a Google spokesperson said.

Meanwhile, Parler, a social media platform popular with conservatives, has found itself in hot water after being removed by Amazon Web Services and app stores. The platform has registered its domain with Epik, a company known for hosting far-right services. Parler is suing Amazon for alleged antitrust violations over its expulsion.

In other tech and media news, Apple has announced new projects related to its $100 million pledge for racial equity and justice. Lars Lehne has been named group CEO of Incubeta, and Julie Eddleman has joined DoubleVerify as EVP and global chief commercial officer.

As tech companies continue to grapple with the fallout from the Capitol siege, it remains to be seen how they will balance free speech with the need to protect their users from harmful content. But for now, it's clear that they're taking steps to prevent further violence and misinformation from spreading on their platforms.

"The safety of our users and the integrity of our platform are our top priorities," a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely and take appropriate action as needed."
