Deadly Kabul School Bombing Fuels Fears of Hazara Community's Vulnerability

KABUL – A devastating bombing at a school in Kabul's predominantly Hazara neighborhood of Hazara has left more than 85 people dead, mostly students, and stunned both Afghans and the international community. The attack has heightened fears among Afghanistan's Hazara community about their vulnerability amid the withdrawal of international forces.

The victims were predominantly schoolgirls aged 13 to 18, a demographic that has been disproportionately affected by the conflict in Afghanistan. Mukhtar Alizada, whose sister Nekbakht was killed in the bombing, shared her passion for education and aspirations for a better life. "Nekbakht wanted to become a doctor and serve her community," Alizada said. "She was always determined to succeed, despite the challenges we face as Hazaras."

Many Hazaras feel abandoned as U.S. and NATO troops withdraw, fearing a return to persecution and increased attacks. The community has historically faced discrimination and violence in Afghanistan, and the withdrawal of foreign forces has raised concerns about their safety. "We feel like we're being left behind," said Mohammad Hedayt, spokesman for Vice President Sarwar Danish. "The international community is abandoning us, and we're worried about what will happen next."

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Afghan President Ashraf Ghani blamed the Taliban. The Islamic State has previously claimed responsibility for attacks targeting civilians in western Kabul, home to many Hazaras and Shiites. Experts warn that the withdrawal of foreign forces could create instability, allowing groups like the Islamic State to grow stronger.

Despite the risks, Nekbakht's family is determined to continue educating their children, viewing it as the only path to a better future. "We won't let fear stop us," Alizada said. "We'll keep fighting for our rights and for a better life for our children."

The attack has sparked outrage and grief across Afghanistan and the world. The United Nations Special Representative for Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, condemned the attack, saying, "This heinous act is a reminder of the devastating consequences of violence and conflict, and the need for all parties to work towards peace and stability in Afghanistan."

The bombing has also raised questions about the future of peace negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government. An intense diplomatic push for a peace deal has so far been unsuccessful, and the attack has highlighted the challenges facing the negotiations. "The bombing is a stark reminder of the urgent need for peace in Afghanistan," said a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department. "We continue to support the Afghan-led peace process and urge all parties to work towards a political settlement."

The attack has also underscored the importance of education in Afghanistan. The Hazara community has long valued education as a means of achieving a better life, and the bombing has only strengthened their resolve. "Education is the key to our future," Alizada said. "We won't let fear stop us from pursuing our dreams."

In the aftermath of the attack, Afghans have come together to mourn the victims and demand justice. Protests have erupted in Kabul and other cities, with demonstrators calling for greater security and accountability. "We demand justice for the victims of the bombing," said one protester. "We won't let our children be killed without a fight."

The bombing has also highlighted the need for greater protection of civilians in Afghanistan. The United Nations has called for increased efforts to protect civilians, particularly children, who are disproportionately affected by the conflict. "The attack is a stark reminder of the need for all parties to take all feasible precautions to protect civilians, particularly children, from the effects of conflict," said a spokesperson for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

As the people of Afghanistan continue to mourn the victims of the bombing, the international community has reiterated its commitment to supporting peace and stability in the country. The attack has underscored the urgent need for a political settlement and greater efforts to protect civilians. "We stand with the people of Afghanistan in their quest for peace and stability," said a spokesperson for the European Union. "We will continue to support their efforts to build a better future for all Afghans."

In the face of such tragedy, the resilience and determination of the Hazara community are a testament to the strength and courage of the Afghan people. Despite the challenges they face, they remain committed to education and a better future for their children. As Alizada said, "We won't let fear stop us. We'll keep fighting for our rights and for a better life for our children."
