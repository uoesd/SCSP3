Brady Impresses Arians with Full-Speed Return to Practice

Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians has been impressed with Tom Brady's full-speed return to practice, following minor knee surgery after leading the team to a Super Bowl title in February. Despite the surgery, Brady is almost at 100 percent, participating fully in the team's first minicamp practice.

"I was a little surprised that he was cleared fully for practice, but he's been working out like a maniac," Arians said. "He's been organizing team workouts and he's been doing a great job."

Brady, who will turn 44 in August, has been eager to get back on the field and has been putting in extra work to ensure he's ready for the upcoming season.

"I'm feeling great, I'm feeling healthy," Brady said. "I'm just excited to be back out here with my teammates and get ready for the season."

Arians acknowledges the challenge in trying to limit Brady's practice time due to his eagerness.

"It's hard to hold him back, but we have to be smart about it," Arians said. "We don't want to overdo it and have him out there for too long, but he's looking good."

Brady's performance potential for the upcoming season, following his successful 2020 season, is highlighted. Entering Year 2 with the Bucs, Brady's understanding of the offensive system is expected to improve, making him and his receivers more dangerous.

"I think we're all feeling more comfortable with the system now," receiver Chris Godwin said. "We've got a better understanding of what Tom wants and what he's looking for, so I think that's going to make us more dangerous."

Godwin notes improved timing and understanding between Brady and the receivers.

"We're all on the same page now, we know what to expect from each other," Godwin said. "It's going to be a fun season."

With Brady back and healthy, the Buccaneers are looking to build on their Super Bowl victory and make a deep playoff run.

"We've got a lot of work to do, but we're excited about the potential," Arians said. "We've got a good team, we've just got to put it all together."

The Buccaneers will continue their minicamp practices this week, with Brady expected to participate fully.

"I'm just excited to be back out here with my teammates and get ready for the season," Brady said. "We've got a lot of work to do, but we're all looking forward to the challenge."
