Pro-Trump Republicans Look to Unseat GOP Incumbents Who Supported Impeachment

In the upcoming 2022 midterm elections, pro-Trump Republicans are seeking to unseat GOP incumbents who supported the impeachment of former President Donald Trump. Among the challengers are Chris Mathys and Jonah Schulz, who were inspired to run by their incumbents' votes to impeach or convict Trump.

Mathys, who is challenging Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI), said, "I was appalled by Fred Upton's vote to impeach President Trump. It was a betrayal of the values that our party stands for." Schulz, who is running against Rep. John Katko (R-NY), echoed similar sentiments, stating, "I believe that President Trump was unfairly targeted by the Democrats, and I was disappointed that John Katko didn't stand up for him."

Eleven out of the 17 Republicans who supported Trump's second impeachment face reelection in 2022. Forty Republicans have filed to challenge the 10 pro-impeachment GOP incumbents with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Trump has been selective with his endorsements, which could significantly impact the primary races.

Taylor Budowich, senior adviser to Max Miller, who is challenging Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH), said, "President Trump's endorsement is a game-changer in these primaries. He has a proven track record of supporting candidates who share his America First agenda." Trump has also endorsed Kelly Tshibaka, who is running against Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), promising to campaign against Murkowski.

Catalina Lauf, who is challenging Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), criticized his impeachment vote, saying, "Adam Kinzinger put his own political interests ahead of the will of his constituents. He's out of touch with the people of Illinois." Tim Murtaugh, senior adviser to Kelly Tshibaka's campaign, added, "Lisa Murkowski has a long history of betraying Alaska's conservative values. We're confident that Kelly Tshibaka will be the next senator from Alaska."

Incumbents rarely lose primaries, but Trump seeks to disrupt this norm, especially against those who defied him. South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice faces the most primary challengers, with 11 opponents. Trump's endorsement could be crucial in these races, and his supporters are eager to see him campaign against the incumbents who crossed him.

The primary races will be a test of Trump's influence within the Republican Party and could have significant implications for the party's future. The outcome of these races will likely determine whether Trump's America First agenda continues to shape the party's platform or if a more traditional conservative approach will prevail.
