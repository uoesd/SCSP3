Deadly Kabul Airport Blasts Kill Dozens, Injure Hundreds

DW – 08 – 2023 – Kabul, Afghanistan – Twin blasts at Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport have left dozens of Afghan civilians and at least 13 US soldiers dead, with many more injured. The attack, which occurred on Thursday, has been claimed by the Islamic State (ISIS) and has sparked widespread condemnation from leaders around the world.

According to General Kenneth McKenzie, Commander of US Central Command, 13 US service members were killed and 15 injured in the blasts. Speaking at a press conference, McKenzie confirmed that the explosions occurred outside the airport's Abbey Gate and the nearby Baron Hotel.

President Joe Biden has committed to continuing evacuations and vowed revenge against ISIS. "We will not be deterred by these heinous attacks," Biden said in a statement. "We will continue to evacuate those who are seeking safety, and we will not let the terrorists win."

Intelligence warnings had indicated a terror threat from the Islamic State, and the US military had been on high alert in the days leading up to the attack. However, the sheer scale of the blasts caught many off guard.

Ali Latifi, a journalist based in Kabul, described the scene as "chaotic and devastating." "There were bodies everywhere, and the wounded were screaming for help," he said. "It was a horrific sight."

Abdul Matin Amiri, a resident of Kabul, was near the airport when the blasts occurred. "I heard a loud explosion, and then another one," he said. "I saw people running and screaming, and there was smoke everywhere. It was terrifying."

The Taliban has condemned the attack, citing the presence of foreign forces as a cause for such incidents. "We condemn the bombing of the airport, which resulted in the loss of many innocent lives," said Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid. "The occupation of our country by foreign forces is the root cause of such attacks."

Emergency NGO, an Italian aid organization, reported that 60 injured individuals had arrived at their Kabul Surgical Center, with six dead on arrival. "The situation is critical, and we need all the help we can get," said Emergency's director, Rossella Miccio.

Leaders from around the world have condemned the attack and expressed their condolences. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the blasts "a horrific act of terrorism," while UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson described them as "a cowardly attack on innocent civilians." French President Emmanuel Macron also condemned the attack, saying that "France stands with the people of Afghanistan in this difficult moment."

German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer announced that all German troops had left Afghanistan, following the completion of their evacuation mission. "We have fulfilled our mission, and now it's time for us to leave," Kramp-Karrenbauer said.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for an emergency Security Council meeting in response to the attack. "The international community must come together to condemn this heinous act and work towards a peaceful resolution in Afghanistan," Guterres said.

The attack comes as the US and its allies continue to evacuate personnel and civilians from Afghanistan, following the Taliban's takeover of the country. The blasts have raised concerns about the safety of those remaining in the country, and the potential for further violence in the coming days.

As the situation in Kabul continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the attack on the city's airport has left a devastating impact on the people of Afghanistan, and the world at large.
