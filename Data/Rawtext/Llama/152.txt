Colin Powell, Former Secretary of State and Military Leader, Dies at 84

Washington – Colin Luther Powell, the former Secretary of State and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, passed away on October 18, 2022, due to complications from COVID-19, amid a battle with multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that affects the immune system. He was 84.

President Joe Biden ordered flags to be flown at half-staff until October 22 in remembrance of Powell, praising his "dignity and patriotism." In a statement, Biden highlighted Powell's remarkable career, which spanned four presidencies and included serving as National Security Advisor and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Born on April 5, 1937, in Harlem, New York, Powell was the first African American to serve as Secretary of State, a position he held under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2005. During his tenure, he led the State Department through the 9/11 attacks and supported the invasion of Iraq, a decision he later called a "blot" on his record.

Powell's legacy, however, extends beyond his service to Republican administrations. He endorsed Democrats in later years, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden. His support for Obama in 2008 was particularly significant, as he challenged conspiracy theories about Obama's faith during the election.

Former President George W. Bush praised Powell as a "great public servant" and expressed his condolences to Powell's family. In a statement, Bush highlighted Powell's commitment to justice and freedom, saying, "He was a great leader, a great soldier, and a great statesman."

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin paid tribute to Powell's legacy and leadership. Blinken praised Powell's "unwavering commitment to the values that define our nation," while Austin lauded his "exceptional leadership and dedication to public service."

International condolences poured in, with François Delattre, Secretary General of the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs, praising Powell's status as a respected military leader and statesman. Delattre said, "He was a true friend of France and a champion of the transatlantic alliance."

Powell's military career spanned 35 years, including service in Vietnam, where he was decorated for bravery. He rose to the rank of four-star general and served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1989 to 1993.

In a statement, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served alongside Powell in the Bush administration, praised his "unwavering commitment to our nation's security and his unshakeable belief in the importance of diplomacy."

Despite his many accomplishments, Powell's legacy is not without controversy. His 2003 speech to the United Nations, in which he presented evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, has been widely criticized as a mistake. Powell himself called it a "blot" on his record.

However, Powell's commitment to public service and his dedication to his country are undeniable. As President Biden said, "He was a patriot of unmatched honor and dignity."

In a statement, Powell's family expressed their gratitude for the outpouring of support and praised his "lifelong devotion to the nation." They added, "We have lost a remarkable man, a loving husband, father, and grandfather, and a great American."

Colin Powell's legacy will be remembered for generations to come, a testament to his unwavering commitment to justice, freedom, and the values that define the United States.
