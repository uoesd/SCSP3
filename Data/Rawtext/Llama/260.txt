Biden Administration Announces Major COVID-19 Vaccination Policies to Protect Workers and Strengthen the Economy

Washington, D.C. - Today, the Biden Administration announced two major policies aimed at increasing COVID-19 vaccination rates and protecting workers across the country. The policies, which cover over 100 million workers in the United States, are designed to prevent hospitalizations, save lives, and strengthen the economy.

Under the first policy, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will require employers with 100 or more employees to ensure that their workers are fully vaccinated or undergo weekly testing, and provide paid time for vaccination. Additionally, unvaccinated workers will be required to wear masks in the workplace. This policy will go into effect on January 4, 2022, and will cover over 80 million workers.

The second policy, announced by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), will require health care workers at Medicare and Medicaid participating facilities to be fully vaccinated. This policy will also go into effect on January 4, 2022, and will cover over 20 million health care workers.

The Biden Administration's vaccination policies have already shown significant results, with over 70% of adult Americans now fully vaccinated, up from less than one percent when President Biden took office. Vaccination mandates have also increased vaccination rates by over 20 percentage points in participating organizations. Economists unanimously agree that vaccination requirements will lead to a faster and stronger economic recovery.

To ensure that the policies are effective and consistent across the country, they will preempt any inconsistent state or local laws that limit employers' authority to require vaccinations, masks, or testing.

In summary, the Biden Administration's vaccination policies are a crucial step towards protecting workers, preventing hospitalizations, saving lives, and strengthening the economy. With over 100 million workers covered, these policies will help to ensure a safer and healthier workforce, and a brighter future for all Americans.
