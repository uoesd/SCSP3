Fact Check: Biden's Inauguration Ceremony and the Pandemic-Era Reality

The inauguration of President Joe Biden on January 20, 2023, was a historic moment, but it was also a moment marked by limitations and challenges imposed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent security threats. In this article, we will examine the facts surrounding the inauguration ceremony and address some of the misinformation that has been circulating.

First, it's important to note that the inauguration ceremony faced significant limitations due to the pandemic. Crowd sizes were limited, and attendees were required to wear masks and maintain social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This was not a decision taken lightly, but rather a necessary measure to ensure the safety of all those involved.

Second, former President Donald Trump did not attend the inauguration, marking a notable absence. This was not unexpected, given the tensions between the two leaders and the fact that Trump had previously questioned the legitimacy of Biden's election victory.

Third, Washington D.C. experienced heightened security following a pro-Trump riot earlier in the month. The January 6th riot, which saw Trump supporters storm the U.S. Capitol building, raised concerns about the safety of the inauguration and led to increased security measures being put in place.

Fourth, misinformation surrounding the 2020 election and Inauguration Day has been prevalent. One such example is the claim that flags were added to the National Mall to make the inauguration look less empty. However, this claim was rated as missing context by fact-checkers, as the flags were actually part of a public art exhibition representing Americans unable to attend due to COVID-19.

Fifth, Biden's inauguration maintained strict coronavirus precautions, continuing practices from his presidential campaign. This included limiting crowd sizes, enforcing mask-wearing, and ensuring social distancing measures were in place.

Sixth, the absence of large crowds marks a significant change from traditional inauguration ceremonies. The pandemic has forced a reevaluation of how we gather and celebrate, and the inauguration was no exception.

Seventh, while the pandemic has undoubtedly had a significant impact on the inauguration, it's important to note that the event was still a momentous occasion for many Americans. Despite the limitations, the ceremony was watched by millions around the world, and Biden's speech was widely praised for its message of unity and hope.

Eighth, the claim that flags were used to fill space was rated as missing context due to the pandemic and security measures. It's important to consider the context in which claims are made and to fact-check information before sharing it.

Ninth, it's worth noting that the pandemic has affected many aspects of life, including politics and government. The inauguration was just one example of how the pandemic has forced us to adapt and find new ways of doing things.
