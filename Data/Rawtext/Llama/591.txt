Kamala Harris Makes History as First Woman, Black, and Asian American Vice President

In a momentous occasion, Kamala Harris was sworn in as the Vice President of the United States, shattering several glass ceilings and making history in multiple ways. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first woman of color on the Supreme Court, administered the oath to Harris, who became the first woman, first Black person, and first Asian American to hold the office.

Harris used two Bibles for the swearing-in ceremony, one belonging to family friend Regina Shelton and the other once owned by the late Justice Thurgood Marshall. This moment was particularly significant for Harris, who reflected on her mother and the people counting on their leadership. Harris often cites her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, in her speeches, emphasizing the importance of paving the way for others.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar highlighted the significance of Harris's role for children worldwide, showing them that "anything and everything is possible." The vice presidential oath, shared with that taken by members of Congress, focuses on defending the Constitution and faithfully discharging the duties of the office.

Harris's role as vice president breaks significant gender and racial barriers in U.S. politics. She is also the first graduate of a historically Black college and the first member of a Black sorority to become vice president.

Justice Sotomayor, who administered the oath, said, "I am proud to administer the oath of office to my colleague and friend, Vice President Kamala Harris. Her historic swearing-in is a testament to the progress we have made towards a more inclusive and equitable society."

Sen. Klobuchar praised Harris's achievement, saying, "Vice President Harris's swearing-in is a momentous occasion for our country. She is a trailblazer and a role model for young people everywhere, showing them that with hard work and determination, they can achieve anything they set their minds to."

The ceremony employed Bibles with personal and historical significance, highlighting both personal journeys and broader social progress. Harris's use of two Bibles symbolized the intersection of her personal story and the larger narrative of American history.

In her remarks, Harris acknowledged the weight of the moment and the responsibility that comes with the office. She said, "I am humbled and honored to serve as Vice President of the United States. I am committed to working tirelessly to ensure that our country lives up to its founding ideals of justice, equality, and opportunity for all."

The swearing-in ceremony was attended by dignitaries and officials from across the country, including President Joe Biden, who praised Harris's qualifications and dedication to public service.

In conclusion, Kamala Harris's swearing-in as Vice President of the United States marks a significant milestone in American history, breaking down barriers and paving the way for future generations of leaders. Her commitment to justice, equality, and opportunity for all is an inspiration to us all.
