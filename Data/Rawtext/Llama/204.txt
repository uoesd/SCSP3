JBS USA Pays $11 Million in Bitcoin to Ransomware Attackers Amidst US Meat Production Disruption

In a shocking turn of events, JBS USA, one of the largest meat producers in the world, has confirmed that it paid an $11 million ransom in Bitcoin to cybercriminals following a ransomware attack that temporarily shut down its processing plants, impacting US meat production.

According to Andre Nogueira, CEO of JBS USA, the payment was made to avoid further disruption to the company's operations. "We took this step to prevent any further disruption to our operations and to protect our customers, employees, and partners," Nogueira said in a statement.

The ransomware attack, which targeted JBS's servers in the US and Australia, is believed to have been carried out by a criminal group based in Russia. The attack highlights the vulnerability of the US's critical infrastructure to cyber threats.

Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that the White House is engaging with the Russian government regarding the attack. "We are working closely with our international partners, including the Russian government, to address this issue and ensure that those responsible are held accountable," Jean-Pierre said.

Press Secretary Jen Psaki also emphasized the seriousness of the incident, stating that the FBI is investigating the attack and that President Biden is expected to discuss concerns over cyberattacks with Russian President Putin. "The President has been briefed on the situation, and we are taking it very seriously. The FBI is investigating, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely," Psaki said.

The attack on JBS follows a similar incident that targeted the Colonial Pipeline, which supplies fuel to the East Coast. That attack, also believed to have been carried out by a Russian-based criminal group, resulted in the pipeline's operators shutting down operations for several days.

While the attack on JBS had a significant impact on the company's operations, the company has assured customers and employees that no data was compromised. "We can confirm that no company, customer, or employee data was reportedly compromised in the attack," a JBS spokesperson said.

The incident highlights the growing threat of ransomware attacks, which have become increasingly common in recent years. It also underscores the need for companies and organizations to invest in robust cybersecurity measures to protect against these types of attacks.

In response to the attack, JBS has implemented additional security measures to prevent future incidents. "We take the security and privacy of our systems and data very seriously, and we are working to implement additional measures to prevent future incidents," Nogueira said.

The attack on JBS has raised concerns about the vulnerability of the US food supply chain to cyber threats. It has also highlighted the need for greater international cooperation to address the growing threat of cyberattacks.

In conclusion, the ransomware attack on JBS USA serves as a stark reminder of the importance of cybersecurity and the need for companies and organizations to invest in robust measures to protect against these types of attacks. It also underscores the need for greater international cooperation to address the growing threat of cyberattacks and ensure that those responsible are held accountable.
