Threat to Kill Democrats During Inauguration Leads to Arrest of Chicago Man

A Chicago man has been arrested for threatening to kill Democrats during President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, the latest in a series of disturbing threats and violent incidents that have raised concerns about the safety of public servants and the nation's capital.

Louis Capriotti, 45, of Chicago Heights, was taken into custody on Wednesday after allegedly leaving a voicemail threatening to kill Democrats during the inauguration, which is set to take place on January 20. The threat was made in a voicemail to a U.S. House member from New Jersey on December 29, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago.

Capriotti has a history of leaving disturbing messages for members of Congress, according to the complaint. In one voicemail, he allegedly said, "I'm gonna kill every Democrat in the world." He also made references to the storming of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters on January 6, which resulted in five deaths, and expressed support for the attack, the complaint states.

Capriotti faces a charge of transmitting a threat in interstate commerce, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison if convicted. U.S. Attorney John R. Lausch Jr. emphasized the seriousness of threats against public servants, saying, "Threatening to harm or kill elected officials is not only illegal, but it undermines the very fabric of our democracy."

The arrest comes as concerns about potential violence leading up to and during the inauguration continue to grow. President Trump has approved an emergency declaration to boost security in Washington D.C., and an FBI memo has warned of armed protests expected at all 50 state capitols and D.C. around the inauguration.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago said, "We take any threat against public servants very seriously, and we will do everything in our power to ensure the safety and security of our elected officials and the communities they serve."

The incident highlights the increasing polarization and anger in American politics, which has led to a rise in threats and violent incidents against public servants. In recent months, several members of Congress have reported receiving threatening messages, and there have been incidents of vandalism and violence against political targets.

The arrest of Capriotti is a reminder that the consequences of such threats can be severe, and that law enforcement agencies are taking a zero-tolerance approach to any form of political violence or intimidation. As U.S. Attorney Lausch said, "We will not tolerate any form of violence or intimidation against public servants, and we will do everything in our power to protect them and ensure their safety."

In the wake of the Capitol attack and the increasing number of threats against public servants, there have been calls for greater security measures and a renewed focus on the safety of elected officials. The arrest of Capriotti is a sign that law enforcement agencies are taking these concerns seriously and are working to prevent any further incidents of violence or intimidation.

As the nation prepares for the inauguration of President-elect Biden, the arrest of Capriotti serves as a reminder that the safety and security of public servants and the nation's capital are of the utmost importance. While the right to free speech and political expression is a cornerstone of American democracy, threats of violence and intimidation have no place in our political discourse, and those who engage in such behavior will face the full force of the law.
