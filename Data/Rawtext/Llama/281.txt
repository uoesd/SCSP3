Governor Cuomo Announces COVID-19 Vaccination Mandate for Healthcare Workers in New York State

Albany, NY - Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for all healthcare workers in New York State, including staff at hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, adult care, and other congregate care settings. The mandate aims to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and the Delta variant, following scientific guidance and data.

"As the Delta variant continues to spread across the state, it's crucial that we take bold action to protect New Yorkers, particularly those who are most vulnerable to the virus," Governor Cuomo said. "Requiring healthcare workers to get vaccinated is a necessary step to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and keep our communities safe."

The New York State Department of Health will issue Section 16 Orders for the development and implementation of mandatory vaccination policies. Healthcare workers will be required to receive their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by September 27. Exceptions to the mandate will be allowed for individuals with religious or medical reasons.

Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul emphasized the importance of vaccination in protecting public health. "We have seen the devastating impact of COVID-19 on our communities, and we must do everything in our power to prevent further spread of the virus," she said. "Vaccination is a crucial tool in our fight against COVID-19, and we urge all healthcare workers to get vaccinated to protect themselves, their patients, and their communities."

Dr. Howard Zucker, New York State Health Commissioner, stressed the importance of herd immunity in preventing the spread of COVID-19. "Vaccination is not just about personal protection, it's about protecting those around us who may be more vulnerable to the virus," he said. "By requiring healthcare workers to get vaccinated, we can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect those who are most at risk."

Currently, 75% of hospital workers, 74% of adult care facility workers, and 68% of nursing home workers in New York State are vaccinated. Governor Cuomo urged private businesses to implement vaccinated-only policies and school districts to mandate vaccinations to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has authorized a third COVID-19 vaccine dose for New Yorkers with compromised immune systems. The CDC recommends an additional dose for people with severe immunocompromised conditions, including those receiving cancer treatment and organ transplants. New Yorkers should consult their healthcare provider about the appropriateness of an additional vaccine dose.

Governor Cuomo emphasized the importance of following scientific guidance and data in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. "We have always followed the science and data in our response to COVID-19, and this vaccination mandate is no exception," he said. "By requiring healthcare workers to get vaccinated, we can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and safety of all New Yorkers."

The vaccination mandate is the latest in a series of measures taken by the Cuomo administration to combat COVID-19. New York State has implemented a mask mandate, social distancing measures, and testing requirements to help stop the spread of the virus.

In conclusion, the COVID-19 vaccination mandate for healthcare workers in New York State is a crucial step in protecting public health and preventing the spread of COVID-19. By requiring healthcare workers to get vaccinated, the state can help prevent the spread of the virus and protect those who are most vulnerable to its effects.
