Lady Gaga's Unlikely Escort: Marine Capt. Evan Campbell's Inauguration Day Duty

As Lady Gaga took to the stage to perform at President Joe Biden's inauguration, she had an unlikely escort by her side - Marine Capt. Evan Campbell. The tall, dashing officer was chosen to assist the pop star due to his stature, and he kept his role a secret until the big day to avoid any potential embarrassment.

"I was selected to escort Lady Gaga because of my height," Campbell said in an interview. "I'm 6'5", and they needed someone who could handle the large dress she was wearing. I was happy to help out."

Campbell and Gaga bonded backstage before their public appearance, sharing a laugh over the possibility of tripping on the elaborate gown. "We had a good conversation," Campbell recalled. "She was a little nervous, so we talked about how we both had to be careful not to trip on the dress. It was a nice moment."

Gaga was also seen praying with Campbell backstage, seeking reassurance before her performance. "She was a little nervous, understandably so," Campbell said. "She was praying and asked me to join her. It was a moment of vulnerability, but also a moment of strength. She was seeking reassurance, but also showing her dedication to her performance."

Campbell felt a deep resonance with Gaga's dedication to her craft, aligning it with his oath as a service member. "As a Marine, I'm dedicated to serving my country," he said. "Seeing Lady Gaga's dedication to her performance and her craft was inspiring. It reminded me of why I serve - to protect and support people like her who are making a positive impact."

Gaga described performing at the inauguration as the honor of her lifetime, highlighting the symbolic importance of the event. "It was an incredible experience," she said. "I've performed at many events, but this was different. It was a moment of unity and hope, and I was honored to be a part of it."

The performance was part of the "America United"-themed inauguration ceremony, encapsulating hopes for national unity and peace. "It was a powerful message," Campbell said. "Lady Gaga's performance was a symbol of unity and hope, and it was an honor to be a part of it."

Campbell felt proud to represent the Marines, especially after receiving positive attention online. "It was amazing to see the positive reaction on social media," he said. "People were proud to see a Marine representing the Corps at such an important event. It was a moment of pride for me and my fellow Marines."

As the ceremony came to a close, Gaga thanked Campbell for his assistance, highlighting the significance of the moment. "She thanked me for my help and said it was an honor to meet me," Campbell recalled. "It was a surreal moment, but also a moment of pride. I was proud to have played a small part in such an important event."

In the end, Campbell's role as Lady Gaga's escort was more than just a duty - it was a symbol of unity and hope. "It was an honor to be a part of such an important event," he said. "Lady Gaga's performance was a reminder of the power of music and art to bring people together. It was a moment I'll never forget."
