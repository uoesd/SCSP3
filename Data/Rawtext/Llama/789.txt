Biden Unveils $1.9 Trillion Rescue Plan, Including $1,400 Direct Payments to Americans

President-elect Joe Biden has announced a comprehensive $1.9 trillion rescue plan aimed at providing much-needed relief to Americans struggling with the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan includes a significant increase in direct payments to individuals and families, with a total of $465 billion designated for this purpose.

Under the plan, Americans would receive an additional $1,400 in direct payments, on top of the $600 already distributed, bringing the total amount of cash relief to $2,000. This amount would be available to all dependents, including college students and disabled adults, expanding eligibility beyond those under 17.

Income eligibility for the new $1,400 payment would likely follow the same criteria as the current $600 stimulus payments. Individuals with an adjusted gross income (AGI) over $75,000 and married couples with an AGI over $150,000 would see a gradual reduction in payments, adjusted based on the number of dependents.

According to President-elect Biden, "We need to act now to get this virus under control, to protect our communities, and to support our families. This rescue plan will provide immediate relief to those who need it most."

Eligibility for the payment would be determined based on the most recent tax return and adjusted gross income. The IRS used 2019 tax returns to determine eligibility for the second round of checks.

The plan is expected to have a significant impact on America's poorest families, with the lowest 20% of households experiencing a 29% income increase with the $2,000 checks. This is a substantial increase compared to the current $600 payment, which raises income for the same group by 8%, and the $1,200 CARES Act payments, which increased it by 11%.

President-elect Biden emphasized the importance of providing relief to those who need it most, stating, "We're going to make sure that the people who are struggling the most get the help they need."

The rescue plan also includes funding for COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and vaccine distribution, as well as support for small businesses and communities hardest hit by the pandemic.

In conclusion, President-elect Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue plan represents a significant step towards providing much-needed relief to Americans struggling with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With its focus on direct payments to individuals and families, the plan aims to support those who need it most and help stimulate economic growth.
