Raskin Renews Calls for Trump's Removal, Citing Personal Tragedy and Capitol Riot

In the wake of the Capitol riot and the death of his son, Representative Jamie Raskin is doubling down on his efforts to remove Donald Trump from office. The Maryland Democrat, who was named the House's lead manager for Trump's impeachment trial, believes that the President poses a clear and present danger to the country and that immediate action is necessary.

Raskin's resolve has been strengthened by the recent tragedy that befell his family. His son, Tommy, died by suicide on New Year's Eve, just days before the Capitol insurrection. Raskin, his daughter, and son-in-law were in the Capitol building when the violence erupted, and the experience has only reinforced his belief that Trump must be held accountable for his actions.

"I've buried my son, and now I'm trying to protect my country," Raskin said in an interview with ABC News. "I don't want any other family to go through what we've gone through."

Raskin is not alone in his calls for Trump's removal. Many Democrats are considering both impeachment and invoking the 25th Amendment as means to remove the President from office. Raskin supports the 25th Amendment as a potential bipartisan solution but is also pushing for impeachment, citing the urgency of the situation.

"We can't wait for the 25th Amendment process to play out," Raskin said. "We need to act now to protect the country from this dangerous and unstable President."

Raskin is critical of the Senate's failure to convict Trump during his first impeachment trial and holds the President accountable for recent acts, including the Capitol siege. He condemns Trump's role in inciting the violence and his lack of denouncement of the insurrection.

"The President's silence was deafening," Raskin said. "He had a chance to condemn the violence and tell his supporters to stand down, but he refused. That's unacceptable."

Raskin also raises concerns over Trump possibly pardoning those involved in the Capitol siege. He believes that such actions would only further embolden the President's supporters and undermine the rule of law.

"If the President pardons those who stormed the Capitol, it would be a slap in the face to the rule of law and a threat to our democracy," Raskin said.

The personal impact of the Capitol events on Raskin's family has been significant. His daughter and son-in-law were in the Capitol building when the violence erupted, and they were forced to barricade themselves in a room for several hours until the situation was brought under control.

"It was a terrifying experience for them, and it's something that they'll never forget," Raskin said. "But it's also a reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of standing up for what's right."

Raskin's determination to remove Trump from office is not just about politics; it's personal. He believes that the President's actions have caused irreparable harm to the country and that he must be held accountable.

"I've lost my son, and I don't want any other family to go through what we've gone through," Raskin said. "That's why I'm fighting so hard to remove this dangerous President from office."
