"Rust" Producers Disavow Responsibility, Cast Doubt on Financing Arrangements

The tragic accident on the set of the film "Rust" has sparked a flurry of questions about the production's financing and management. In the wake of the incident, which resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza, the film's executive producers have distanced themselves from the project.

Allen Cheney, speaking on behalf of the Rust production, emphasized that the EPs' role was limited to financing. "We were not involved in the day-to-day operations of the production," Cheney said. "Our involvement was strictly limited to providing financing for the film."

Emily Salveson, whose company Streamline Global was involved in the film's financing, echoed Cheney's statement. "We were not involved in the production process," Salveson said. "Our role was solely to provide financing for the film."

The production faced scrutiny for allegedly cutting corners and hiring non-union crew members. Bondit Media Capital, named as a co-financier, actually loaned money against distribution collateral without having an equity stake. The film was not bonded, indicating potential financial and management oversights.

District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies has not ruled out Alec Baldwin as a person of interest in the investigation. "We are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the accident, and we have not ruled out anyone as a person of interest at this time," Carmack-Altwies said.

Financial arrangements for "Rust" involved sales of North American distribution rights and foreign presales totaling $3 million. Emily Salveson and Ryan Donnell Smith have a background in financing through tax incentives and have been involved in other productions. "Rust Movie Productions LLC" ownership includes Cheney and Donnell Smith, with operational ties to Thomasville Pictures.

The accident on the "Rust" set has raised questions about the safety of film sets and the responsibility of producers and financiers. As the investigation continues, it remains to be seen how the tragedy will impact the future of the film industry.

In conclusion, the "Rust" producers' disavowal of responsibility and the unclear financing arrangements have added to the uncertainty surrounding the accident. The investigation is ongoing, and it is too early to say what consequences, if any, the tragedy will have for the film's financiers and producers.
