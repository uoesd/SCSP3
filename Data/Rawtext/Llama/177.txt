Resurrecting Wealth: How Government Policies are Preserving Inequality Beyond the Grave

In August 1868, Franz Vester patented a coffin with a bell and ladder, designed to prevent premature burial. Little did he know, his invention would serve as a metaphor for modern government policies that aim to preserve wealth beyond the grave. In the United States, there has been a significant shift in wealth redistribution, focusing on inheritance rather than income. This trend is exemplified by President Joe Biden's recent attempt to reform policies affecting inheritance, which was rejected by fellow Democrats.

The wealthiest one percent of Americans have seen their share of the nation's wealth grow from 30% in 1989 to 39% in 2016. This increase in wealth inequality can be attributed to rising income inequality beginning in the late 1970s. However, future wealth inequality may be driven more by unequal inheritance than by unequal income. As millennials and younger generations age, there is an anticipation of the largest transfer of wealth in U.S. history.

Current and future government policies may allow for the 'resurrection' of the deceased's wealth, perpetuating inequality beyond the grave. This raises concerns about the societal and economic implications of such wealth preservation and redistribution practices. The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals and families not only exacerbates economic inequality but also threatens to undermine democratic values and social cohesion.

In conclusion, the parallel between Vester's invention and modern government policies is striking. Just as Vester's coffin aimed to prevent premature burial, current policies aim to preserve wealth beyond death. However, this 'resurrection' of wealth may have unintended consequences, perpetuating inequality and threatening the very fabric of our society. It is time for policymakers to reevaluate their priorities and address the root causes of wealth inequality, ensuring a more equitable distribution of wealth for future generations.
