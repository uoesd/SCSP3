Aquila's Nest Vineyards Celebrates First Year with Halo-Wine Scavenger Hunt and More

Aquila's Nest Vineyards, a popular winery in Newtown, Connecticut, is celebrating its first year in operation with a slew of exciting events, including the upcoming 'Halo-Wine Scavenger Hunt' on October 30th. The vineyard, known for its picturesque setting and family-friendly atmosphere, is quickly becoming a go-to destination in the Greater Danbury area.

"We're thrilled to be celebrating our first year in business with such a fun and unique event," said Neviana Zhgaba, Co-founder of Aquila's Nest Vineyards. "The Halo-Wine Scavenger Hunt is just the beginning of our efforts to provide entertaining and socially distant activities for both locals and visitors."

The scavenger hunt, which requires reservations and a $3 entry fee per person, will take participants through the vineyard, where they'll follow clues and learn about the wine-making process and the history of Aquila's Nest Vineyards. Upon successful completion of the hunt, players will be rewarded with a free glass of wine, provided they are 21 or older.

"We wanted to create an event that would allow people to enjoy the outdoors, learn about wine, and have a great time, all while maintaining social distancing," Zhgaba explained. "We're confident that the Halo-Wine Scavenger Hunt will be a hit with both wine enthusiasts and those just looking for a fun afternoon out."

In addition to the scavenger hunt, Aquila's Nest Vineyards has a variety of other events planned for the coming months, including a chocolate and wine pairing, a Hallowine Sunset Art Walk, and live music performances. Food trucks will also be on site at most events, offering a range of delicious options for attendees.

"We're committed to providing a diverse range of activities that cater to all ages and interests," Zhgaba said. "We want Aquila's Nest Vineyards to be a place where people can come together, enjoy good company, and make lasting memories."
