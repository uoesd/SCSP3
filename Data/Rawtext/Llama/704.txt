Threats Against Colorado Springs Schools Deemed Uncredible, Police Emphasize School Safety

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) – Recent social media threats against Chinook Trail Middle School and Elementary School have been deemed uncredible by authorities, according to a statement released by Academy District 20. The schools, which share a campus on the northeast side of Colorado Springs, were the subject of alleged threats that were spread through social media.

"We take all threats seriously and investigate them thoroughly," said Lt. James Sokolik of the Colorado Springs Police Department. "In this case, we have identified the students involved and have found no credible threat."

Despite the lack of a credible threat, parents were allowed to keep their children home from school if they chose to do so. "We understand that the safety of our students is of the utmost importance to our parents, and we respect their decision to keep their children home if they feel it is necessary," said Allison Cortez, spokesperson for Academy District 20.

The incident comes at a time when school threats are on the rise nationwide, following recent high-profile incidents such as the Michigan high school shooting. "We are taking extra precautions to ensure the safety of our students and staff," said Tom Andrew, principal of Chinook Trail Middle School. "We are working closely with the police department to ensure that our security measures are up to date and effective."

Pat Schumaker, principal of Chinook Trail Elementary School, emphasized the importance of close coordination with law enforcement. "We are grateful for the support of the Colorado Springs Police Department and their commitment to keeping our schools safe," she said.

However, the police investigation was hindered by misinformation and rumor spreading on social media. "We urge the public to report incidents through official channels, such as Safe2Tell, rather than spreading rumors on social media," said Lt. Sokolik. "This helps us to investigate threats more efficiently and effectively."

Specific rumors that spread on social media included outdated photos misinterpreted as threats and an unfounded "hit list." "These rumors are completely unfounded and have no basis in reality," said Cortez. "We urge the public to be cautious and not to spread misinformation."

The police department is taking steps to address the issue of school threats. "We are working to educate the public on the proper ways to report incidents and the dangers of spreading misinformation on social media," said Sokolik. "We are also increasing our presence at schools and working closely with school administrators to ensure that our schools remain safe."

In conclusion, the recent social media threats against Chinook Trail Middle School and Elementary School have been deemed uncredible by authorities. Despite this, the police department and school administrators are taking extra precautions to ensure the safety of students and staff. They urge the public to report incidents through official channels and to be cautious of spreading misinformation on social media. By working together, we can keep our schools safe and secure for everyone.
