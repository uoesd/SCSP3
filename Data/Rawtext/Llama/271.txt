COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in Nursing Homes Surge as Delta Variant Spreads

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect communities worldwide, long-term care facilities have been disproportionately impacted. According to recent data, these facilities accounted for 31% of all US COVID-19 deaths as of June 30, 2021. However, post-vaccine rollout, weekly cases and deaths in these facilities dropped to an all-time low in June 2021, offering a glimmer of hope. Unfortunately, the Delta variant has brought a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes, with nearly 1,800 deaths reported in August 2021, the highest since February 2021. COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes have quadrupled between July and August 2021, and cases have grown by 440% during the same period.

The pandemic continues to disproportionately impact older adults and people with disabilities, highlighting the need for increased vigilance in protecting these vulnerable populations. In response to the surge in cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) endorsed an extra dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for residents of long-term care settings. Additionally, the Biden administration announced a staff vaccination mandate for nursing homes, emphasizing the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of the virus. As of mid-September 2021, about 84% of nursing home residents and 64% of nursing home staff have been vaccinated. While progress has been made, continued efforts are necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of those in long-term care facilities.
