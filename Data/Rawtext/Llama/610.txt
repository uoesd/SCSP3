Vice President Kamala Harris Announces Nationwide Call to Action to Improve Maternal Health

Washington, D.C. - Today, Vice President Kamala Harris announced a nationwide Call to Action to improve maternal health and reduce mortality and morbidity. The announcement comes as the Biden-Harris Administration emphasizes addressing maternal health as a key priority, highlighting the significant disparity among Black women and Native American women.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates that 720,000 more people could gain Medicaid postpartum coverage if all states extend coverage. In response, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have proposed a new "Birthing-Friendly" hospital designation and issued guidance for year-long Medicaid postpartum coverage.

The Administration marked the first-ever White House Maternal Health Day of Action and announced new commitments under the Build Back Better Act. The Build Back Better Act proposes a $3 billion investment in maternal health, including improvements in workforce diversity, data collection, social factors, substance use disorders, research, coverage, and care coordination.

States are encouraged to expand Medicaid coverage to 12 months postpartum, a significant increase from the current 60 days. A new HHS report shows the benefits of extending Medicaid postpartum coverage to a full year.

The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations, worsening over the past 20 years, particularly for Black and Native American women. Vice President Harris has historically advocated for improved maternal health through legislation like the Maternal CARE Act and the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act.

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to addressing the systemic issues that contribute to maternal mortality and morbidity. By expanding access to healthcare, improving data collection, and addressing social determinants of health, we can ensure that all mothers have the opportunity to thrive.

"Every mother deserves the chance to have a healthy pregnancy, a safe delivery, and a healthy postpartum period," said Vice President Harris. "The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to addressing the unacceptable disparities in maternal health that exist in our country. We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that all mothers have access to the care they need and deserve."
