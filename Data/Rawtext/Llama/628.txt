Biden and Harris Confirmed as President and Vice President, Despite Violent Pro-Trump Protests

In a historic and tumultuous day, Congress confirmed the election results of President-elect Joseph R. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris, despite a violent incident where a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol. The confirmation came after a tense and dramatic day, where a statement was made emphasizing that violence does not lead to victory and freedom wins, and it is still the people's house.

One senator reconsidered their intention to object the certification of electoral votes due to the events at the Capitol, stating they could not in good conscience object. The Senate rejected an objection to the electoral votes from Pennsylvania with a vote of 7 ayes to 92 nays. The House of Representatives also rejected the objection to the electoral votes of Pennsylvania.

Joseph R. Biden Jr. received 306 electoral votes while Donald J. Trump received 232 electoral votes for the presidency. Kamala D. Harris received 306 electoral votes while Michael R. Pence received 232 electoral votes for the vice presidency. A total of 538 electors were appointed, with a majority of 270 required.

The certification of the electoral votes for President and Vice President will be entered into the journals of the Senate and the House of Representatives. This marks the end of a long and contentious election process, and the beginning of a new era in American politics.

Despite the violence and chaos that erupted at the Capitol, the democratic process prevailed, and the will of the American people was upheld. The peaceful transfer of power, a hallmark of American democracy, will continue, and President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris will be sworn in on January 20th.

The events of today serve as a reminder of the strength and resilience of American democracy, and the importance of upholding the principles of freedom and democracy. The confirmation of President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris is a testament to the enduring power of the American people and their commitment to a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.
