Lady Gaga's Inauguration Look: A Fashion Statement and a Symbol of Peace

Lady Gaga, the multihyphenate star known for her bold fashion choices, has revealed that the Schiaparelli Haute Couture dress she wore at President Joe Biden's inauguration is one of her favorite outfits. The dress, which featured in a British Vogue video showcasing 20 of Gaga's most iconic looks, was not only stunning but also bulletproof, as revealed by the star herself.

Choosing Schiaparelli, an Italian designer, was a personal choice for Gaga, reflecting her Italian-American heritage. The dress was a beautiful design featuring a giant gilded brooch in the shape of a dove, symbolizing peace. Daniel Roseberry, the current creative director of Maison Schiaparelli, described the ensemble as a love letter to America, celebrating Gaga's artistry.

Gaga's fashion choices for the inauguration did not stop at the Schiaparelli dress. She also wore a white cape by Givenchy before the inauguration, which fans likened to Princess Leia. For the singing performance, Gaga's outfit included a fitted navy cashmere jacket and a voluminous washed red silk faille skirt. Her hair was styled in a braid, similar to the previous day, but accented with a red flower.

Roseberry, who is American, ties the French brand Schiaparelli back to the U.S. with his background. He expressed that the ensemble was a celebration of Gaga's artistry and a representation of the peace and unity that the inauguration symbolized. Lady Gaga's fashion choices have always been a statement, and her inauguration looks were no exception. She proved that fashion can be both a form of self-expression and a symbol of hope and unity.
