Australia Halts Evacuation Flights from Afghanistan After Suicide Bombings

CANBERRA, Aug 27 (Reuters) – Australia has suspended evacuation flights from Afghanistan following Islamic State suicide bombings that killed scores of civilians and at least 13 U.S. military personnel, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Friday.

"The government has taken the decision to pause our evacuation flights from Kabul, effective immediately," Morrison told a news conference in Canberra. "The risk to our personnel and the Australian public has become too great."

The attacks, which occurred on Thursday, targeted the Kabul airport and a nearby hotel, where many people had gathered to await evacuation flights. Morrison said that Australia's military personnel were evacuated from Kabul hours before the attacks, but the government has since shifted its focus to a post-evacuation phase, prioritizing a humanitarian program for those affected by the conflict.

Despite Australia's halt, some Western countries have accelerated their evacuations, with flights still departing from Kabul. However, Morrison warned that Australians and visa holders were unlikely to get seats on remaining flights.

"We have already evacuated 4,100 citizens and Afghans with visas in the last nine days, and we are working to determine if any citizens or residents were among the casualties of the Kabul attacks," Morrison said.

Foreign Minister Marise Payne advised Australians and visa holders to avoid the airport due to the risk of further attacks. "We urge all Australians and visa holders to exercise extreme caution and avoid the airport area until further notice," Payne said in a statement.

Morrison expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and reiterated the government's commitment to supporting those affected by the conflict. "Our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those who have been killed or injured in these barbaric attacks," he said. "We will continue to work closely with our international partners to ensure the safety and security of all those involved."

According to Morrison, the Australian government is working to determine the exact number of Australian visa holders who remain in Afghanistan. He emphasized that the government's primary concern is the safety and security of its citizens and those who have been granted visas to travel to Australia.

In the aftermath of the attacks, Morrison said that the government has been in close contact with international partners, including the United States, to coordinate efforts and ensure the safety of all personnel involved in the evacuation process.

The suspension of evacuation flights from Afghanistan marks a significant shift in Australia's response to the conflict, as the country had previously been working to evacuate its citizens and Afghans with visas as quickly as possible. However, Morrison emphasized that the government's priority remains the safety and security of its citizens and those who have been granted visas to travel to Australia.
