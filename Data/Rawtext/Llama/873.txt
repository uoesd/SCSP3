Tiger Woods Hospitalized with Severe Leg Injuries After Los Angeles Car Accident

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Golf legend Tiger Woods was hospitalized with severe leg injuries after a car accident in Los Angeles on Tuesday, with his agent saying he underwent a "long surgical procedure" on his lower right leg and ankle.

According to Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva, Woods was conscious and able to communicate after the accident, which occurred on a steep and winding road in the Palos Verdes Peninsula area. No evidence of driver impairment was found, and Woods was assessed by emergency workers at the scene.

"Tiger Woods was in a serious car accident in Los Angeles, and he has sustained severe leg injuries," Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent, said in a statement. "He has undergone a long surgical procedure on his lower right leg and ankle, and he is currently recovering at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center."

Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said that firefighters arrived at the scene to find Woods trapped inside his vehicle, which had rolled over multiple times. "We were able to extricate him, and he was transported to a local hospital for treatment," Osby said.

Sheriff's deputy Carlos Gonzales, who responded to the accident, said that the impact of the crash was significant. "The vehicle sustained major damage, and it's fortunate that Mr. Woods was able to survive such a severe accident," Gonzales said.

Anish Mahajan, Chief Medical Officer and interim CEO at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, said that Woods' injuries included open fractures to his tibia and fibula, which were stabilized with a rod, screws, and pins. "Mr. Woods is currently in good condition, and he is expected to make a full recovery," Mahajan said.

The accident's impact on Woods' career remains unclear, but the 45-year-old golfer has a history of overcoming injuries and setbacks. Woods has won 15 major championships and 82 PGA Tour events, and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time.

Sheriff Villanueva noted that the crash site is known for frequent accidents, suggesting that speed might have been a factor. "We're still investigating the cause of the accident, but it's a dangerous road, and speed could have played a role," Villanueva said.

Woods' accident has sparked an outpouring of support from the golf community and beyond. PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan released a statement expressing concern for Woods' well-being and praising his contributions to the sport. "Tiger Woods is a true champion and a transformative figure in golf, and we are deeply concerned about his health and well-being," Monahan said. "We wish him a speedy recovery and look forward to his return to the golf course."

Alex Rodriguez, the former New York Yankees star, tweeted his support for Woods, saying, "Praying for my brother @TigerWoods. Hoping for a speedy recovery and looking forward to seeing him back on the course soon."

This is not Woods' first encounter with an auto-related incident. In 2009, he was involved in a car accident outside his home in Florida, which led to allegations of infidelity and a divorce from his wife, Elin Nordegren.

Woods' accident has also renewed focus on the dangers of speeding and reckless driving. Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn called for increased safety measures on the road where Woods' accident occurred. "We need to take a closer look at this road and see what can be done to prevent accidents like this from happening in the future," Hahn said.

As Woods begins his recovery, his fans and fellow golfers are eagerly awaiting his return to the sport he has dominated for so long. Despite the uncertainty surrounding his career, one thing is clear: Tiger Woods is a fighter, and he will do everything in his power to get back on the course and continue his legacy as one of the greatest golfers of all time.
