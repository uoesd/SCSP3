Ida's Remnants Cause Devastation on East Coast, Leaving 46 Dead

NEW YORK (AP) – The remnants of Hurricane Ida brought devastation to the East Coast, leaving at least 46 people dead in its wake. The storm's aftermath was linked to climate change, with experts noting that warmer air can hold more rain, and urban settings exacerbate flooding due to extensive pavement.

In New Jersey, at least 23 people died, including 11 in flooded basement apartments. Gov. Phil Murphy described the flooding as "unprecedented" and said the state was "not prepared" for the storm's ferocity.

In New York City, 13 people died, with many recounting horrific experiences of rapidly rising floodwaters. Sophy Liu, a survivor, said she was trapped in her basement apartment for hours, surrounded by water up to her neck. "I thought I was going to die," she said.

Deborah Torres, another survivor, recounted efforts to save her neighbors and loved ones. "We were trying to get everyone out, but the water was just too high," she said.

Significant flooding and damages were reported across multiple states, including Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.

Despite warnings from the National Hurricane Center about potential flash flooding, officials in New York expressed surprise at the storm's intensity. "We did not expect this level of flooding," said Mayor Bill de Blasio.

Nearly 500 vehicles were abandoned on flooded highways in New York, and subway service was disrupted due to water entering the tunnels.

Officials, including President Joe Biden, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, and Mayor de Blasio, have responded to the crisis, with federal first responders helping in cleanup efforts.

The storm also spawned at least 10 tornadoes across the region, causing additional damage.

This disaster follows just days after Ida made landfall in Louisiana as the fifth-strongest storm ever to hit the U.S.

"We're heartbroken by the loss of life and the destruction caused by this storm," said President Biden. "We'll do everything we can to help those affected."

Gov. Hochul declared a state of emergency in New York and said the state was working to assess the damage and provide aid to those affected. "We're doing everything we can to help those in need," she said.

Mayor de Blasio urged residents to stay off the streets and avoid flooded areas. "We need to keep people safe," he said.

Chief of Department Rodney Harrison, of the New York City Fire Department, said the department had responded to hundreds of calls related to the flooding. "We're doing everything we can to help those in need," he said.

Mayor J. Christian Bollwage, of Elizabeth, New Jersey, said the flooding was the worst he had seen in his 30 years in office. "It's devastating," he said.

Greg Turner, whose mother died in the flooding, said he was heartbroken. "She was the best person I ever knew," he said.

Jeanine Zubrzycki, a resident of Mullica Hill, New Jersey, said she was grateful to have made it through the storm safely. "It was terrifying, but we're lucky to be alive," she said.

The storm's intensity and devastation have raised concerns about the impact of climate change on extreme weather events. "This is what climate change looks like," said Mayor de Blasio. "We need to take action to protect ourselves and our communities from these kinds of disasters."

As cleanup efforts continue, officials are urging residents to remain vigilant and take precautions to stay safe. "We're not out of the woods yet," said Gov. Murphy. "We need to stay focused and keep people safe."
