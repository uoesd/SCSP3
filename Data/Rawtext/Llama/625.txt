Harris to Promote 'America is Back' Message in Asia Trip

Vice President Kamala Harris is set to embark on a six-day trip to Singapore and Vietnam from August 20 to August 26, with the aim of promoting the message "America is back" and signaling the Biden-Harris Administration's interest in Asia.

According to Symone Sanders, Chief Spokesperson for the Vice President, the visit will emphasize the importance of comprehensive engagement and strategic partnerships in Asia. "The Vice President's trip will highlight the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to the region and our desire to build strong, democratic partnerships that promote stability, security, and prosperity," Sanders said.

Harris will discuss trade, security, including issues in the South China Sea, and promote economic cooperation during her meetings with government officials, leaders from the private sector, and civil society leaders. Key areas of discussion will include regional security, the Covid-19 pandemic, and climate change.

The visit marks a significant milestone as Harris will be the first vice president ever to visit Vietnam. This will be Harris's first trip to the region as vice president and her second international trip since taking office.

The trip underscores the Biden Administration's effort to counter China's growing influence through democratic partnerships in the region. President Biden has not yet traveled to the region since taking office but has hosted leaders from Japan and South Korea.

Sanders emphasized that the trip is an opportunity for the Vice President to engage with key partners in the region and demonstrate the Administration's commitment to a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region. "The Vice President's visit will send a clear message that the United States is committed to working with our allies and partners to promote stability, security, and prosperity in the region," Sanders said.

Harris's trip to Singapore and Vietnam comes at a time when tensions in the South China Sea are escalating, and the Covid-19 pandemic continues to pose significant challenges to the region. The visit is seen as a sign of the Administration's commitment to addressing these challenges and promoting a rules-based order in the region.

In Singapore, Harris will meet with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and other government officials to discuss ways to strengthen the U.S.-Singapore partnership and promote regional stability. She will also engage with business leaders and entrepreneurs to promote U.S. trade and investment in the region.

In Vietnam, Harris will meet with President Nguyen Phu Trong and other government officials to discuss ways to deepen the U.S.-Vietnam comprehensive partnership and promote economic cooperation. She will also visit a healthcare facility to highlight the U.S. government's support for Vietnam's efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.

Overall, Harris's trip to Singapore and Vietnam is seen as a significant step in promoting the Biden-Harris Administration's vision for a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region. The visit underscores the Administration's commitment to engaging with key partners in the region and promoting democratic values and principles.
