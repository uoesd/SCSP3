Kamala Harris' Approval Rating Plummets to Historic Low, Poll Shows

A new USA Today/Suffolk University poll has revealed that Vice President Kamala Harris' approval rating has dropped to a historic low of 28%, marking a significant decline in her popularity among Americans. This figure is the lowest approval rating for any modern vice president at this point in their tenure, with a majority of 51% of respondents expressing their disapproval of her job performance.

The poll also showed that President Joe Biden's approval rating has hit a new low, standing at 38%. While this is not a record low for a president at this stage in their term, it is still a concerning sign for the administration.

Harris' low approval rating is particularly noteworthy given the challenging assignments she has been tasked with, including managing the migration surge of asylum seekers at the southern border. Despite her efforts, her popularity has continued to decline, with aides reportedly concerned about her prospects in the 2024 presidential election, particularly in light of potential competition from Pete Buttigieg.

In comparison, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was previously the most unpopular US vice president with a low of 30%, is slightly less unpopular than Harris at the same point in his tenure. This highlights the extent to which Harris' approval rating is unprecedentedly low for a modern vice president.

The poll, which included a sample of 1,000 registered voters nationwide, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. Its results were published in a story by Business Insider, available exclusively to its subscribers.

The reasons behind Harris' declining popularity are complex and multifaceted. Some have criticized her handling of the border crisis, while others have expressed disappointment with her perceived lack of progressive policies. Additionally, her perceived distance from progressive stalwarts like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren may have contributed to her decline in popularity among certain segments of the Democratic base.

Despite these challenges, Harris remains a formidable figure in the Democratic Party, with a strong track record as a prosecutor and senator. Her supporters point to her tireless advocacy for criminal justice reform, immigration reform, and women's rights as evidence of her commitment to progressive values.

The implications of Harris' low approval rating are significant, particularly in the context of the 2024 presidential election. With Buttigieg and other candidates already beginning to gain momentum, Harris' struggles to connect with voters could pose a significant threat to her prospects.

Ultimately, the reasons behind Harris' declining popularity are complex and multifaceted, and it remains to be seen how she will address these challenges in the coming months. However, one thing is clear: Harris' approval rating is at a historic low, and she will need to take bold action to reverse this trend if she hopes to remain a viable candidate in the 2024 presidential race.
