FDA Expands Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Booster Eligibility to 16- and 17-Year-Olds

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today announced the expansion of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster eligibility to 16- and 17-year-olds, furthering the agency's commitment to protecting public health during the ongoing pandemic.

Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D., emphasized the continued importance of vaccinations and boosters in preventing the spread of COVID-19. "As we continue to battle the pandemic, it's crucial that we take all necessary steps to protect ourselves and our communities from the virus," Woodcock said. "Today's action demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that all individuals, including our youth, have access to the best available protection against COVID-19."

The authorization of a single booster dose for 16- and 17-year-olds at least six months after primary Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination follows the Nov. 19 authorization for booster doses for individuals 18 and older. The FDA has determined that the benefits of a booster dose outweigh the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis in the younger age group.

Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, cited waning vaccine effectiveness as the rationale for boosters. "As we've seen with other vaccines, the immune response to COVID-19 vaccines can wane over time, leaving individuals more susceptible to infection," Marks said. "By authorizing a booster dose for 16- and 17-year-olds, we're ensuring that this age group has the best chance of maintaining protection against COVID-19."

The FDA's analysis of immune response supports booster dose effectiveness in youth and adults. The agency has also assessed the benefits of a booster dose outweighing the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis in the younger age group.

Pfizer is conducting studies on myocarditis and pericarditis risks, and the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are closely monitoring safety. The FDA did not convene the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee for the decision, as the agency has previously established a thorough review process for COVID-19 vaccines.

Only the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and Comirnaty are authorized for the 16- and 17-year-old age group. The FDA urges individuals to consult their healthcare provider regarding booster dose eligibility and administration.

In conclusion, the FDA's expansion of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster eligibility to 16- and 17-year-olds demonstrates the agency's unwavering commitment to protecting public health during the pandemic. By ensuring that all individuals have access to the best available protection against COVID-19, we can work towards a safer, healthier future for all.
