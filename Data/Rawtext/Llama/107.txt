Cuomo Brothers' Interviews on CNN Now Seen Unfavorably Amid Nursing Home Deaths Scandal

NEW YORK (AP) – The interviews between CNN's Chris Cuomo and his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, which were previously seen as lighthearted and entertaining, are now being criticized in the wake of the COVID-19 nursing home deaths scandal.

CNN has banned Chris Cuomo from interviewing or covering stories about his brother, a policy that was temporarily lifted in 2020. However, the network has continued to cover the nursing home death scandal on programs other than Chris Cuomo's, with anchors openly inviting the governor to respond.

"The optics of Chris Cuomo interviewing his brother were always questionable, but they're even more problematic now given the nursing home scandal," said Roy Gutterman, a media law professor at Syracuse University. "It creates a conflict of interest, and it's unlikely that Chris Cuomo would ask his brother tough questions."

The Cuomo brothers' interviews last spring were characterized by their banter, with Chris Cuomo even joking about his brother's habit of kissing him on the cheek. However, the interviews are now being criticized as inappropriate, given the seriousness of the nursing home deaths scandal.

The Cuomo administration has been accused of undercounting COVID-19 deaths of nursing home residents to avoid blame for their policies. New York's attorney general reported the administration's undercounting of deaths, and Gov. Cuomo has blamed nursing home staff for the virus spread. An aide to the governor even admitted that they withheld the true nursing home death toll out of fear it would be used against them by Trump's Justice Department.

Despite the scandal, Chris Cuomo has defended his interviews with his brother, calling them significant and entertaining. However, he has followed CNN's policy and not covered related scandals.

Jake Tapper, another CNN anchor, has been critical of Gov. Cuomo's handling of the nursing home deaths, calling it a bad decision that may have cost lives. Tapper has also accused the Cuomo administration of hiding data.

The nursing home deaths scandal has put a spotlight on the Cuomo brothers' interviews, raising questions about the appropriateness of a news anchor interviewing a family member who is a public official.

"The Cuomo brothers' interviews were always a bit uncomfortable, but they're even more problematic now given the seriousness of the nursing home deaths scandal," said Gutterman. "It's important for journalists to maintain their independence and avoid conflicts of interest, especially when it comes to covering public officials."

In the wake of the scandal, CNN has reiterated its policy of not allowing Chris Cuomo to interview or cover stories about his brother. The network has also emphasized its commitment to covering the nursing home deaths scandal and holding those in power accountable.

The controversy surrounding the Cuomo brothers' interviews highlights the challenges of journalism in the age of social media, where conflicts of interest and perceived biases can quickly become magnified. It also underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in journalism, particularly when it comes to covering public officials and their families.
