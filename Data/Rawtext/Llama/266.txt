President Biden's Address on the Fight Against COVID-19: A Call to Action for Vaccination and Boosters

My fellow Americans,

I stand before you today to provide an update on our nation's efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. As we approach the holiday season, I want to acknowledge the fatigue and frustration that many of you are feeling. It's been a long and difficult journey, but I want to assure you that we are making progress.

First and foremost, let's talk about the importance of vaccination and boosters. We have seen time and time again that vaccinated individuals are significantly less likely to contract COVID-19, and if they do, they are likely to experience mild symptoms. This is especially important during the holiday season, when we are more likely to gather with family and friends.

I understand that some of you may be hesitant to get vaccinated, but I urge you to reconsider. Vaccination is not only a personal choice, but it's also a patriotic duty. By getting vaccinated, you are not only protecting yourself, but you are also protecting those around you who may be more vulnerable to the virus.

Since July, we have seen a significant increase in the number of vaccinated Americans. This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our healthcare workers, scientists, and public health officials. But there is still more work to be done. I urge all eligible Americans to get vaccinated and boosted as soon as possible.

I want to assure you that we are doing everything in our power to make vaccination and boosters accessible to all. We have added 10,000 new vaccination sites, and FEMA is supporting vaccination efforts across the country. This is not a return to March 2020. We are better prepared now, with over 200 million fully vaccinated Americans, a surplus of medical supplies, and a much better understanding of the virus.

I also want to emphasize the importance of indoor mask-wearing in public settings. This provides an extra layer of protection, especially for those who are not yet vaccinated. I know it can be inconvenient, but it's a small sacrifice to make for the safety of ourselves and those around us.

To those who are fully vaccinated, I want to assure you that you can safely celebrate the holidays with your loved ones. Enjoy your time together, but remember to take precautions to protect yourselves and others.

In conclusion, my fellow Americans, I want to thank you for your resilience and determination. We have come a long way in our fight against COVID-19, but we still have work to do. Let's continue to work together to protect ourselves, our communities, and our country.

Thank you, and may God bless America.
