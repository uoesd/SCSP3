Swalwell Sues Trump, Allies Over Capitol Riot, Citing Civil Rights Violations

WASHINGTON (AP) – Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., has filed a lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani, and Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., alleging that they conspired to violate his civil rights and inflict emotional distress during the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges that the defendants made baseless claims of election fraud and incited violence that led to the storming of the Capitol, resulting in the deaths of five people, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer.

"The defendants, in their pursuit of power and self-interest, have ignited a fire of hatred and violence that has consumed our country," the lawsuit states. "Their actions have caused irreparable harm to our democracy and have left a stain on our nation's history."

Swalwell, who was trapped in the House chamber during the attack, recounts in the lawsuit how he feared for his life as rioters stormed the building, shouting death threats and wielding weapons. He seeks unspecified damages and wants the defendants to notify him of any large rallies they plan to hold in Washington in advance.

Trump's spokesman, Jason Miller, dismissed the lawsuit as meritless, saying, "This is just another witch hunt by a desperate politician trying to make a name for himself."

Brooks, who spoke at the rally that preceded the riot, called the lawsuit "frivolous" and said, "It's just a publicity stunt by a politician who's trying to get his name in the news."

The lawsuit cites Trump's own words to accuse him of inciting the riot, similar to arguments made during his impeachment trial. It also uses a federal civil rights law to counter officials' intimidation, similar to a lawsuit filed by Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who is also suing Trump and his allies over the riot.

Swalwell's lawsuit details how Trump and his allies spread false election fraud claims before and after the 2020 election, creating a climate of fear and mistrust that culminated in the violence at the Capitol.

"The defendants' actions were not only unlawful, but they also undermined the very foundations of our democracy," the lawsuit states. "They have caused irreparable harm to our country and have left a stain on our nation's history."

The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal challenges facing Trump and his allies over their roles in the insurrection. In addition to Thompson's lawsuit, several other lawmakers and police officers have filed lawsuits against Trump and his supporters, alleging that they incited violence and violated their civil rights.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has characterized the lawsuits as politically motivated. His supporters have also defended his actions, saying that he was simply exercising his right to free speech.

But Swalwell and other critics argue that Trump's actions went beyond the bounds of free speech, and that he has a responsibility to protect the safety and well-being of the American people.

"The defendants' actions were not only unlawful, but they also undermined the very foundations of our democracy," Swalwell said in a statement. "They have caused irreparable harm to our country and have left a stain on our nation's history."
