Disabled Californians Left Behind by Golden State Stimulus

As the pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the economy, California has implemented the Golden State Stimulus to provide financial relief to its residents. However, some disabled Californians, particularly those on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), are feeling neglected by the state's stimulus package.

Janet Clendenin, an SSDI recipient, expressed her frustration over being ineligible for the $600 Golden State Stimulus payments. "I was excited to hear about the stimulus, but then I found out I wasn't eligible because I didn't work in 2020," Clendenin said. "It's frustrating because I'm living in poverty and could really use that money to pay my bills."

Clendenin is not alone in her frustration. According to Disability Rights California, approximately 1.2 million Californians on SSDI were skipped by the stimulus payments. The eligibility criteria for the Golden State Stimulus mainly targeted those with work income in 2020 or who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI).

Andrew Imparato, Executive Director of Disability Rights California, criticized the state for not adequately supporting its disabled residents during the pandemic. "The Golden State Stimulus was meant to provide relief to those who are struggling financially, but it ignores a significant portion of our community who are living in poverty," Imparato said. "It's unacceptable that the state is not doing more to support disabled Californians."

H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for the Department of Finance, cited logistical challenges in including SSDI recipients due to lack of access to federal records. "We understand the concerns of SSDI recipients, but including them in the stimulus payments would require significant changes to our tax system," Palmer said. "We are exploring options for future stimulus payments, but it's a complex issue."

Despite the exclusion, SSDI recipients often face significant financial hardships. Many live in poverty and deal with additional medical expenses, making it difficult to make ends meet. Charis Hill, a disabled activist, managed to qualify for the stimulus by filing taxes for freelance work, highlighting the unfairness faced by many on SSDI.

"It's ridiculous that I had to jump through hoops to qualify for the stimulus when I'm already struggling to make ends meet," Hill said. "The state needs to do more to support disabled residents, especially during the pandemic."

Gov. Newsom initially announced the Golden State Stimulus in January, with several changes and expansions occurring over the following months. However, the exclusion of SSDI recipients has been a constant source of criticism.

Sydney Chandler, a caretaker for her cousin with severe disabilities, expressed anger over the exclusion of SSDI recipients. "As a caretaker, I see firsthand the financial burdens that come with caring for a loved one with disabilities," Chandler said. "The state needs to recognize the value of caretakers and provide support to those who need it most."

There is some legislative effort to include SSDI recipients in future stimulus payments, as negotiations continue over the state budget. Disability advocates are pushing for changes to the eligibility criteria to ensure that all disabled Californians receive the support they need.

In conclusion, the Golden State Stimulus has provided much-needed relief to many Californians, but it has also highlighted the struggles faced by disabled residents. As the pandemic continues, it is crucial that the state addresses the financial hardships faced by SSDI recipients and provides them with the support they deserve.
