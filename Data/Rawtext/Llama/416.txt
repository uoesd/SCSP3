Derek Chauvin Hires New Attorney to Appeal Murder Conviction in George Floyd's Death

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murder in the death of George Floyd, has hired a new attorney to represent him in his appeal. William Mohrman, a lawyer with a history of taking on controversial cases, filed a document with the court indicating his representation of Chauvin.

Chauvin was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in June and sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison. He is seeking to appeal his conviction on 14 grounds, including claims of an unfair trial location and the lack of jury sequestration.

Mohrman's firm, Mohrman, Kaardal & Erickson, has been involved in several high-profile cases, including an attempt to vacate the 2020 presidential election results and a lawsuit against COVID-19 vaccine mandates for Minnesota health care workers. A federal judge recently denied a temporary restraining order related to the vaccine mandate lawsuit.

Chauvin's request for a public defender to represent him on appeal was denied due to an assessment of his assets. Originally, his legal representation was funded by the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association's legal defense fund.

In addition to his state conviction, Chauvin faces federal charges for violating George Floyd's civil rights. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges.

Mohrman's representation of Chauvin is the latest development in a case that has captured national attention and sparked widespread protests against police brutality and systemic racism. The death of George Floyd, who was killed when Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes, has become a symbol of the need for police reform and accountability.

The appeal process is expected to be lengthy and complex, with both sides presenting their arguments and evidence to the court. The outcome could have significant implications for Chauvin's future, as well as for the broader community seeking justice and accountability in the wake of George Floyd's death.
