Harris to Lead National Space Council, Focusing on STEM Education and Cybersecurity

CNN – Washington D.C. – Vice President Kamala Harris is set to chair the National Space Council, continuing the council's operation under the Biden administration. Harris announced her new role in a tweet, expressing her honor in leading the council and emphasizing America's achievements in space.

According to a senior administration official, Harris aims to focus the council's efforts on several key areas, including STEM education, cybersecurity, commercial space activity, diversity, and peaceful space norms. The official also highlighted Harris' approach to focusing on work rather than big displays, differing from the tenure of previous council chair, Vice President Mike Pence.

The National Space Council was previously led by Pence during the Trump administration, which had revived the council in 2017. The council's operation will continue under the executive order from 2017, with an ongoing review for potential changes. The council assists the President in forming national space policies and strategies, balancing civil, commercial, and national security space activities.

Harris' duties as chair of the National Space Council will include swearing in the newly confirmed NASA administrator Bill Nelson. There is no set date for the council's first meeting under Harris, but she will begin her duties soon.

In addition to her role as chair of the National Space Council, Harris has other significant responsibilities, including diplomatic efforts in the Northern Triangle and expanding broadband access.

The Biden administration has emphasized the importance of space exploration and development, with President Biden stating that he wants to "unleash the full potential" of America's space program. Harris' leadership of the National Space Council is seen as a key part of this effort, as the council plays a critical role in shaping the nation's space policies and strategies.

Overall, Harris' appointment as chair of the National Space Council highlights the Biden administration's commitment to space exploration and development, as well as its focus on STEM education, cybersecurity, and diversity. With Harris at the helm, the council is poised to play a significant role in shaping the nation's space policies and strategies for years to come.
