Biden's Inauguration: Separating Fact from Fiction

Joe Biden's inauguration as the 46th President of the United States was a historic event that was witnessed by millions of people around the world. However, in the age of social media, misinformation and conspiracy theories have a tendency to spread quickly. In this article, we will fact-check some of the claims and theories surrounding Biden's inauguration and presidency.

Witnesses and Live Coverage:

One of the most widely spread conspiracy theories surrounding Biden's inauguration is that it was fake or staged. However, this claim is easily debunked by the numerous people who witnessed the event in person, including dignitaries, politicians, and members of the public. The inauguration was also broadcast live by several major news outlets, including ABC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, NBC, and PBS.

Lack of Disruptive Events:

Another theory suggests that Biden's inauguration was staged due to a lack of disruptive events, such as protests or security breaches. However, this theory ignores the fact that the inauguration was held during a pandemic, which made it necessary to limit the number of attendees and implement strict security measures. Additionally, the absence of disruptive events is not unusual for a presidential inauguration, as security measures are typically put in place to prevent such incidents.

Social Media Flags:

Social media platforms, such as Facebook, have flagged posts spreading false information about Biden's inauguration. Facebook's efforts to combat false news include flagging posts that have been deemed false by fact-checking organizations, such as PolitiFact.

White House YouTube Channel:

Despite having more dislikes than likes, the White House's official inauguration video remains available on its YouTube channel. This contradicts claims that the video was removed or censored.

Executive Orders:

Claims that Biden's executive orders are not available online are false. All of Biden's executive orders have been published on the Office of the Federal Register website, which is the official repository for federal regulations and executive orders.

Granddaughters' Whereabouts:

A conspiracy theory surrounding Biden's granddaughters claims that they disappeared and reappeared during inauguration coverage. However, this theory is easily debunked by the fact that the granddaughters were present throughout the event, due to different camera angles.

Private Plane:

Biden broke with tradition by taking a private plane to Washington D.C. for his inauguration, due to security concerns. This contradicts claims that he did not actually arrive in Washington D.C.

Oval Office Appearances:

Allegations that Biden's Oval Office appearances were on a movie set are debunked by the fact that he has been seen multiple times in the White House. Additionally, photos and videos of Biden in the Oval Office have been released by the White House and various news outlets.

Illegitimate Presidency:

The conspiracy theory claiming that Biden's presidency is illegitimate is rated 'Pants on Fire!' by PolitiFact, indicating that it is completely false. Biden won the 2020 presidential election fair and square, and his presidency is recognized by the U.S. government and the international community.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, there is no evidence to support the conspiracy theories surrounding Joe Biden's inauguration and presidency. The claims that his inauguration was fake, that he is not the real president, and that his executive orders are not available online are all false. It is important to fact-check information before sharing it on social media to avoid spreading misinformation.
