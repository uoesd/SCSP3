Stimulus Payment Rumors: Separating Fact from Fiction

A social media claim circulating this week has caught our attention, and we're here to set the record straight. The claim suggests that a fourth stimulus payment of $2,000 per person is on its way, with some sources stating that it will be distributed by Memorial Day weekend. However, we've fact-checked this claim, and it's simply not true.

First and foremost, it's important to note that Congress has not approved a fourth round of direct stimulus payments as part of COVID-19 relief. While there have been three rounds of stimulus payments authorized since the start of the pandemic, the most recent round, which includes up to $1,400 per person, is still being distributed by the IRS.

The claim of a fourth $2,000 stimulus payment by Memorial Day is false; Congress only approved three rounds.

It's important to note that misinformation has been circulating regarding a fourth round of stimulus payments and incorrect child tax credit amounts. The child tax credit for 2021 will provide $250 to $300 per child between July and December, not $300 to $500 as claimed.

More than 50 House members and 21 senators have expressed support for recurring stimulus payments, but no action has been taken.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki stated that the discussion about a fourth round of payments is up to Congress. "The claim of a fourth $2,000 stimulus payment by Memorial Day is false; Congress only approved three rounds," Psaki said.

So far, 164 million payments totaling $386 billion have been sent in the third-round stimulus.

In summary, the claim of a fourth stimulus payment of $2,000 per person by Memorial Day weekend is false. Congress has not approved any such payment, and the IRS is still distributing the third round of payments. While there has been discussion among lawmakers about recurring stimulus payments, no action has been taken. We urge readers to be cautious of misinformation and to rely on credible sources for updates on COVID-19 relief efforts.
