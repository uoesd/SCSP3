Chris Cuomo's Thanksgiving Rant: CNN Host Dismisses Historical Context, Expresses Frustration with 'Woke Folks'

In a bizarre turn of events, CNN host Chris Cuomo was seen loading Christmas wreaths into his Tesla on Thanksgiving Day, just hours before taking to his SiriusXM radio show to air his grievances about cancel culture and the historical context of Thanksgiving.

According to onlookers, Cuomo and his wife Cristina were spotted picking out Christmas decorations in Amagansett, New York, on Thursday morning. However, it was his comments on his radio show that have raised eyebrows and sparked controversy.

During his show, Cuomo expressed frustration with what he called "woke folks" who are "ruining" Thanksgiving, which he referred to as his favorite holiday. He dismissed the historical context of the holiday, stating that he doesn't care about the pilgrims or indigenous peoples for the purpose of the holiday.

"Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday. I don't care about the pilgrims or the indigenous peoples. I care about my family, my friends, and having a good time," Cuomo said. "These woke folks are trying to take away our traditions, our history, and our fun. They're ruining everything."

Cuomo's comments come as his brother, disgraced former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, shared a positive Thanksgiving message on the same day. Andrew Cuomo resigned in August after allegations of sexual harassment were substantiated in a report by the New York Attorney General.

Despite the controversy surrounding his brother's resignation, Chris Cuomo's popularity has taken a hit in recent months. His primetime CNN show, Cuomo Prime Time, hit an all-time low in ratings this month, according to Nielsen Media Research. The show drew 684,000 total average viewers last week, a significant drop from its debut in June 2018.

However, Cuomo Prime Time remains CNN's highest-rated show as of August, despite the decline in ratings. It's worth noting that Chris Cuomo's popularity has waned following his brother's resignation amid sexual misconduct allegations.

Cuomo's comments on his radio show have sparked outrage on social media, with many accusing him of being insensitive and dismissive of the historical trauma faced by indigenous peoples. Others have criticized his stance on cancel culture, arguing that it's important to acknowledge and learn from the past.

This isn't the first time Chris Cuomo has found himself in hot water. In August, he faced backlash for his response to a caller on his radio show who used a racial slur. Cuomo was criticized for not immediately addressing the issue and for allowing the caller to continue speaking.

The controversy surrounding Chris Cuomo's comments on Thanksgiving and cancel culture comes at a time when the holiday season is in full swing. Many are calling for a more inclusive and culturally sensitive approach to the holidays, one that acknowledges the historical trauma faced by indigenous peoples and other marginalized communities.

In light of Cuomo's comments, it's clear that there is still much work to be done in terms of educating the public about the importance of cultural sensitivity and awareness. As we move forward into the holiday season, it's important to remember the impact that our words and actions can have on others, and to strive for a more inclusive and compassionate society.

In conclusion, Chris Cuomo's Thanksgiving rant has sparked controversy and outrage, highlighting the need for greater cultural awareness and sensitivity. As we celebrate the holidays, it's important to remember the historical context and the impact that our actions and words can have on others. By doing so, we can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society for all.
