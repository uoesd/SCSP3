A New Chapter in Afghanistan: A Speech by President Joe Biden

My fellow Americans,

Today, I want to address the situation in Afghanistan and the decision to withdraw our troops from the country. The developments in Afghanistan have been rapid, and we have executed our evacuation plans with precision and care.

First and foremost, I want to acknowledge the bravery and sacrifice of our troops who have served in Afghanistan. The war in Afghanistan has been a long and difficult one, and we owe a great debt of gratitude to those who have fought and sacrificed for our country.

As we all know, the original goals of the Afghanistan mission were to combat al Qaeda and prevent terrorist attacks on the American homeland. We have been successful in these efforts, and al Qaeda is significantly weaker today than it was when we first entered Afghanistan.

However, our mission in Afghanistan has evolved over time, and we have found ourselves in a nation-building exercise. This was not our original intention, and I believe it is time for us to refocus our efforts on contemporary threats.

To that end, we have been working to develop an over-the-horizon capability for counterterrorism efforts. This will allow us to continue to protect the American people from threats emanating from Afghanistan without the need for a large military presence on the ground.

I want to be clear: the decision to withdraw our troops from Afghanistan was not taken lightly. We inherited a withdrawal agreement negotiated by former President Trump, which left us with limited options.

Despite this, I believe the decision to withdraw was the right one. There was never a "good time" to withdraw our forces from Afghanistan, but we cannot continue to bear the burden of fighting a conflict that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves.

The rapid collapse of Afghan political leadership and military is a stark reminder of the limitations of our power. We have provided significant support to the Afghan military over the years, but we cannot instill the will to fight for their future.

I want to take a moment to criticize Afghan leaders for not uniting politically and failing to negotiate a political settlement with the Taliban. This lack of political will has made it impossible for us to achieve our goals in Afghanistan.

I also want to acknowledge the personal impact of the war in Afghanistan, especially for our veterans and their families. The war has been a heavy burden for them, and we must do everything in our power to support them as they return home.

As we move forward, we will continue to work with our allies and partners to ensure that Afghanistan does not become a safe haven for terrorists. We will also continue to support the Afghan people as they build a better future for themselves.

In conclusion, the war in Afghanistan has been a difficult and trying chapter in our nation's history. But I believe that we have made the right decision in withdrawing our troops and refocusing our efforts on contemporary threats.

We will continue to work towards a more peaceful and secure world, and we will always remember the sacrifices of those who have served in Afghanistan.

Thank you, and may God bless the United States of America.
