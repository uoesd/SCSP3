John Schneider's Studios Damaged in Hurricane Ida, Iconic General Lee Cars Affected

In the wake of Hurricane Ida's destruction, actor John Schneider's studios in Holden, Louisiana, have suffered significant damage, with two iconic General Lee cars from the popular television show "The Dukes of Hazzard" being affected. One of the cars was crushed by the storm, while another was found stuck in a tree.

Despite the devastation, Schneider, who played Bo Duke in the series, has chosen to react with laughter. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he joked, "Well, I guess that's one way to get a General Lee car to fly!"

The General Lee car has been a source of controversy in recent years due to its association with the Confederate flag and its naming after Civil War General Robert E. Lee. In 2015, TV Land and Warner Bros. responded to the controversy by ceasing reruns of the show and stopping production of General Lee toy cars.

Schneider, however, has defended the General Lee, stating that it never caused issues with African American fans and emphasizing the unifying nature of the show. He believes that the characterization of the show as divisive is unfair and might impact its legacy.

In addition to his efforts to rebuild his studios, Schneider is actively participating in hurricane relief efforts in Tennessee and encourages support for those affected by natural disasters. He has requested help for the damaged studios through his studio's website and suggests donations for broader hurricane relief efforts be made to the United Way of Southeast Louisiana or the Red Cross.

Schneider expressed his gratitude for the support he has received, saying, "I'm overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and assistance from fans and friends. It's a reminder that even in the toughest times, we can come together and make a difference."

In conclusion, while Hurricane Ida's impact on John Schneider's studios and the General Lee cars is unfortunate, it is heartening to see the actor's resilience and commitment to helping those affected by natural disasters. As Schneider said, "We'll rebuild, we'll recover, and we'll do it together."
