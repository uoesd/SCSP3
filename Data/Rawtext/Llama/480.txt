Ukrainian Couple Auctions Handcuffs After 123-Day Relationship Experiment

KYIV (Reuters) – In a unique attempt to mend their intermittently failing relationship, Ukrainian couple Alexandr Kudlay and Viktoria Pustovitova spent 123 days handcuffed together, documenting their journey on social media and gaining a following. However, the experiment ultimately ended in heartbreak, with the couple deciding to auction off the handcuffs and donate part of the proceeds to charity.

"I missed having personal space and felt neglected despite the constant proximity to Alexandr," said Pustovitova, a 29-year-old beautician. "I realized that we were not well-matched as a couple," added Kudlay, a 33-year-old car salesman.

The couple started their handcuffed journey on Valentine's Day, hoping to strengthen their bond and overcome their relationship struggles. They experienced every daily activity together, from showering and eating to working and sleeping, and shared their experiences with their growing social media following.

Pustovitova expressed her emotional struggle during the breakup, reflecting on the lesson learned from their experience. "It was a difficult decision to make, but we realized that we were not meant to be together," she said.

Despite their separation, the couple decided to auction off the handcuffs they used during their experiment, with part of the proceeds going to charity. The auction was attended by Ukrainian TV news channels and a record book representative, solidifying their place in history as the couple who remained handcuffed together for the longest period.

The couple's final Instagram post depicted them standing apart, signaling the end of their unique journey together. "We are grateful for the support and attention we received during our experiment, but we have decided to move on and focus on our individual lives," said Kudlay.

Their separation was made official in a public event, marking the end of their 123-day handcuffed adventure. "We hope that our story will inspire others to take risks and try new things, even if it means stepping out of their comfort zone," said Pustovitova.

The couple's decision to auction off the handcuffs and donate part of the proceeds to charity is a testament to their commitment to giving back to their community. "We are grateful for the opportunity to make a difference and hope that our contribution will inspire others to do the same," said Kudlay.

In the end, Pustovitova and Kudlay's handcuffed experiment may not have saved their relationship, but it has left a lasting impact on their lives and the lives of those around them. "We will always cherish the memories we made during our time together, and we wish each other all the best in our future endeavors," said Pustovitova.

Their unique journey may be over, but the lessons they learned and the impact they made will be remembered for years to come. As they move on to the next chapter of their lives, they will always have the handcuffs they used during their experiment as a reminder of the adventure they shared together.
