US offers $10 million reward for information on DarkSide cybercrime leaders

DW - 11 – Washington, DC - The US State Department has announced a $10 million reward for information leading to the identification or location of the leaders of the cybercrime group DarkSide. The group is blamed for a major cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline in May, which resulted in a shutdown that led to increased gas prices and fuel shortages in the southeastern US.

In addition to the $10 million reward, the State Department is offering an additional reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of anyone involved in DarkSide ransomware incidents. This initiative is part of the US's efforts to combat the increasing trend of cyber-extortion attacks.

The FBI identifies DarkSide as a Russia-based group, and the US Justice Department has recovered about $2.3 million in Bitcoin paid by Colonial Pipeline as ransom. The world's largest meat processor, JBS, also reported paying $11 million in ransom to another Russian group, REvil.

According to US authorities, $590 million in ransomware-related payments were made in the first half of 2021, a 42% increase over the entire year of 2020. Ransomware cyber-extortion involves breaking into a network, encrypting data, and demanding cryptocurrency for decryption keys.

The Colonial Pipeline attack was a major incident that highlighted the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber threats. The pipeline, which transports nearly half of the East Coast's fuel supply, was forced to shut down for several days, causing widespread disruption and panic buying.

The incident also raised concerns about the use of cryptocurrency in ransomware attacks. The FBI has warned that cybercriminals are increasingly demanding payment in cryptocurrency, which can be difficult to trace and recover.

In response to the growing threat of ransomware attacks, the US government has launched a number of initiatives to combat cybercrime. The State Department's reward offer is part of this effort, and is intended to encourage individuals with information about DarkSide to come forward.

The US is also working with international partners to address the issue of cybercrime. The European Union's law enforcement agency, Europol, has also issued a warning about the growing threat of ransomware attacks.

In addition to the reward offer, the US government is urging businesses and individuals to take steps to protect themselves against ransomware attacks. This includes regularly backing up data, keeping software up to date, and being cautious when opening emails or clicking on links.

The rise of ransomware attacks has become a major concern for businesses and individuals alike. The Colonial Pipeline attack and the JBS incident are just two examples of the devastating impact that these attacks can have.

As cybercriminals continue to evolve and adapt their tactics, it is essential that individuals and organizations take proactive steps to protect themselves. The US government's reward offer is a positive step in the fight against cybercrime, and it is hoped that it will lead to the identification and prosecution of those responsible for these attacks.

In conclusion, the US State Department's $10 million reward offer for information on DarkSide's leaders is a significant development in the fight against cybercrime. The growing threat of ransomware attacks is a major concern for businesses and individuals alike, and it is essential that individuals and organizations take proactive steps to protect themselves. With international cooperation and initiatives like the State Department's reward offer, it is hoped that the threat of cybercrime can be mitigated.
