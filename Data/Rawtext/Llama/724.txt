Threat Assessment Teams Gain Traction in Schools Amid Rising Concerns Over Violence

In the aftermath of a Virginia student's threat of ethnic cleansing at his school, which led to the discovery of a loaded semiautomatic pistol at his home, educators and law enforcement officials are grappling with how to better identify and prevent potential threats in schools. One approach gaining traction is the use of threat assessment teams, which bring together administrators, mental health professionals, and school-based police officers to evaluate potential threats and take appropriate action.

According to Dewey Cornell, a scholar who has studied school violence prevention, "Threat assessment is a way of identifying students who may be at risk of engaging in violent behavior and providing them with support and intervention before they act out." Cornell notes that while school counselors and teachers often face challenges in identifying which students might commit violence, threat assessment teams can help to fill this gap by examining a range of factors, including a student's social media activity and access to weapons.

The tragic mass shooting at Oxford, Michigan, which left four students dead and seven others injured, highlighted potential shortcomings in identifying and acting upon threats. In that case, Ethan Crumbley, the 15-year-old suspect, was not removed from school despite alarming behavior that some experts say could have been a red flag.

Melissa Reeves, former president of the National Association of School Psychologists, emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary teams in assessing threats. "When you have a team that includes administrators, mental health professionals, and law enforcement, you can look at a student's behavior from multiple angles and make a more informed decision about how to intervene," she says.

The U.S. Secret Service and FBI endorse threat assessment methods as a way to prevent mass shootings at schools. In fact, Virginia became the first state to mandate threat assessment teams after the 2007 Virginia Tech mass shooting. Today, about half of American secondary schools and more than 40% of primary schools use threat assessment teams, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics.

Michele Gay, a nonprofit organization leader who founded the group Safe and Sound Schools after her daughter was killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, notes that while threat assessment teams are an important tool, they are not a panacea. "We can't just rely on threat assessment teams to keep our schools safe," she says. "We need to make sure that students and teachers are aware of the warning signs of potential violence and that they feel empowered to speak up when they see something concerning."

Katherine Schweit, a former FBI special agent and author of the book "Stop the Killing: How to End the Mass Shooting Epidemic in America," agrees. "We need to create a culture where students feel comfortable reporting concerns to teachers and administrators, and where teachers and administrators are trained to recognize the signs of potential violence," she says.

Tracy Ogren, a school psychologist with Robbinsdale Area Schools in Minnesota, notes that while threat assessment teams can be effective, they also face challenges. "One of the biggest challenges is getting buy-in from teachers and students," she says. "We need to make sure that everyone feels invested in the process and that they understand the importance of reporting concerns."

Robyn Lady, director of student services for Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia, adds that another challenge is ensuring that threat assessment teams are equipped to handle the complexities of mental health issues. "We need to make sure that our teams are trained to recognize the signs of mental health issues and that we're not criminalizing students who may be struggling," she says.

Despite these challenges, experts agree that threat assessment teams are a crucial tool in preventing school violence. As Dewey Cornell notes, "Threat assessment teams can help us identify students who may be at risk of engaging in violent behavior and provide them with the support and intervention they need to stay safe and succeed in school."

In the wake of the Oxford shooting, it's clear that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to preventing school violence. However, by combining threat assessment teams with awareness campaigns and mental health support, educators and law enforcement officials can work together to create safer, more supportive learning environments for all students.
