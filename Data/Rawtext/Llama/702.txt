Michigan Parents Plead Not Guilty in School Shooting Case

OXFORD TOWNSHIP, Mich. – James and Jennifer Crumbley, the parents of accused school shooter Ethan Crumbley, have pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges related to their son's involvement in a deadly shooting at Oxford High School.

The Crumbleys entered their pleas on Wednesday, a day after their son Ethan, 15, was charged with murder and other crimes for the shooting that killed four students and injured several others.

According to Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald, the charges against the Crumbleys stem from their alleged failure to prevent their son from carrying out the shooting, despite a series of concerning behaviors and missed warnings.

"The parents had the opportunity to intervene and prevent this tragedy, but they failed to do so," McDonald said in a statement. "Their actions were reckless and negligent, and they must be held accountable."

The incident timeline highlights a series of disturbing events leading up to the shooting. On Nov. 27, James Crumbley purchased a gun from a local store, which his son Ethan later posted about on Instagram. The next day, a teacher found Ethan searching for ammunition online at school, which was reported to school officials.

Despite these signs, school counselors did not believe Ethan posed a threat after evaluating his behavior and responses. When a third teacher discovered a disturbing note with drawings of a handgun and phrases indicating distress and violence, the school did not take immediate action.

Instead, Ethan's parents were summoned to the school, where they were shown the note. However, they refused to take their son home, and he was allowed to return to class. Shortly after his parents left the school, Ethan shot and wounded several students and a teacher before being taken into custody.

"We are deeply saddened by the events that occurred at Oxford High School," said Tim Throne, Superintendent of Oxford Community Schools. "We are cooperating fully with law enforcement and will do everything in our power to ensure the safety and well-being of our students and staff."

Following a manhunt, the Crumbleys were arrested and taken into custody. A third-party review of the events leading up to the shooting was also announced.

"We understand that there are many questions and concerns about how this tragedy occurred," said Tim Willis, Sheriff's Lieutenant. "We want to assure the community that we are committed to a thorough and transparent investigation."

The shooting has sparked outrage and calls for action to prevent similar incidents in the future.

"No child should ever have to fear for their safety in school," said McDonald. "We must do better to protect our children and ensure that they have a safe and supportive learning environment."

The community has come together to support the victims and their families, with vigils and fundraising efforts underway.

"We are grateful for the outpouring of support from the community," said Throne. "We will continue to work together to heal and move forward."

The Crumbleys are being held on $500,000 bond each and are expected to return to court for a preliminary hearing on Dec. 18. Ethan Crumbley is being held in a juvenile detention facility and will be tried as an adult.

In the wake of this tragedy, questions remain about how the shooting could have been prevented and what can be done to prevent similar incidents in the future. As the investigation continues, one thing is clear: the Oxford community will never be the same.
