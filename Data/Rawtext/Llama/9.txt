Biden Inaugurated as 46th US President, Vows to Preserve Constitution

Washington D.C. - Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States on Wednesday, January 20, 2021, in a scaled-back ceremony due to COVID-19 and security concerns. Biden was sworn in with a family heirloom Bible, and vowed to preserve the US Constitution.

The inauguration took place during a tumultuous time of political divide, economic turmoil, and a devastating pandemic. Despite this, the ceremony was attended by top Republicans and former Presidents, including Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. Notably absent was Donald Trump, who broke tradition by not attending Biden's inauguration, nor meeting with him.

Kamala Harris made history as the first Black, first woman, and first Asian American vice president. She was sworn in by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, using two Bibles, including one owned by Thurgood Marshall.

The ceremony was held at the US Capitol, where thousands of National Guard troops were deployed to ensure security following the January 6 Capitol siege. The National Mall was filled with nearly 200,000 flags and 56 pillars of light to represent US states and territories.

In his inaugural address, Biden emphasized the need for unity and healing in the country. "We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal," he said. "We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts."

Biden also addressed the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed over 400,000 lives in the US. "We will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility," he said. "Much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build, and much to gain."

The inauguration was a historic moment for the country, marking a new chapter in American politics. Biden's presidency comes at a time of great challenge, but also great opportunity for change and growth.

In conclusion, Joe Biden's inauguration as the 46th President of the United States was a momentous occasion, marked by tradition and history. Despite the challenges facing the country, the ceremony was a symbol of hope and unity, and a reminder of the strength and resilience of American democracy.
