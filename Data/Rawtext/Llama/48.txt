Race and the Capitol Riot: A Failure of Law Enforcement?

The Capitol riot on January 6th has sparked a national conversation about race and law enforcement, with many questioning whether the response of the Capitol Police would have been different if the protesters were from Black Lives Matter. Mark Anthony Neal, an African American studies professor at Duke University, suggested that the response would have been "dramatically different" if the protesters were black.

Steven Sund, the former Chief of the Capitol Police, has faced criticism for his leadership and the preparedness of his department during the riot. Many have called for an independent commission to investigate the events, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has now announced.

The response of law enforcement during the Capitol riot has been contrasted with their response to Black Lives Matter protests, where law enforcement often clashed with demonstrators despite mostly peaceful protests. Brad Garrett, a retired FBI agent and ABC News contributor, noted that the Capitol riot was a "failure of law enforcement" and that the Capitol Police were "poorly prepared" for the event.

Jeremy Pressman, an associate professor of political science and director of Middle East studies at the University of Connecticut, pointed out that the Capitol riot is not an isolated incident, but rather part of a larger pattern of different law enforcement responses to protests based on the racial composition of the protesters. He cited the Michael Brown protests in Ferguson as an example of disproportionate police response.

President Joe Biden has also weighed in on the issue, acknowledging that there is a "problem" within law enforcement and American society when it comes to racism. The Capitol riot has prompted a reconsideration of this issue and the need for greater accountability and transparency within law enforcement.

The Capitol riot has highlighted the ongoing struggle for racial justice and equality in the United States. As the country continues to grapple with the implications of this event, it is clear that there are deep-seated issues within law enforcement and American society that must be addressed.
