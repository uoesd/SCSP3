Ida's Fury: South Jersey Reels from Devastating Storm

HARRISON TWP. – The remnants of Hurricane Ida brought destruction and chaos to South Jersey, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. The storm's powerful winds and heavy rains wreaked havoc on towns across the region, with Mullica Hill and Harrison being particularly hard hit.

"It's like a war zone out here," said Louis Manzo, Mayor of Harrison. "We've never seen anything like it. The damage is catastrophic."

Manzo reported that approximately a dozen houses in Harrison were "flattened" by the storm, with many more suffering significant damage. Despite the severity of the destruction, there were no fatalities reported in the town.

In nearby Gloucester County, two individuals were hospitalized due to the storm, according to officials.

Gov. Phil Murphy promised support for the response and recovery efforts, saying in a statement, "We are committed to doing everything we can to help those affected by this storm."

Multiple tornado warnings were issued across the region, with possible tornadoes reported in Cherry Hill and near the Delaware River in Burlington County. U.S. Rep Andy Kim, who represents New Jersey's 3rd congressional district, reported seeing a tornado and urged residents to prioritize safety and seek help if needed.

"This is a dangerous situation, and we need to make sure everyone is safe," Kim said. "I urge everyone to stay indoors and follow the instructions of local authorities."

Fallen trees, closed roads, and downed power lines were widespread, creating hazardous conditions for residents and first responders. The Red Cross and other emergency responders were active in providing assistance and emergency housing to those affected.

According to Dave Levinsky, spokesman for Burlington County, the storm's impact was severe and widespread. "We've got a lot of damage, a lot of trees down, and a lot of power outages," he said. "It's going to be a long cleanup process."

Ida is forecasted to bring drenching rainfall, severe thunderstorms, and gusts up to 25 mph to the area in the coming days, further complicating the recovery efforts.

The storm's destruction comes as New Jersey has seen a significant increase in tornado activity in 2021, with 10 tornadoes already reported this year. The state typically sees an average of 12 tornadoes per year.

As the region begins the long process of recovery, residents are being urged to remain vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities. The full extent of the damage is still being assessed, but it is clear that Ida has left a lasting impact on South Jersey.

"We're going to do everything we can to help our residents recover from this storm," said Manzo. "It's going to be a tough road ahead, but we're strong and resilient. We'll get through this together."
