Involuntary Manslaughter Charges Filed Against Parents of Michigan Teen Accused in School Shooting

PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) – In a press conference held on Friday, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald announced that involuntary manslaughter charges have been filed against James and Jennifer Crumbley, the parents of Ethan Crumbley, the 15-year-old accused of killing four students at Oxford High School.

According to McDonald, the Crumbleys failed to intervene despite numerous warnings, including a chilling drawing found at their son's desk. "The parents were required to take responsibility for their son's actions," McDonald said. "They failed to do that."

Ethan Crumbley is accused of killing four students and injuring several others during a shooting rampage at Oxford High School on Tuesday. He has been charged as an adult with murder and terrorism.

Prosecutor McDonald stated that the Crumbleys purchased a gun for Ethan, failed to secure it, and resisted efforts to remove him from school on the day of the shooting. "The parents were warned about their son's behavior, and they did nothing," McDonald said.

U.S. Marshals are offering a reward for information leading to the Crumbleys' arrest. However, the couple's attorney, Shannon Smith, claims they are not on the run. "They are going to turn themselves in," Smith said. "They want to cooperate."

School officials had previously been alarmed by Ethan's behavior, including searching for ammunition on his phone. A note with violent drawings and messages was found on Ethan's desk, and parents were told to get him counseling.

After the shooting, Jennifer Crumbley texted Ethan urging him not to proceed, and James Crumbley reported a gun missing from their home. The firearm was purchased by Ethan's father and openly posted about on social media.

Prosecutor McDonald did not rule out charges against school officials, saying the investigation is ongoing. "We're looking at everything," McDonald said. "We're going to follow the evidence where it takes us."

Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard expressed frustration with the Crumbleys' failure to take responsibility for their son's actions. "The parents had every opportunity to intervene," Bouchard said. "They failed to do so, and now we have four innocent victims."

The victims of the shooting have been identified as 16-year-old Tate Myre, 14-year-old Hana St. Juliana, 17-year-old Madisyn Baldwin, and 15-year-old Riley Franz.

The shooting has left the community in shock and grief. "This is a tragedy that should never have happened," McDonald said. "We need to take responsibility for our children's actions, and we need to take responsibility for our own actions."

The investigation into the shooting is ongoing, with authorities working to determine the motive behind the attack. "We're going to get to the bottom of this," Bouchard said. "We owe it to the victims and their families."

The Crumbleys are expected to turn themselves in to authorities soon. Their arraignment is scheduled for Monday.

In the meantime, the community is coming together to support the victims' families and to heal from the tragedy. "We're going to get through this together," Bouchard said. "We're going to support each other, and we're going to make sure that justice is served."
