Meghan Markle and Prince Harry: A Glamorous Gala and a Joyful Life as a Family of Four

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are gearing up for a glamorous gala, and their wedding glam squad is ready to make them shine. The couple's friend, makeup artist Daniel Martin, shared their joyful dynamics with PEOPLE Royals, giving a glimpse into their happy life together.

Martin, who has worked with Meghan for years, revealed that the couple's energy is infectious. "They're so happy, and they're so in love," he said. "They're just so excited to be embarking on this new chapter in their lives."

The couple's recent appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and their visit to New York City showcased their active public life. Meghan and Harry are enjoying their life as a family of four with their children, Archie and Lili, and are striving for work-life balance.

Meghan has been advocating for paid parental leave in the U.S., a cause close to her heart. "As a mom, I know how hard it is to balance work and family," she said during her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. "I think it's so important that we have paid family leave. It's not just good for the parents, it's good for the children, and it's good for society as a whole."

Prince Harry, on the other hand, has been focusing on battling misinformation and disinformation. In a recent interview, he criticized the term "Megxit" for its misogyny and how it was propagated. "I think it's a load of nonsense, to be honest with you," he said. "I don't think it's fair, and I don't think it's right."

As the couple enters their second year of independence, they are relying on each other more than ever. Their friend, hairstylist Serge Normant, noted that they are inseparable and happy. "They're just so comfortable with each other," he said. "They're like two peas in a pod."

Despite the challenges they have faced, Meghan and Harry are thriving in their new life in California. They are enjoying their time as a family and are committed to their charitable work. As they continue to forge their own path, their love and support for each other remain unwavering.

In the words of Daniel Martin, "They're just so happy, and they're so in love. They're just so excited to be embarking on this new chapter in their lives."

As the couple prepares for their glamorous gala, their joy and love for each other are sure to shine brighter than any diamond. They are truly a modern royal couple, paving their own way and living life on their own terms.
