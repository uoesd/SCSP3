Gabby Petito's Cause of Death Revealed as Strangulation, Brian Laundrie Remains Missing

The Teton County Coroner's Office has announced that Gabby Petito's cause of death has been determined to be strangulation. Dr. Brent Blue, the coroner, revealed that Petito's remains were found at a campground in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, and it is estimated that she had been deceased for 3 to 4 weeks before her body was discovered.

Dr. Blue stated that while the exact time of Petito's death cannot be determined, the manner of death has been ruled a homicide. He also noted that a whole-body CAT scan and toxicology reports were conducted as part of the autopsy.

Gabby Petito's fiancé, Brian Laundrie, has been identified as a person of interest in her case. However, he remains missing, and his whereabouts are currently unknown.

Joe Petito, Gabby's father, expressed his belief that Laundrie is alive and in hiding. "I believe he's a coward," Petito said. "He's hiding. He's not man enough to face the music."

Jim Schmidt, Gabby's stepfather, echoed Petito's sentiments. "I think he's a coward, and I think he's hiding," Schmidt said. "I don't think he has the guts to face what he's done."

Steven Bertolino, the attorney for the Laundrie family, released a statement expressing condolences for Petito's family. "The Laundrie family extends their deepest sympathies to the Petito family for their loss," Bertolino said. "Brian is still missing, and we urge anyone with information to come forward."

North Port, the city where Petito and Laundrie resided, plans to erect a permanent memorial for Petito. The memorial will replace a makeshift memorial that has been set up in her honor.

The authorities are still actively searching for Brian Laundrie and have received assistance from his father in their efforts. They urge anyone with information regarding Laundrie's whereabouts to come forward.

In a press conference, Dr. Blue emphasized the importance of the public's help in solving the case. "We need the public's assistance in bringing Brian Laundrie to justice," Blue said. "Any information, no matter how small, could be crucial in this investigation."

The case has garnered national attention, with many people following the developments and expressing their support for Petito's family on social media.

As the investigation continues, the focus remains on finding Brian Laundrie and bringing him to justice. The public is urged to remain vigilant and report any sightings or information that could help the authorities.
