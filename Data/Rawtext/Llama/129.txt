CNN's 'Cuomo Prime Time' Hits Rock Bottom as Scandals Engulf Host's Brother

In a stunning turn of events, CNN's 'Cuomo Prime Time' has experienced its lowest viewership since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, with an average of 1.31 million viewers the week of March 15. This significant drop in ratings comes amid scandals involving host Chris Cuomo's brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who faces accusations of sexual harassment, verbal threats, and covering up nursing home COVID-19 deaths.

The show's performance in the key demographic of adults aged 25-to-54 was also dismal, signaling a decline in interest among younger viewers. This comes as CNN falls behind Fox News in ratings, raising questions about the network's ability to attract and retain viewers.

CNN has faced criticism for allowing Chris Cuomo to conduct interviews with his brother during the pandemic, with some accusing the network of blurring the lines between journalism and propaganda. In response, CNN announced that Chris Cuomo would no longer cover his brother's scandals, citing a long-standing rule with a previous exception.

However, the network's decision has done little to quell the controversy, particularly given CNN executive vice president Allison Gollust's prior connections to Governor Andrew Cuomo. Gollust served as the governor's communications director from 2012 to 2013 and has been accused of helping to orchestrate a cover-up of the nursing home deaths.

Governor Andrew Cuomo has refused to resign despite the scandals and bipartisan calls for his resignation. His decision has sparked outrage among many New Yorkers, who feel that he has betrayed the public's trust.

The drop in ratings for 'Cuomo Prime Time' is a significant blow to CNN, which has long touted itself as a trusted source of news and information. The network's struggles come at a time when the media landscape is increasingly fragmented, with many viewers turning to alternative sources of information.

In recent months, CNN has faced criticism for its coverage of the pandemic, with some accusing the network of sensationalism and fear-mongering. The network's decision to allow Chris Cuomo to interview his brother has only added fuel to the fire, with many viewers expressing outrage on social media.

Despite the backlash, CNN has remained defiant, insisting that Chris Cuomo is a respected journalist who has done nothing wrong. However, the network's refusal to acknowledge the conflict of interest has only served to further erode trust among viewers.

The scandals surrounding Governor Andrew Cuomo have also raised questions about the role of the media in holding those in power accountable. With the governor refusing to resign, many are left wondering whether the media has the power to effect change in the face of such blatant corruption.

As 'Cuomo Prime Time' struggles to regain its footing, CNN finds itself at a crossroads. The network must decide whether to continue to stand by its embattled host or to take a step back and reassess its priorities.

For now, it seems that viewers have already made their decision, with 'Cuomo Prime Time's' ratings plummeting to an all-time low. Whether the show can recover remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the controversy surrounding Chris Cuomo and his brother is far from over.
