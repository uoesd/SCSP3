WHO Grants Emergency Use Listing for Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 Vaccine

Geneva, Switzerland - The World Health Organization (WHO) has validated the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, assuring that it meets international standards for safety, efficacy, and manufacturing. This milestone marks a significant step towards addressing the global access inequity of COVID-19 vaccines.

Dr. Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products, emphasized the importance of multiple COVID-19 vaccines in addressing the pandemic. "We need multiple vaccines to address the global demand and ensure equitable access to vaccines, particularly for low- and middle-income countries," she said.

The WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply and international procurement. The EUL process assesses novel health products during public health emergencies, focusing on safety, efficacy, and quality. The WHO assessment of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine included on-site inspections of its production facility.

The Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine is suitable for low-resource settings due to its easy storage requirements. It is recommended for adults 18 years and older, with a two-dose schedule. Vaccine efficacy results showed it prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of recipients and severe COVID-19 and hospitalization in 100% of the studied population.

While efficacy in older adults (over 60 years) could not be estimated from trials, the WHO does not recommend an upper age limit due to supportive data. "We are confident that this vaccine will be an important tool in the fight against COVID-19, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where access to vaccines has been a challenge," said Dr. Simão.

The WHO's validation of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine is a significant step towards ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines globally. With this Emergency Use Listing, the vaccine can now be procured and distributed through the COVAX Facility, which aims to provide vaccines to up to 20% of the population in participating countries.

In conclusion, the WHO's validation of the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use is a crucial step towards addressing the global access inequity of COVID-19 vaccines. With its easy storage requirements and two-dose schedule, this vaccine has the potential to make a significant impact in low-resource settings. The WHO will continue to work towards ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for those who need them most.
