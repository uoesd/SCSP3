Biden Tours Flood-Ravaged New Jersey, Calls for Climate Action

President Joe Biden visited flood-stricken areas of New Jersey on Tuesday, surveying the devastation left by Hurricane Ida's torrential rains. The president emphasized the urgent need for action on climate change, citing the increasing frequency of extreme weather events across the country.

"We're seeing the effects of climate change all around us," Biden said during a briefing in Manville, New Jersey. "We've got to take action, and we've got to take it now."

Biden approved major disaster declarations for affected counties in New Jersey and New York, unlocking federal aid for the hardest-hit areas. The president also announced plans to visit New York City to assess the damage and meet with local officials.

Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm, causing widespread destruction and flooding. The storm's remnants brought record rainfall to the Northeast, resulting in over 50 deaths across six states.

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy warned that the clean-up and rebuilding process would take months, with many communities facing a long and difficult recovery.

"We're in this for the long haul," Murphy said during a press conference. "We'll do everything we can to support our communities and help them rebuild."

Biden previously visited Louisiana to assess the damage from Hurricane Ida's initial landfall. The president highlighted the need for federal spending on infrastructure to better defend against future storms.

"We can't keep rebuilding the same way we've been building," Biden said. "We need to build back better, build back stronger, and build back more resilient."

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki emphasized the widespread impact of severe weather across the US, citing recent flooding in the Midwest and wildfires in the West.

"The effects of climate change are being felt all across the country," Psaki said during a press briefing. "The president is committed to taking action to address this crisis."

Biden's visit to New Jersey and New York is expected to focus attention on the need for climate action, as well as the importance of investing in infrastructure to protect against extreme weather events.

The president's trip comes as Congress considers a major infrastructure package, with Democrats pushing for a bill that includes funding for climate resilience and green infrastructure.

As the US continues to grapple with the devastating impacts of Hurricane Ida, Biden's visit serves as a reminder of the urgent need for action on climate change. The president's call for action is likely to resonate with many Americans, who are increasingly concerned about the growing frequency and severity of extreme weather events.

In the wake of Hurricane Ida, there is a growing recognition that the US must do more to prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change. Biden's visit to New Jersey and New York is a step towards addressing this crisis, and a reminder that the federal government has a critical role to play in supporting communities affected by extreme weather events.

As the US looks to the future, it is clear that the impacts of climate change will only continue to grow more severe. The question is whether the country will take action to address this crisis, or continue to pay the price for inaction.

For now, the focus is on supporting the communities affected by Hurricane Ida, and ensuring that they have the resources they need to recover and rebuild. As Biden said during his visit to New Jersey, "We're in this together, and we'll get through it together."
