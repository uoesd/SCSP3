Facebook Shuts Down Pro-Israel Page with 77 Million Followers, Citing Violations

In a controversial move, Facebook has shut down the popular pro-Israel "Jerusalem Prayer Group" page, which had amassed a staggering 77 million followers. The social media giant cited violations of its rules against spam and inauthentic behavior as the reason for the shutdown.

Mike Evans, the founder of the page and head of the Friends of Zion Association, claimed that the shutdown was a result of a "cyber terrorism" campaign by radical Islamic groups. According to Evans, the campaign involved over a million comments and included anti-Semitic content such as photos of and quotes by Hitler.

Evans alleged that the campaign was coordinated to flood the page with hate speech and false complaints, leading to Facebook's decision to remove the page. He claimed that he has not been able to contact Facebook representatives since the page was shut down and that he cannot post to his personal Facebook page.

The page's shutdown came as a surprise to Evans, who was informed of the decision upon arriving in Israel to host a star-studded TV special. In May 2019, Facebook had removed over 200 "fake accounts" for inauthentic behavior.

Evans has reached out to several politicians, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, Sen. Ted Cruz, Jared Kushner, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for support. He described the page's shutdown as a result of bias and labeled it as "cyber terrorism based upon racism."

A Facebook spokesperson confirmed that the page was removed for violating Facebook's rules against spam and inauthentic behavior. However, the company did not provide further details on the specific violations that led to the shutdown.

The shutdown of the Jerusalem Prayer Group page has sparked outrage among pro-Israel groups and individuals, who see it as an attack on their freedom of speech and expression. Some have accused Facebook of bias against Israel and the Jewish community.

The shutdown of the Jerusalem Prayer Group page has highlighted the ongoing debate over the role of social media in regulating free speech and expression. While Facebook has a responsibility to protect its users from hate speech and other forms of harmful content, some argue that the company has a bias against certain groups and viewpoints.

In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said, "We removed the Jerusalem Prayer Group page for violating our rules against spam and inauthentic behavior. We take these violations very seriously and will not tolerate them on our platform."

Mike Evans, founder of the Jerusalem Prayer Group, expressed his disappointment and frustration with Facebook's decision, saying, "This is a clear case of cyber terrorism based upon racism. We will not be silenced and will continue to fight for the rights of the Jewish people and the state of Israel."
