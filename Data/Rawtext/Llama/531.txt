Insurers Face $1 Billion Hit from Hurricane Ida's Offshore Rig Damage

Sept 3 (Reuters) – Insurers are bracing for a potential $1 billion hit from physical damage to offshore rigs caused by Hurricane Ida, according to the latest estimate. The storm's impact on Louisiana refinery operations and the U.S. crude supply chain has already been significant, and utility disruptions could lead to prolonged claims reporting and payouts.

The estimate, provided by Karen Clark & Co, excludes losses from production disruption and may be revised as the full extent of the damage becomes clearer. The company estimated that total losses in the US and the Caribbean could reach $18 billion.

CoreLogic, a data and analytics company, estimated that insured flood losses in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama could range from $6 billion to $9 billion, while wind losses could reach $8 billion to $12 billion. With flash flooding killing at least 44 people in four Northeastern states, total losses could approach $30 billion.

William Liebler, U.S. Chief Claims Officer at Marsh, commented on the expected influx of claims, saying, "We expect to see a significant number of claims coming in over the next few days, particularly for water damage."

AIR Worldwide, a risk modeling firm, estimated that insured losses from Hurricane Ida could range from $17 billion to $25 billion.

The storm's impact on the Northeast has been severe, with significant water damage expected. The bulk of claims are anticipated in the following days, and insurers are preparing for a busy period ahead.

As the full extent of Hurricane Ida's damage becomes clearer, insurers are bracing for a costly and complex claims process. With the potential for billions of dollars in losses, the industry is gearing up for a challenging period ahead.
