A Nation in Mourning: President Biden Addresses Terror Attack on Kabul Airport

My fellow Americans,

I stand before you today with a heavy heart, as I address the heinous terror attack that occurred at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. The attack, carried out by the brutal terrorist group ISIS-K, has resulted in the loss of American service members and civilians, and my heart goes out to their families and loved ones.

I want to assure the nation that I have been in constant contact with our military commanders, and we are still in the process of gathering information and assessing the situation. But let me be clear: we will not be deterred by these cowardly acts. We will not be intimidated by the terrorists who seek to undermine our values and our way of life.

I want to take a moment to honor the brave men and women who have given their lives in service to our country. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten, and we will continue to do everything in our power to ensure that their families receive the support and care they deserve.

I also want to express my deepest gratitude to the heroic service members and civilians who were part of the significant evacuation effort that has taken place over the past 11 days. More than 100,000 individuals have been evacuated from Afghanistan, and their bravery and selflessness are truly inspiring.

To the families of the fallen, I want to assure you that we will do everything in our power to support you in the days and weeks ahead. We will be with you every step of the way, and we will never forget the sacrifices that your loved ones have made.

To the perpetrators of this heinous attack, I want to make one thing clear: we will not forgive, we will not forget, and we will hunt you down and make you pay. We will not be deterred by your barbaric acts, and we will continue to do everything in our power to protect our citizens and our allies.

In response to this attack, I have ordered the development of operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. We will not rest until those responsible for this attack are brought to justice.

Despite this tragic event, our mission to evacuate American citizens and Afghan allies will continue. We will not be deterred by the terrorists who seek to undermine our values and our way of life. We will continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety and security of those who have helped us and those who are in need.

Before I conclude, I want to ask for a moment of silence for those who have given their lives in service to our country. Let us honor their memory, and let us continue to work together to ensure that their sacrifice is never forgotten.

Thank you, and may God bless the United States of America.
