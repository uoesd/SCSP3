Cassidy at Peace with Impeachment Vote Despite Backlash

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) – U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, has faced criticism and censure from his party for his vote to convict former President Donald Trump at his impeachment trial, but he says he is "at peace" with his decision.

Cassidy was one of seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. His vote diverged from Louisiana's other U.S. senator, John Kennedy, who voted against conviction.

Despite backlash, Cassidy has received support and respect from some Republicans for his decision. He stands by his oath to support and defend the Constitution and believes his vote was in line with that oath.

The 57-43 Senate vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump. Some Republicans who acquitted Trump disputed the evidence or rejected Congress's jurisdiction over a former president.

Cassidy has sought to focus on other issues since the impeachment trial, including President Joe Biden's cabinet confirmations and weather recovery efforts. However, Trump supporters continue to criticize Cassidy, leading to calls for his exclusion from Republican events and more local GOP groups condemning his vote.

The Louisiana Republican Party censured Cassidy for his vote, but he believes this does not represent the broader party opinion. He maintains that his vote was not a political decision, but rather a decision based on his interpretation of the evidence presented during the trial.

Cassidy has faced criticism from some Louisiana Republicans who view his vote as a betrayal of the party and its values. However, he has also received support from some Republicans who believe he made the right decision based on the evidence presented.

The impeachment trial and its aftermath have highlighted divisions within the Republican Party, with some members standing by Trump and others criticizing his actions. Cassidy's vote has placed him at odds with some members of his party, but he remains committed to his principles and his oath to the Constitution.
