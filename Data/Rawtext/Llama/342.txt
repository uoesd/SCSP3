False Claims of Navy SEALs Rescuing Trafficked Children from Ever Given Ship in Suez Canal Debunked

A story claiming that U.S. Navy SEALs rescued over a thousand trafficked children from the Ever Given ship in the Suez Canal has been circulating online, but it is entirely false. The story originated from Before It's News, a website known for publishing false and misleading content. No credible news publisher or government entity has confirmed the story of the rescue operation.

The Ever Given cargo ship did indeed become stuck in the Suez Canal in March 2021, causing a significant maritime traffic jam. However, there is no evidence to suggest that any children were rescued from the ship, let alone over a thousand trafficked children.

The false story also claimed that Weapons of Mass Destruction were found on the ship. This claim is also unfounded and has not been reported by any reputable news source.

It was also falsely stated that the ship was co-owned by Walmart and the Clinton Foundation, implicating them in an international child trafficking ring. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and both Walmart and the Clinton Foundation have denied any involvement in such activities.

The story suggested that trafficked children were ordered through catalogs like Wayfair by pedophiles. This claim is also baseless and has been debunked in the past. There is no evidence to suggest that Wayfair or any other online retailer is involved in child trafficking.

A non-existent 'telegram' claiming the U.S. Navy SEALs had found live and dead children in cargo containers was also mentioned in the false story. This claim is entirely unfounded and has not been reported by any credible source.

Similar baseless trafficking claims were made about the Wayfair online shopping website in July 2020. These claims were also debunked, and there is no evidence to suggest that Wayfair is involved in child trafficking.

It is important to note that child trafficking is a serious issue that affects millions of children around the world. However, spreading false information and baseless conspiracy theories does not help to combat this problem. Instead, it distracts from the real issues and can cause harm to innocent people and organizations.

It is crucial to fact-check information before sharing it online. In this case, a simple fact-check would have revealed that the story of the Navy SEALs rescuing trafficked children from the Ever Given ship is entirely false.

In conclusion, there is no evidence to support the claims that U.S. Navy SEALs rescued over a thousand trafficked children from the Ever Given ship in the Suez Canal. The story is entirely false and has been debunked. It is important to be vigilant and fact-check information before sharing it online to avoid spreading false information and baseless conspiracy theories.
