Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Use Son's Birthday to Advocate for COVID-19 Vaccine Equity

London – Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have marked their son Archie's second birthday by advocating for COVID-19 vaccine equity. In a statement released on Wednesday, the couple announced their partnership with Archewell, their charitable organization, to support vaccine donations.

The Sussexes have highlighted the global disparity in vaccine distribution, with 80% of doses administered in wealthier nations. They emphasized the importance of global solidarity and compassion in overcoming the pandemic. "We are proud to be part of a global community that is working together to ensure that everyone, everywhere has access to the vaccines they need to protect themselves and their families," the couple said in their statement.

To support their cause, the Sussexes have launched a fundraising campaign with Archewell. For every $5 donation, a number of organizations will contribute $15, enough to cover four vaccine doses. The couple acknowledged the support and acts of charity from the public in honor of Archie's previous birthdays and expressed their gratitude for the continued generosity.

Archewell is collaborating with Global Citizen and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to promote worldwide vaccine access. The organization is urging pharmaceutical companies to support the COVAX initiative, which aims to ensure equitable vaccine access for lower-income countries. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have sent an open letter to pharmaceutical companies, urging them to do more to support the COVAX initiative.

The Sussexes have stressed the importance of vaccine equity, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. "The pandemic has shown us that we are all connected and that we must work together to overcome global challenges," they said. "We must also recognize that the vaccines are a shared resource and that we must work together to ensure that everyone has access to them."

In a correction issued later, the Sussexes clarified that multiple organizations will match donations, not the Sussexes themselves. The couple's statement has sparked a global conversation about vaccine equity and the importance of global solidarity in overcoming the pandemic.

In conclusion, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's advocacy for COVID-19 vaccine equity on their son Archie's second birthday is a powerful reminder of the importance of global solidarity and compassion. Their partnership with Archewell and collaboration with Global Citizen and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, demonstrates their commitment to ensuring that everyone, everywhere has access to the vaccines they need to protect themselves and their families.
