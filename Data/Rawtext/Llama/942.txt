Historic First: Stacey Plaskett Becomes First Delegate to Serve as Impeachment Manager

In a historic moment during the Senate trial of former President Donald Trump, Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin from Maryland introduced Stacey Plaskett, the first delegate in American history to be part of a team of impeachment managers. Plaskett, who represents the US Virgin Islands' at-large congressional district, is currently in her fourth term and is one of nine House Democrats serving as impeachment managers for the trial.

Despite being unable to cast votes on the House floor, including the impeachment vote against Trump, Plaskett is participating in the Senate trial as a prosecutor, aiming to prove Trump incited an insurrection. "I am proud to be part of this team of impeachment managers, and I am committed to presenting the truth and ensuring that justice is served," Plaskett said in a statement.

Raskin, who was Plaskett's law professor, commended her academic excellence and current performance. "Stacey Plaskett is an outstanding lawyer and a dedicated public servant. She has been an asset to the House of Representatives, and I have no doubt that she will excel in her role as an impeachment manager," Raskin said.

Plaskett emphasized her personal and professional journey, highlighting her background and commitment to truth and preparation. "I come from a small island in the Caribbean, and I have worked hard to get to where I am today. I am committed to doing my part to ensure that the truth is heard and that justice is served," Plaskett said.

Before Congress, Plaskett worked as an assistant district attorney and senior counsel at the US Department of Justice. Her experience and expertise have been invaluable in her role as an impeachment manager. "I have spent my career fighting for justice and upholding the law. I am proud to continue that work as an impeachment manager," Plaskett said.

There are currently five delegates representing various non-state territories in the House of Representatives. Plaskett's historic appointment as an impeachment manager highlights the important role that these delegates play in the legislative process. "I am honored to be a part of this historic moment, and I am committed to doing my part to ensure that the voices of the people of the US Virgin Islands are heard," Plaskett said.

Plaskett's appointment as an impeachment manager is a testament to her dedication to justice and her commitment to upholding the Constitution. As the trial continues, Plaskett will play a critical role in presenting the case against Trump and ensuring that justice is served.

In conclusion, Stacey Plaskett's historic appointment as the first delegate to serve as an impeachment manager is a significant moment in American history. Her commitment to truth, justice, and preparation will be invaluable in her role as a prosecutor in the Senate trial of former President Donald Trump.
