WHO Designates Omicron as Variant of Concern, Urges Enhanced Surveillance and Public Health Measures

Geneva, Switzerland - The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated the B.1.1.529 variant, named Omicron, as a variant of concern, following a meeting of the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee on 26 November 2021. The variant has several mutations that may affect its transmissibility and the severity of the disease it causes.

Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron compared to other variants of concern. However, it is unclear if Omicron is more transmissible or causes more severe disease than other variants, including Delta. Further research is needed to better understand the characteristics and impact of Omicron.

Current vaccines remain critical to reducing severe disease and death, including against Delta. PCR tests continue to detect Omicron, and studies are ongoing to assess the variant's impact on other types of tests and current treatments. WHO is coordinating global research efforts to better understand Omicron's characteristics and impact.

WHO recommends that countries enhance surveillance, share data, report cases, and perform investigations to understand Omicron better. Countries should also implement effective public health measures and address inequities in access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Individuals should maintain preventive measures such as physical distancing, wearing masks, and getting vaccinated.

"The emergence of the Omicron variant highlights the ongoing evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for continued vigilance and cooperation from all countries," said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. "We must work together to better understand this variant and protect populations from its potential impact."

WHO has provided guidance to countries on how to respond to the Omicron variant, including enhancing surveillance, conducting field investigations, and increasing public awareness and education. The organization will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide updates as new information becomes available.

"We urge countries to take this variant seriously and take immediate actions to slow its spread," said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, Technical Lead for COVID-19 at WHO. "We are working closely with our partners to better understand this variant and ensure that countries have the tools and resources they need to respond effectively."

In addition to the measures recommended by WHO, countries are advised to maintain a high level of vigilance and preparedness, including enhancing surveillance and detection capabilities, strengthening public health infrastructure, and ensuring that healthcare systems are able to cope with an increased caseload.

The emergence of the Omicron variant serves as a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over and that continued efforts are needed to protect populations and prevent the spread of the virus. WHO will continue to work closely with countries and partners to monitor the situation and provide updates as new information becomes available.
