New Beginnings and Unity: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris Set to Make History in Inauguration Ceremony

In a ceremony that promises to be a celebration of diversity, unity, and new beginnings, Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, 2023. The inauguration, which will take place on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol, will also mark a historic moment for Kamala Harris, who will become the country's first female, Black, and South Asian vice president.

"This inauguration is an opportunity for us to come together as a nation and celebrate a new beginning," said Tony Allen, CEO of the inauguration committee. "We want to showcase the diversity and youth of our country, and to restore the soul of America."

The ceremony will feature a number of historic firsts, including the swearing-in of Kamala Harris by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. This will be a significant moment, as both Harris and Sotomayor are "firsts" in their respective fields. Harris will use two Bibles for her swearing-in, one owned by Regina Shelton and another by Thurgood Marshall, symbolizing the significant personal and historical influences in her life.

Reverend Leo O'Donovan, a longtime friend of the Biden family, will deliver the invocation prayer, while Andrea Hall, the first Black woman to be promoted to Fire Captain in Fulton County, Georgia, will lead the Pledge of Allegiance. Amanda Gorman, the United States' first national youth poet laureate, will deliver a poetry reading, adding to the ceremony's focus on youth and diversity.

Pastor Silvester Beaman from Wilmington, Delaware, will deliver the benediction, highlighting his close relationship with the Biden family. "I'm honored to be a part of this historic moment," said Beaman. "I've known the Biden family for many years, and I'm excited to see them take on this new chapter in their lives."

The ceremony will also feature attendance from former US presidents, members of Congress, celebrities, and other notable guests. "We want to make sure that this inauguration is inclusive and representative of the American people," said Allen. "We're excited to have so many distinguished guests join us for this special occasion."

Overall, the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris promises to be a momentous occasion, marked by a focus on unity, diversity, and new beginnings. As the country looks to the future with hope and optimism, this ceremony will serve as a reminder of the progress that has been made, and the work that still needs to be done.

"This inauguration is a chance for us to come together and celebrate the best of America," said Allen. "We're excited to kick off this new chapter in our nation's history, and to work towards a brighter future for all Americans."
