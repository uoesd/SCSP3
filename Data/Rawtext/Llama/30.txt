New Radicals Reunite for Biden-Harris Inaugural Parade, Bringing Message of Hope and Resilience

After 22 years, the band New Radicals has reunited to perform their hit song "You Get What You Give" for the Biden-Harris virtual inaugural parade. The band, which was essentially a duo consisting of singer Gregg Alexander and percussionist Danielle Brisebois, was known for their critically acclaimed album 'Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too,' released in 1998.

"You Get What You Give" has become a classic, celebrated for its optimistic message and its significance to the Biden family. The song was used by President Biden's late son Beau as a psych-up song during chemotherapy treatments. Despite the song's success, New Radicals dissolved before releasing their second single, as Alexander found the spotlight too stressful.

However, the band's members continued to influence pop music, with collaborations with other artists and contributions to hit songs. Gregg Alexander's performance at the inauguration signals a moment of optimism and resilience for many. The song "You Get What You Give" is now considered an American standard, carrying the Presidential seal.

The reunion and performance of New Radicals emphasize a message of hope and the possibility of America 'pulling through' its challenges. The song's lyrics, "You get what you give, you get what you give, so give it away, give it away, give it away now," resonate deeply in today's society, as people come together to overcome the struggles of the pandemic and political divisions.

The performance by New Radicals is a reminder of the power of music to bring people together and inspire hope. As President Biden said in his inaugural address, "We are at our best when we act with empathy, kindness, and compassion." The reunion of New Radicals and their performance of "You Get What You Give" embodies this message, serving as a beacon of hope for a brighter future.

The song's significance to the Biden family is particularly poignant, as it was a source of strength and inspiration for Beau Biden during his battle with cancer. The performance by New Radicals is a tribute to Beau's memory and a reminder of the importance of hope and resilience in the face of adversity.

The reunion of New Radicals and their performance at the Biden-Harris virtual inaugural parade is a moment of joy and celebration in a time of great challenge. The song "You Get What You Give" has become an anthem for hope and optimism, and its performance by the original artists serves as a reminder of the power of music to bring people together and inspire positive change.

In a time of great division and uncertainty, the reunion of New Radicals and their performance of "You Get What You Give" is a beacon of hope and a reminder of the possibility of America 'pulling through' its challenges.
