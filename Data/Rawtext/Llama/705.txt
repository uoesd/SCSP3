Black Friday Gun Sales Reach Record High as Oxford High School Shooting Renews Calls for Stricter Gun Laws

The Oxford High School shooting in Michigan, which left four students dead and seven others injured, has reignited debates over gun safety and laws in the state. The shooting came as the FBI processed a record-breaking 187,585 background checks for gun purchases on Black Friday, with nearly 700,000 firearms bought or attempted to be bought during the sales.

According to the FBI, the 2021 Black Friday ranks among the top 10 highest days for firearm background checks since 1998. The pistol used in the Oxford High School shooting was bought on Black Friday by the suspect's father, highlighting the ease with which individuals can access firearms in the United States.

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, referred to gun violence as a "public health crisis" in a statement following the shooting. "We must do more to protect our communities from the devastating impact of gun violence," she said.

However, not all officials are in favor of stricter gun laws. Meshawn Maddock, co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party, expressed support for armed teachers, stating that "the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."

The Oxford High School shooting is considered the sixth mass shooting in 2021, contrasting with two in 2020. Despite the increasing number of mass shootings, support for stricter gun control has diminished, with only 52% of Americans in favor according to a Gallup poll.

The shooting has sparked renewed calls for stricter gun laws in Michigan, with many arguing that the state's laws are too lax. Michigan is ranked 20th by the Giffords Law Center for states with the strictest gun laws, with laws that allow for the open carry of firearms and do not require background checks for private sales.

Gun control advocates argue that stricter laws, such as universal background checks and red flag laws, could help prevent individuals who pose a risk to themselves or others from accessing firearms. However, opponents of stricter gun laws argue that such measures would infringe upon their Second Amendment rights.

The Oxford High School shooting has highlighted the ongoing debate over gun control in the United States, with both sides dug in and unwilling to compromise. As the number of mass shootings continues to rise, it remains to be seen whether stricter gun laws will be implemented to address the issue.

In the meantime, the families of the victims of the Oxford High School shooting are left to grieve and wonder what could have been done to prevent the tragedy. The shooting serves as a reminder of the devastating impact of gun violence and the need for action to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.

In conclusion, the Oxford High School shooting has reignited debates over gun safety and laws in Michigan, with calls for stricter gun control measures and opposition from those who argue such laws would infringe upon their Second Amendment rights. The shooting serves as a reminder of the ongoing debate over gun control in the United States and the need for action to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.
