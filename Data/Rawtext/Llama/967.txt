Kathy Hochul Becomes New York's First Female Governor, Vows to Change Governance Culture

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) – In a private ceremony overseen by Chief Judge Janet DiFiore, Kathy Hochul was sworn in as the first female governor of New York on Wednesday, taking over the position left vacant by Andrew Cuomo's resignation amid sexual harassment allegations.

Hochul, a former congresswoman and lieutenant governor, becomes the state's 57th governor and the first woman to hold the position. She inherits a state government that has been rocked by scandal and faces numerous challenges, including a resurgence of COVID-19, economic instability, and a housing crisis.

In her inaugural address, Hochul pledged to change the governance culture of the state, which she described as "toxic" and "dysfunctional." She differs from Cuomo on COVID-19 measures, favoring mandatory masks for schoolchildren.

"I want to make it clear that I will not tolerate any form of harassment or discrimination in this administration," Hochul said. "We will have a zero-tolerance policy, and anyone who violates it will be held accountable."

Hochul's ascension to the governorship comes as a majority of New York's powerful state government positions are now held by women. DiFiore, who administered the oath of office, is the first woman to serve as chief judge of the state's highest court.

Cuomo defended his record in a farewell address, dismissing the allegations against him as a "political firecracker." He faces legal issues, including allegations of groping and misleading the public on nursing home deaths.

"I'm proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm proud of the progress we've made," Cuomo said. "I'm not going to let the political firecracker of the moment define my legacy."

Hochul inherits a state government that has been criticized for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in nursing homes. Cuomo's administration has faced allegations of underreporting nursing home deaths and failing to properly investigate complaints of mistreatment.

Assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou, a Democrat from Manhattan, praised Hochul's commitment to addressing the issues facing the state.

"I'm excited to work with Governor Hochul to address the challenges facing our state, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the housing crisis," Niou said. "I'm confident that she will bring a fresh perspective and a commitment to transparency and accountability to the governor's office."

Melissa DeRosa, a top aide to former Governor Cuomo, expressed confidence that Hochul would continue the state's progress on issues such as healthcare and education.

"Governor Hochul has a strong record of public service, and I'm confident that she will continue to move New York forward," DeRosa said.

Jay Jacobs, the state Democratic Party chair, praised Hochul's leadership skills and commitment to diversity and inclusion.

"Governor Hochul is a unifying force who will bring people together to address the challenges facing our state," Jacobs said. "She has a deep commitment to diversity and inclusion, and I'm confident that she will make sure that everyone has a seat at the table."

Hochul has outlined a different governing style than Cuomo, favoring a more collaborative approach. She plans to appoint new aides while reviewing current staff.

"I want to make sure that we have the right people in the right positions, people who share my commitment to transparency, accountability, and diversity and inclusion," Hochul said.

As she takes office, Hochul faces a daunting task in addressing the numerous challenges facing the state. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic instability, the state is also grappling with a housing crisis and ongoing issues with the state's infrastructure.

But with a majority of state government positions now held by women, many are optimistic that Hochul's leadership will bring a fresh perspective and a new era of governance to New York.

"I'm excited to see what Governor Hochul will do," said Niou. "I think she has the potential to be a transformative leader for our state."
