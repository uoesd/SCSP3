FBI Warns of Armed Protests Ahead of Biden's Inauguration, States Activate National Guard

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has issued a warning of possible armed protests in all 50 states and the US capital ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20. State officials are preparing for potentially violent demonstrations in support of President Donald Trump, with National Guard forces being activated in several states including California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Florida.

Wesley Allen Beeler, a 31-year-old man, was arrested at a security checkpoint near the US Capitol with a loaded handgun and over 500 rounds of ammunition. Beeler claimed it was "an honest mistake" and that he was a private security guard who got lost.

The FBI has warned of potential violent protests at all 50 state capitol buildings starting on Saturday and lasting through Biden's inauguration. The anti-government "Boogaloo" movement plans to hold rallies in all 50 states on Sunday.

State officials are taking various security measures, including closing the Texas Capitol and erecting a fence around the Michigan Capitol. Thousands of armed National Guard troops are on the streets of Washington, DC, ahead of the inauguration.

"We are taking any and all threats seriously and are prepared to handle any situation that may arise," said Steve McCraw, Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety.

Michigan State Police Director Joe Gasper stated, "We are working closely with our local, state, and federal partners to ensure the safety of everyone involved."

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker emphasized the importance of safety, saying, "The safety of the public is our top priority, and we will do everything in our power to ensure that everyone can exercise their First Amendment rights peacefully and safely."

Democratic US Representative Don Beyer of Virginia expressed concern about the potential for violence, saying, "The FBI's warning of armed protests is a sobering reminder of the danger posed by extremist groups."

House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff stated, "The American people deserve to know the full extent of the threats we face, and we will do everything in our power to uncover the truth."

House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson added, "We must take all necessary steps to protect our democracy and ensure the safety of our citizens."

House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney emphasized the need for accountability, saying, "We must get to the bottom of what happened on January 6 and ensure that those responsible are held accountable."

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated, "We will not let extremist groups undermine our democracy. We will do everything in our power to protect the rule of law and ensure that justice is served."

The FBI's warning comes after a riot at the US Capitol on January 6, which resulted in the death of a police officer and the injury of several others. Democratic leaders of four US congressional committees have opened a review of the riot.

In conclusion, the FBI's warning of armed protests ahead of Biden's inauguration has put state officials on high alert. With National Guard forces activated in several states and security measures in place, officials are working to ensure the safety of everyone involved. The potential for violence is a sobering reminder of the danger posed by extremist groups, and lawmakers are vowing to take all necessary steps to protect democracy and ensure accountability.
