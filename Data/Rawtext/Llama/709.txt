Staff Member Arrested for Leaving Threatening Notes at Michigan Middle School

ST. CLAIR SHORES, Mich. – A staff member at a Michigan middle school was arrested for leaving threatening notes, including a school threat, prompting an investigation and condemnation from school officials and law enforcement.

According to Lakeview Public Schools Superintendent Karl Paulson, the unnamed staff member was caught on security camera footage leaving the notes in various locations throughout the school. Paulson informed families of the incident in a letter, assuring them that the district takes the situation seriously and is cooperating with police.

One of the notes seemed to be a false threat aimed at closing the school, but no lockdowns or safety protocols were initiated. The incident follows a history of school threats in Michigan, notably after the Oxford High School shooting, and recent nationwide school closures prompted by anonymous shooting and bomb threats on TikTok.

"I am extremely disappointed in the staff member involved," Paulson said in the letter. "The safety and well-being of our students and staff are of the utmost importance, and any actions that compromise that safety will not be tolerated."

Macomb County Prosecutor Peter Lucido suggests there's enough evidence for several charges and questions the staff member's motives. "It's very disturbing that a staff member would engage in this type of behavior, particularly given the current concerns over school safety," Lucido said.

The incident has sparked outrage and concern among parents and community members, who are calling for accountability and stricter measures to prevent such incidents in the future.

"I'm angry and disappointed that a staff member would do something like this," said Sarah Johnson, a parent of two Lakeview students. "I expect better from the people who are supposed to protect and educate my children."

The school district has vowed to take appropriate action and ensure that all staff members are held to the highest standards of conduct. "We will not tolerate any behavior that compromises the safety and well-being of our students and staff," Paulson said.

The investigation is ongoing, and the staff member remains in custody pending charges. Lucido emphasizes the negative impact of the incident, given the current climate of fear and uncertainty surrounding school safety.

"This type of behavior is unacceptable and has a chilling effect on the community," Lucido said. "We will do everything in our power to hold those responsible accountable and ensure that our schools remain safe and secure."

The incident serves as a reminder of the need for vigilance and cooperation between school officials, law enforcement, and the community to prevent threats and ensure the safety of all students and staff.

"We must all work together to prevent incidents like this and ensure that our schools remain safe and welcoming places for everyone," Paulson said.

As the investigation continues, parents and community members are urged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity or threats to school officials or law enforcement.

"We will do everything in our power to ensure the safety and well-being of our students and staff," Paulson said. "We must all work together to prevent incidents like this and ensure that our schools remain safe and welcoming places for everyone."
