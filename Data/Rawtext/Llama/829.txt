Fourth Stimulus Check Uncertain as Lawmakers Debate Relief Options

As the country continues to grapple with the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, lawmakers are debating the possibility of a fourth stimulus payment for Americans. However, approval is uncertain due to opposition from Republicans and some moderate Democrats. Despite this, more federal money may be coming to some Americans in the form of monthly payments through a temporary expansion of the child tax credit starting July 15.

Under the expanded child tax credit, families will receive $250 for each child ages 6 to 17, and $300 for every kid younger than 6 for six months. The remaining amount will be available as refunds in next year's taxes. This expansion is part of the COVID stimulus bill signed by President Joe Biden in March.

In addition to the child tax credit expansion, homeowners struggling with their mortgage payments due to COVID can access a $10 billion homeowner assistance fund, also part of Biden's COVID rescue package. Renters can also receive relief through $46.6 billion in emergency aid from recent pandemic relief bills to help with unpaid rent and utilities.

There is ongoing discussion about another conventional stimulus check, with some proposals calling for $2,000 monthly payments or automatic payments in response to financial triggers. However, the potential for a fourth stimulus check faces challenges, including the perception that the economy may be recovering.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki indicated that Biden is open to the idea of another stimulus check, but he is currently focused on his infrastructure package and families plan. "We're always looking at ways to provide relief to the American people, but our primary focus right now is on passing the President's infrastructure package and families plan," Psaki said.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding a fourth stimulus check, people not eligible for the mentioned checks or aids are encouraged to explore other ways to find financial relief. This may include seeking assistance from local non-profits, community organizations, or government agencies.

In conclusion, while the possibility of a fourth stimulus check remains uncertain, there are still various forms of relief available to Americans struggling financially due to the pandemic. It is important for individuals to stay informed and explore all available options to find the support they need during this challenging time.
