Dakota High School Student Arrested for Allegedly Using 'Dark Web' to Fake Shooting Threat

(WXYZ) – A Dakota High School student is facing serious charges after allegedly using the "dark web" to pay for a fake shooting threat at the school. The Macomb County Sheriff's Office responded to the false report of an "active shooter incident" at Dakota High School on April 19, treating the incident with high priority to ensure the safety of students and staff.

According to Macomb County Sheriff Anthony Wickersham, two hoax calls were made to dispatchers, one posing as a victim and another as a staff member reporting a shooter. "We take every call seriously, and we respond with the same level of urgency to ensure the safety of everyone involved," Sheriff Wickersham said.

Despite the swift response, no evidence of an actual shooting was found at the scene. The investigation led authorities to a juvenile student, who is now facing a count of False Threat of Terrorism. The student had allegedly arranged for the false threats through a contact made on the "dark web."

School Superintendent Ron Roberts emphasized the importance of taking every threat seriously and the potential consequences. "The safety and security of our students and staff are our top priority, and we will not tolerate any actions that compromise that safety," Roberts said.

The ongoing investigation seeks to address and mitigate such threats to maintain the safety and security of students and staff. Sheriff Wickersham reiterated the seriousness with which "swatting" calls are taken, emphasizing that they can put people's lives in danger and waste valuable resources.

The incident serves as a reminder of the potential dangers of the "dark web" and the importance of being vigilant in reporting any suspicious activity. The Macomb County Sheriff's Office is working closely with the Chippewa Valley Schools to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to prevent such incidents in the future.

In conclusion, the fake shooting threat at Dakota High School highlights the importance of taking every threat seriously and the potential consequences of such actions. The Macomb County Sheriff's Office and Chippewa Valley Schools are committed to maintaining a safe and secure environment for all students and staff.
