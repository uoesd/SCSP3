Egypt Seeks Over $1 Billion in Compensation for Clearing Ever Given from Suez Canal

CAIRO – Egyptian authorities are seeking over $1 billion in compensation for the costs incurred in clearing the Ever Given, a 200,000 ton mega-container carrier, from the Suez Canal, according to Osama Rabie, Chairman and Managing Director of the Suez Canal Authority.

Rabie cited losses in canal revenue, equipment costs, and manpower as reasons for the high compensation figure. "We have incurred significant costs in dealing with the aftermath of the Ever Given's grounding," Rabie said in a statement. "We hope to reach a compensation agreement soon, but we cannot specify who might be liable to pay at this time."

The Ever Given was refloated six days after becoming stuck, causing a major disruption in international shipping. The incident held up $9 billion in global trade per day and left 422 vessels waiting to pass through the Suez Canal.

First-hand accounts from rescue workers highlighted the dangers and challenges faced in freeing the ship. "It was a race against time," said Aly Awamy, a mechanic on the Mashhour Dredger, which was involved in the rescue efforts. "We had to work around the clock to clear the ship before the next high tide."

Mohammed Sayed, Head Dredger on the Mashhour Dredger, described the operation as "extremely complex." "We had to carefully assess the situation and come up with a plan to free the ship without causing further damage," he said.

Youssef Naghi, a dredger who also worked on the rescue efforts, praised the teamwork and coordination of the rescue teams. "It was a huge challenge, but we worked together to get the job done," he said.

An investigation into the incident is underway, examining potential human and technical errors. The complex ownership and management structure of the Ever Given adds to the challenge of determining responsibility.

Insurance industry losses are estimated to be in the low hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Brian Schneider, Senior Director of the Insurance division of Fitch Ratings. "The incident has had a significant impact on the insurance industry, but it's still early days in terms of assessing the full extent of the losses," Schneider said.

The ship's operator, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, and owner, Shoei Kisen, are in discussions about compensation but have not provided specifics. A spokesperson for Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement said, "We are working closely with the Suez Canal Authority and other parties involved to resolve the situation as quickly and fairly as possible."

The incident has highlighted the importance of the Suez Canal as a vital artery of global trade and the potential consequences of disruptions to the waterway. "We are committed to ensuring the safety and efficiency of the Suez Canal, and we will continue to work with all parties involved to prevent such incidents in the future," Rabie said.
