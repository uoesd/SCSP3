Stimulus Checks Start Rolling Out to Millions of Seniors

Washington, D.C. - The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has begun processing stimulus payments for millions of seniors who did not file a 2019 or 2020 tax return. The payments, which are part of the third round of stimulus checks, are being made to eligible seniors receiving Social Security retirement benefits, SSDI, SSI, or RRB benefits.

According to the IRS, the agency received data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) in late March, allowing them to begin processing payments for approximately 30 million seniors. The payments are being made in the same way recipients receive their regular Social Security benefits, mostly electronically.

In addition to seniors receiving Social Security benefits, veterans receiving benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs who did not file a recent tax return will also receive stimulus payments soon.

The IRS emphasizes that most beneficiaries do not need to take any action to receive their stimulus payment. However, some beneficiaries may need to file a 2020 tax return to claim additional funds for a spouse or dependents.

Eligible Americans will receive a $1,400 base amount, with $2,800 for married couples and an extra $1,400 for each dependent. However, the payments will be phased out for individuals with higher adjusted gross incomes.

The deadline for filing a 2020 tax return has been extended to May 17, 2021, giving individuals who have not yet filed their taxes additional time to do so.

The third round of stimulus checks is part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed into law in March 2020. The act aimed to provide financial assistance to Americans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In conclusion, millions of seniors who did not file a 2019 or 2020 tax return have started receiving their third stimulus checks. The IRS is urging eligible individuals to file their taxes as soon as possible to ensure they receive their full payment. For more information, visit the IRS website or consult a tax professional.
