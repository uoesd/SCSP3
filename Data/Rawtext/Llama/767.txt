Hollywood's Gun Debate Rages On: Real Firearms vs. Visual Effects

In the wake of the tragic fatal shooting on the set of "Rust" by Alec Baldwin, which resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, the long-standing debate over the use of real firearms on film and TV sets has reignited. The incident has sparked a renewed call for stricter safety protocols and a reevaluation of the need for real firearms in production.

Leslie Grossman, an actor from "American Horror Story," has joined the conversation, revealing that she mostly used rubber or air guns for shooting scenes. "I've never been a fan of using real guns on set," Grossman said in a recent interview. "There's just no need for it. With the advancements in visual effects technology, we can easily create the illusion of a real gun without putting anyone in harm's way."

The "Rust" incident has prompted several shows to reconsider their use of real firearms. "The Rookie" and "The Boys" are among the productions that have banned real firearms from their sets. "We take the safety of our cast and crew very seriously," said Eric Kripke, showrunner of "The Boys." "In light of recent events, we have decided to err on the side of caution and eliminate the use of real firearms from our production."

A petition to ban real guns from film and TV sets, started by filmmaker Bandar Albuliwi and gun control activist Cameron Kasky, has garnered nearly 70,000 signatures. "The use of real firearms on set is a recipe for disaster," Albuliwi said. "It's only a matter of time before we see another tragedy like the one on 'Rust.' We need to take action now to prevent further harm."

California state senator Dave Cortese and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham have both advocated for legislation banning real firearms and live ammo on sets. "The safety of our film industry workers is of the utmost importance," Cortese said. "We need to ensure that they are able to work in a safe and controlled environment, without the risk of harm from real firearms."

Grisham added, "We have a responsibility to protect the people who work in our state's film industry. Banning real firearms and live ammo on sets is a common-sense measure that will help prevent tragedies like the one on 'Rust' from happening in the future."

Filmmaker Bandar Albuliwi and Parkland shooting survivor Cameron Kasky have both questioned the film industry's safety standards, particularly outside of Los Angeles. "The use of real firearms on set is not only dangerous, but it's also unnecessary," Kasky said. "With the advancements in visual effects technology, we can create gun effects like muzzle flashes in post-production. There's no need to risk lives for the sake of authenticity."

Albuliwi added, "The film industry has a culture that often silences safety concerns. We need to change that culture and prioritize safety above all else. No story is worth risking lives."

Leslie Grossman echoed these sentiments, stressing the importance of speaking up when safety concerns arise. "I think it's important for all of us in the industry to speak up when we see something that doesn't feel right," Grossman said. "We need to create a culture where safety is everyone's top priority, and where we can all feel safe and supported on set."

In the wake of the "Rust" tragedy, it's clear that the debate over real firearms on film and TV sets is far from over. As the industry continues to grapple with this issue, one thing is certain: the safety of cast and crew must always come first.
