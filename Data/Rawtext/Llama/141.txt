"Cuomo Prime Time" Hits Rock Bottom: Lowest-Rated Week of the Year Amid Brother's Scandals

In a week that saw multiple scandals engulfing New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, his brother Chris Cuomo's CNN show, "Cuomo Prime Time," suffered its lowest-rated week of the year, averaging a paltry 1.2 million viewers from April 5 to April 9. The show's viewership has plummeted by 45 percent compared to the week of January 25, according to Nielsen Media Research.

The precipitous drop in viewership coincides with the mounting scandals surrounding Governor Cuomo, who has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women and covering up nursing home COVID-19 deaths. Chris Cuomo, a CNN anchor and host of "Cuomo Prime Time," has also faced criticism for his involvement in his brother's administration, including reportedly receiving prioritized coronavirus testing.

CNN's decision to allow Chris Cuomo to interview his brother in a series of widely criticized segments has backfired, with many accusing the network of lacking seriousness and journalistic integrity. In response to the backlash, CNN announced that Chris Cuomo would no longer cover his brother on the show.

The damage, however, has already been done. "Cuomo Prime Time" saw a staggering 55 percent decline in viewership among adults age 25-54, a demographic highly sought after by advertisers. The show's dismal performance has left it lagging behind other cable news programs, including Fox News' "Gutfeld!," which has outperformed every CNN program since its premiere on April 5.

In fact, "Gutfeld!" has not only bested "Cuomo Prime Time" but also surpassed several broadcast network late-night shows in viewership. The Fox News program, hosted by Greg Gutfeld, has capitalized on the vacuum left by the struggling CNN show, attracting a larger audience with its irreverent humor and biting commentary.

The contrast between the two shows is stark. While "Cuomo Prime Time" has struggled to maintain its audience, "Gutfeld!" has thrived, offering a fresh and engaging take on current events. The success of "Gutfeld!" has solidified Fox News' position as a leader in cable news, while CNN's woes continue to mount.

The ratings disaster for "Cuomo Prime Time" has raised questions about the future of the show and Chris Cuomo's role at CNN. As the scandals surrounding Governor Cuomo continue to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the show can recover from its precipitous decline in viewership.

In the meantime, Fox News' "Gutfeld!" has established itself as a force to be reckoned with, offering a unique and entertaining perspective on current events that has resonated with audiences. As the late-night landscape continues to evolve, "Gutfeld!" has cemented its place as a leader in the genre.

The struggles of "Cuomo Prime Time" serve as a reminder of the importance of maintaining journalistic integrity and avoiding conflicts of interest. As the media landscape continues to shift, it is clear that audiences demand transparency and accountability from their news sources.

In the end, the ratings tell the story. "Cuomo Prime Time" has faltered, while "Gutfeld!" has flourished. The contrast between the two shows is a testament to the power of quality programming and the importance of maintaining a strong connection with audiences.
