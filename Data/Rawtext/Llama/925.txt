MFA Highlights Racial Inequity in COVID-19's Impact through Powerful Posters

The Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) in Boston is using public art to bring attention to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on minority communities. As part of Carrie Mae Weems's "RESIST COVID/ TAKE 6" project, the MFA is featuring posters that aim to raise awareness about racial inequity and the pandemic's toll.

One of the posters on display features a black-and-white photo of a Black man, which, according to Kristen Gresh, the MFA's senior photography curator, is meant to emphasize the dual message of systemic violence and COVID-19's disproportionate effects. "The poster is a powerful reminder of the ways in which systemic racism and violence continue to affect communities of color, and how the pandemic has exacerbated these issues," Gresh said.

The RESIST posters, fliers, and digital banners are not limited to the MFA's walls, however. They are displayed across various public spaces in Boston and other major cities, making it a global movement, according to Edward Saywell, chair of the MFA's Prints and Drawings department. "We are proud to be a part of this global movement, using public art to bring attention to the issues that matter most," Saywell said.

Weems approached the MFA with the campaign in December, after starting work on it during the early lockdowns. The campaign includes multiple messages, emphasizing systemic racism, violence, the importance of vaccination, and gratitude towards frontline workers. "I wanted to use my platform as an artist to bring attention to the ways in which COVID-19 is affecting communities of color, and to encourage people to take action," Weems said.

In addition to the poster highlighting racial inequity, another poster promotes vaccination as the best defense against the virus. According to Gresh, the campaign aligns with the MFA's commitment to public art forms accessible from the street. "We believe that public art has the power to bring people together and spark important conversations, and this campaign is a perfect example of that," Gresh said.

The project also promotes collaboration and public art's role in community connection and dialogue. "We are thrilled to be working with Carrie Mae Weems on this project, and to be a part of a global movement using art to bring attention to important social issues," Saywell said.

The MFA's participation in the RESIST COVID/ TAKE 6 project is just one example of the museum's commitment to using art to address pressing social issues. "We believe that art has the power to inspire and educate, and that it can play a critical role in shaping our understanding of the world around us," Gresh said.

The RESIST COVID/ TAKE 6 project is a powerful reminder of the ways in which art can be used to bring attention to important social issues and to promote dialogue and change. As the pandemic continues to affect communities around the world, projects like this one are more important than ever.

In conclusion, the MFA's participation in the RESIST COVID/ TAKE 6 project is a powerful example of the role that public art can play in bringing attention to important social issues. Through the use of posters, fliers, and digital banners, the project aims to raise awareness about racial inequity and the pandemic's toll, and to promote vaccination and gratitude towards frontline workers. As a global movement, it is a testament to the power of art to inspire and educate, and to shape our understanding of the world around us.
