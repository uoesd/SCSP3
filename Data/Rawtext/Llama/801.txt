U.S. Consumer Spending Surges 4.2% in March on Government Relief, Income Jumps

WASHINGTON, April 30 – U.S. consumer spending rebounded strongly in March, rising 4.2% amid a surge in income due to government COVID-19 pandemic relief money, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Friday.

"The consumer is back, and they're back in a big way," said Brendan Coughlin, head of consumer banking at Citizens in Boston. "The stimulus checks and improved public health conditions have given people the confidence to open up their wallets and pursue the things they've been putting off for the past year."

Personal income also saw a significant boost, rising 21.1% in March, thanks in part to one-time $1,400 stimulus checks. This led to a saving rate soar to 27.6%, indicating that consumers have been able to save more during the pandemic.

"The government's expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination program and fiscal generosity are lifting consumer spirits," said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina. "We expect consumer spending to further accelerate in the second quarter as more people feel comfortable venturing out and spending their money."

The Employment Cost Index saw a significant jump, indicating rising wages and potential labor market tightness. Wage increases are expected to sustain consumer spending even as the stimulus effect fades.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that inflation is warming up, with the core PCE price index increasing 1.8% in the 12 months through March. However, he emphasized that the central bank will remain vigilant in monitoring price pressures.

Economists expect robust consumer spending and economic growth, with projections for growth of at least 7% in 2021. The surge in consumer spending and income suggests that the U.S. economy is poised for a strong rebound in the second quarter.

"We're seeing a release of pent-up demand as consumers become more confident in their financial prospects," said Coughlin. "This bodes well for the overall health of the economy and suggests that we're on track for a sustained period of growth."

The significant fiscal stimulus of $1.9 trillion from the White House and rapidly improving public health conditions have helped to boost consumer spending, which accounts for a major part of U.S. economic activity.

"The stars are aligning for a strong economic rebound," said House. "We expect consumer spending to continue to drive growth in the coming months, supported by rising wages and increased confidence."

In conclusion, the rebound in consumer spending in March suggests that the U.S. economy is poised for a strong recovery in the second quarter. With rising incomes, increased wage growth, and improving public health conditions, consumers are feeling more confident in their financial prospects and are ready to open up their wallets and pursue the things they've been putting off for the past year.
