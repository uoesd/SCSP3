Facebook Cracks Down on Israeli Cyber Intelligence Firm for Surveillance-for-Hire Operations

In a major crackdown on the global surveillance-for-hire industry, Facebook has banned Israeli cyber intelligence firm Cognyte and related accounts for targeting journalists and politicians via social media. Cognyte's CEO, Elad Sharon, had recently celebrated the company's first trading day on Nasdaq, boasting of its sizable annual revenues, global workforce, and diverse client base, including the U.S. Department of Justice.

Facebook's six-month investigation identified six firms and one unnamed Chinese entity involved in the global surveillance-for-hire industry, mostly based in Israel. The targeted entities utilized social media to gather intelligence, often by establishing fake accounts and manipulating targets to compromise their devices. Approximately 1,500 accounts linked to these operations were taken down, and around 50,000 people in 100 countries were notified of being targeted.

Nathaniel Gleicher, Head of Security Policy at Facebook, stated that the company's investigation also named Cobwebs Technologies, Black Cube, and Bluehawk CI (all Israeli firms), BellTroX (India), and Cytrox (North Macedonia) as part of the industry. An unspecified Chinese entity was involved in surveilling minority groups in China's Xingjian region, employing advanced techniques like facial-recognition software. Bill Marczak, Security Researcher at Citizen Lab, highlighted the pervasive risks of mercenary spyware in political repression, complementing Facebook's actions with the Citizen Lab's report on Cytrox's Predator spyware. Black Cube, however, maintained that it does not engage in hacking or phishing, emphasizing its compliance with local laws in its operations.

The report underlines the misuse of surveillance tools by repressive regimes to target dissenters and vulnerable individuals under the guise of combating crime or terrorism. Facebook's crackdown on Cognyte and related accounts sends a strong message against the abuse of social media for surveillance-for-hire operations.
