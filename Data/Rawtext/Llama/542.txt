Taliban Blames US for Kabul Airport Attack, Promises Amnesty for Foreign Nationals

The Taliban has accused the United States of being responsible for the deadly attack on Kabul's airport on August 27, which marked the deadliest day for the US military in Afghanistan since 2011. The Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, ISIS-K, has already claimed responsibility for the attack.

In a statement, Taliban spokesperson Bilal Karimi criticized the US evacuation strategy, stating that the attack was a result of poor planning by the US. "The Americans are responsible for the attack on the airport, and they should take responsibility for it," he said.

Despite the blame, the Taliban has promised amnesty for foreign nationals who have been living in Afghanistan. "We forgive foreign nationals and encourage knowledgeable individuals to contribute to Afghanistan's prosperity," Karimi said. He also assured that foreign nationals would be allowed to leave the country legally once the situation normalizes.

The Taliban has historically been known for its restrictions on women's rights, but Karimi claimed that the group now supports equal rights for women to study and work, provided they comply with Islamic law. "Women have the right to education and work, but they must adhere to Islamic dress codes to prevent provoking men," he said.

However, across Afghanistan, women have been protesting against the Taliban's conservative laws, facing militant crackdowns. The Taliban's rapid takeover of Afghanistan followed the withdrawal of US and Western troops, ending over two decades of military presence.

Despite the Taliban's blame, ISIS-K has already claimed responsibility for the deadly attack at Kabul airport. The attack killed at least 170 people, including 13 US service members, and injured many more.

The Taliban's statement comes as the group continues to consolidate its power in Afghanistan. The group has been working to establish a new government, with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a co-founder of the Taliban, named as the leader of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

The US has not yet responded to the Taliban's accusations. The attack on Kabul airport has raised concerns about the safety of those still in Afghanistan, including US citizens and Afghan allies who are trying to leave the country.

The situation in Afghanistan remains tense, with the Taliban facing opposition from various groups, including the Northern Alliance, which has vowed to resist the Taliban's rule. The international community is also closely watching the situation, with many countries calling for a peaceful transition and the protection of human rights.

In conclusion, the Taliban's blame on the US for the Kabul airport attack has added to the tensions between the two countries. The situation in Afghanistan remains uncertain, with the Taliban's rule facing opposition from various groups and the international community calling for a peaceful transition and the protection of human rights.
