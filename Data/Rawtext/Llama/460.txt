Prince Philip's Disappointment and Understanding of Prince Harry's Decision

Prince Philip, the late Duke of Edinburgh, was reportedly disappointed by his grandson Prince Harry's decision to step back from royal duties, but he understood the younger royal's frustrations with the media. According to Gyles Brandreth, a biographer of the royal family, Philip believed that Harry's decision was "a great shame," but he also acknowledged that the constant scrutiny of the press can be overwhelming.

Philip strongly disapproved of Harry and his wife Meghan's interview with Oprah Winfrey, calling it "madness." The interview, which aired while Philip was hospitalized, sparked controversy within the royal family and raised concerns about the couple's public airing of personal grievances.

Despite his disapproval of the interview, Philip was not upset that it aired while he was hospitalized. According to sources close to the royal family, Philip was more concerned about the couple's decision to step back from their royal duties and pursue independent careers.

Philip believed in the importance of not focusing on oneself and advised his family against seeking popularity. He was proud of Harry's military service and his appointment as Captain General of the Royal Marines, and he believed that Harry had a valuable role to play within the royal family.

The decision for Harry and Meghan to step back from senior royal duties was agreed upon by the queen, Charles, and William, due to their desire for independent careers and philanthropy. The interview with Oprah aired grievances against the royal family, including accusations of racism and neglect.

Harry returned to the U.K. for Philip's funeral without Meghan, who is pregnant and remained in California. The upcoming funeral service for Philip at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, will spotlight Harry's interactions with the royal family.

Observers are curious about the potential for reconciliation between Harry and the royal family, especially with his brother William. The funeral service may provide an opportunity for the brothers to reconnect and mend their relationship.

The royal family has been through a difficult period, with tensions rising after Harry and Meghan's decision to step back from their royal duties. The interview with Oprah further strained relations, but the funeral service may offer a chance for the family to come together and find common ground.

As the royal family gathers to pay their respects to Prince Philip, the focus will be on Harry's interactions with his family and whether there are any signs of reconciliation. The funeral service will be a somber occasion, but it may also provide an opportunity for the royal family to begin healing and moving forward.

In conclusion, Prince Philip's passing has brought the royal family together in a time of grief and reflection. The funeral service will be a moment for the family to honor Philip's memory and potentially begin the process of healing and reconciliation. While the road ahead may be challenging, the royal family has shown its resilience and ability to adapt to changing times.
