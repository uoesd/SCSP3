Stimulus Checks for Prisoners: A Bipartisan History

In a recent controversy, Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) proposed an amendment to prevent prisoners from receiving $1,400 stimulus checks. The amendment failed on a party-line vote, with Democrats opposing it. Cotton criticized the decision, arguing that prisoners haven't lost jobs due to the pandemic and thus shouldn't need stimulus money. However, Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) countered that blocking stimulus checks to prisoners would disproportionately harm children and communities of color.

It's worth noting that both Democrats and Republicans have supported stimulus bills that sent checks to prisoners in the past. In fact, previous stimulus checks during the Trump administration were also available to prisoners. The eligibility criteria for stimulus payments are broad, requiring citizenship or legal residency and either a tax return filing or completion of an IRS form.

Cotton's press secretary, James Arnold, claimed that the issue with prisoners receiving checks in the CARES Act was "unanticipated" and couldn't be amended in December's bill. However, Republicans had opportunities to address the issue of stimulus payments to prisoners in past legislation but did not.

Senator Cotton said in a statement, "It's unfortunate that Democrats are more interested in helping prisoners than they are in helping law-abiding citizens who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic." However, Senator Durbin argued that the stimulus checks are designed to help those who are struggling financially, regardless of their criminal history. "We're not talking about giving prisoners a handout," Durbin said. "We're talking about helping people who are struggling to make ends meet, and that includes people who are incarcerated."

The claim that Democrats voted to give stimulus checks to prisoners is rated as "Mostly True," acknowledging that Republicans also supported such measures in the past. While it's true that Democrats opposed the amendment to bar prisoners from receiving stimulus checks, it's also true that Republicans have historically supported stimulus bills that sent checks to prisoners.

In a statement, Senator Cassidy said, "We should be targeting relief to those who are truly in need, not criminals who have been convicted of serious crimes." However, it's worth noting that the eligibility criteria for stimulus payments are not limited to those who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic. The criteria are designed to be broad and inclusive, to help as many people as possible who are struggling financially.

Senator Durbin further emphasized that the issue of stimulus payments to prisoners is not a partisan one. "This isn't a Republican or Democratic issue," Durbin said. "It's an issue of fairness and compassion. We should be helping those who are struggling, regardless of their criminal history."

In conclusion, while the controversy over stimulus checks for prisoners may seem like a partisan issue, it's important to remember that both Democrats and Republicans have supported stimulus bills that sent checks to prisoners in the past. The eligibility criteria for stimulus payments are broad and inclusive, designed to help as many people as possible who are struggling financially. The claim that Democrats voted to give stimulus checks to prisoners is rated as "Mostly True," acknowledging that Republicans also supported such measures in the past. Ultimately, the issue of stimulus payments to prisoners is one of fairness and compassion, and it's important for lawmakers to consider the impact of their decisions on all Americans, including those who are incarcerated.
