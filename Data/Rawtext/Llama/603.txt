Vice President Kamala Harris Makes a Sweet Stop in Chicago

Vice President Kamala Harris made a sweet stop in Chicago on her way from California to Washington, D.C. yesterday, visiting the beloved Brown Sugar Bakery in the city's North Side.

Harris, who has been known to have a sweet tooth, ordered a slice of German chocolate cake, citing it as her favorite, and received trays of cupcakes for her return trip. The bakery's owner, Stephanie Hart, was thrilled to have the Vice President visit her establishment.

"It was an honor to have Vice President Harris visit Brown Sugar Bakery," Hart said in a statement. "We're proud to be a part of this community and to have the opportunity to share our southern-style desserts with her."

Brown Sugar Bakery, founded by Hart in 2004, has become a staple in the Chicago community, celebrated for its delicious southern-style desserts. The bakery's caramel cake, in particular, has gained a reputation for being one of the best in the city, with Hart having learned the recipe from an elderly lady in Arkansas.

Despite the challenges faced by small businesses during the pandemic, Brown Sugar Bakery has continued to thrive, thanks in part to the strong support from the community. The bakery has received numerous grants, including a $500,000 state grant that allowed Hart to expand her business by purchasing the Cupid Candies factory.

The community's support for the bakery was highlighted by a $10,000 grant from the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which was featured on 'Good Morning America'. Customers have also shown their dedication by waiting in line outside the bakery, even in cold weather, to get a taste of their favorite desserts.

The bakery's popularity has not only been limited to the local community, as it also ships its delicious treats nationwide. The Vice President's visit and choice of the bakery for dessert was described as a 'sweet call' by Hart, who was grateful for the opportunity to showcase her bakery's offerings to a national audience.

Hart's dedication to her craft and commitment to the community have paid off, as Brown Sugar Bakery has become a beloved institution in Chicago. The bakery's success is a testament to the power of small businesses and the importance of community support.

In a time when many small businesses are struggling to stay afloat, Brown Sugar Bakery's success is a beacon of hope. The bakery's commitment to quality and customer satisfaction, combined with the community's unwavering support, has allowed it to thrive even in the face of adversity.

As the pandemic continues to affect small businesses across the country, the story of Brown Sugar Bakery serves as a reminder of the importance of supporting local establishments. The bakery's success is a testament to what can be achieved when a community comes together to support its local businesses.

In conclusion, Vice President Kamala Harris's visit to Brown Sugar Bakery highlights the importance of small businesses and community support.
