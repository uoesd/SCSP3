Remington Arms Subpoenas Academic Records of Slain Sandy Hook Students

In a controversial move, lawyers for Remington Arms, the manufacturer of the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, have subpoenaed academic records for five of the slain students. The subpoena was issued in response to a lawsuit filed by nine families of the victims, who are suing Remington for wrongful death, alleging that the company recklessly marketed the Bushmaster to civilians.

Attorneys for the families have asked the court to seal the students' confidential records, arguing that they are irrelevant to the case and an invasion of privacy. "It's unconscionable that Remington would seek to violate the privacy of these families who have already suffered so much," said Joshua Koskoff, the lead attorney for the families.

In addition to the academic records, Remington has also subpoenaed employment files for educators involved in the case. The company has not commented publicly on the subpoenas or the lawsuit.

The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 resulted in the deaths of 26 people, including 20 children and six educators. The shooting was carried out by Adam Lanza, who used the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle that he had obtained from his mother's home.

Remington has faced legal challenges in the past, including a lawsuit filed by the families of the victims in 2015. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018 and again the following year, citing financial struggles.

Despite the legal challenges, Remington has continued to manufacture and sell firearms, including the Bushmaster AR-15. In July, the company offered a $33 million settlement to the families, but they have not responded yet.

The subpoenaing of academic records has sparked outrage among the families and their supporters, who argue that it is a violation of their privacy and an attempt to shift the blame away from Remington's role in the tragedy. "Remington's actions are a clear attempt to avoid accountability for their role in the Sandy Hook tragedy," said Koskoff. "We will continue to fight for justice for our clients and to ensure that Remington is held responsible for their actions."

The case is ongoing, with the next court date set for later this year. The families and their attorneys are hopeful that the court will rule in their favor and hold Remington accountable for their role in the Sandy Hook tragedy.
