Lawsuit Seeks $100 Million in Damages Against Oxford School District Over Shooting

Dec 9 (Reuters) – A lawsuit seeking $100 million in damages was filed against the Oxford Community School District and its officials on Tuesday, accusing them of failing to act on prior knowledge of the shooter's threatening behavior before a shooting at Oxford High School that resulted in the death of four students and injury of seven others, including a teacher.

The lawsuit, filed by Michigan personal injury attorney Geoffrey Fieger, represents Riley Franz, 17, who was injured in the shooting, and her sister Bella, 14. It alleges that the school district's superintendent, principal, and other staff knew about the shooter's disturbing online activity but failed to properly respond to his threats of violence and ammunition search.

"This tragedy was entirely preventable," Fieger said in a statement. "The school district and its officials had a responsibility to protect the students in their care, and they failed miserably. We will hold them accountable for their inaction."

The shooter, 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, is accused of carrying out the shooting on November 30. His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, are also facing charges of involuntary manslaughter for providing him with a gun and ignoring warning signs.

The lawsuit accuses the school district of assuring parents and students of safety despite knowing of the shooter's threatening behavior. It also criticizes the school staff's failure to properly respond to Crumbley's threats of violence and ammunition search.

"The school district's failure to act on this information was a direct cause of the tragic events that unfolded on November 30," Fieger said. "The victims and their families deserve justice, and we will fight tirelessly to ensure that they receive it."

The lawsuit is seeking $100 million in damages for the victims and their families. The district has not responded to the lawsuit.

The shooting at Oxford High School has sparked outrage and calls for action to prevent such tragedies in the future. The lawsuit filed by Fieger is the first step in holding the school district and its officials accountable for their role in the shooting.

The lawsuit emphasizes that the shooting was preventable and criticizes the school's reassurances of safety. It alleges that the school district's failure to act on prior knowledge of the shooter's threatening behavior was a direct cause of the tragic events that unfolded on November 30.
