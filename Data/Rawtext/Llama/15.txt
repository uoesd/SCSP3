Purple Reigns Supreme: The Inauguration's Symbolic Color Choice

The inauguration of President Joseph R. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris was a momentous occasion, marked by a sea of purple that flooded the Capitol. The color, worn by prominent figures such as Dr. Jill Biden, Kamala Harris, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, Amy Klobuchar, and Mike Pence, was not just a fashion statement, but a symbol of unity, royalty, and social values.

According to Gwendolyn Dubois Shaw, Senior Historian at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, purple has deep-rooted significance in American democracy and royalty. "Purple is associated with royalty, and it's a way of signaling that the president and vice president are our own form of royalty," she said. The color's association with the Purple Heart, which honors military personnel wounded or killed in service, adds another layer of meaning to its use at the inauguration.

The choice of purple also represents a call for bipartisan harmony, blending red (Republican) and blue (Democratic) into a symbol of unity. This message of unity is particularly significant in light of recent political division and conflict. As Shaw notes, "The use of purple at the inauguration sends a message that we're all in this together, and that we need to work together to move forward."

The historic nature of Harris's inauguration as the first African American woman to hold the office of Vice President is also reflected in the choice of purple. Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel 'The Color Purple', which explores the struggles of African American women, adds another layer of significance to the color's use.

In contrast to the red hats that symbolized the previous administration, the purple theme of the inauguration represents a call for change and a rejection of divisive politics. As Shaw notes, "The use of purple is a way of signaling that we're moving away from the conflict and division of the past four years, and towards a more united and harmonious future."

In conclusion, the color purple featured prominently at the inauguration of President Joseph R. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, symbolizing unity, royalty, and social values. The choice of purple sends a powerful message beyond fashion, reflecting a desire for bipartisan harmony and a rejection of recent political division. As the nation looks towards a brighter future, the significance of purple at the inauguration serves as a reminder of the power of unity and the importance of working together towards a common goal.
