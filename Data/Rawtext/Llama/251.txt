Biden Signs $1.9 Trillion Covid-19 Relief Package into Law

CNN – President Joe Biden signed a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 economic relief package into law on Thursday, marking a major milestone in his administration's efforts to combat the pandemic and support struggling Americans.

"This legislation is a critical step in rebuilding the backbone of our country and supporting working and middle-class families who have been hit hardest by this crisis," Biden said in a statement.

The signing of the relief package, which was Biden's top legislative priority since taking office in January, was moved up a day earlier than planned. A celebration with Congressional leaders will follow.

The plan includes a number of provisions aimed at providing immediate relief to Americans, including $1,400 stimulus payments for most households, a $300 boost to weekly jobless benefits, and an expanded child tax credit. It also allocates $350 billion for state and local aid, funds for K-12 schools, small businesses, and Covid-19 vaccine distribution.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced that stimulus checks could start appearing in bank accounts as early as the coming weekend.

Biden is set to deliver his first prime-time address on Thursday evening, marking the one-year anniversary of the Covid-19 pandemic shutdown. The address will acknowledge the pandemic's impact and outline steps to combat the virus, offering a hopeful vision for the future.

"We're going to get through this, and we're going to come out stronger on the other side," Biden said in a preview of his address.

The relief package provides $14 billion for Covid-19 vaccine research, distribution, and administration efforts.

Ron Klain, White House Chief of Staff, praised the package as a "critical step forward" in the fight against the pandemic.

"This legislation will help us contain the virus, support our heroic healthcare workers, and get our economy back on track," Klain said in a statement.

The signing of the relief package comes as the US continues to grapple with the ongoing pandemic. According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US has recorded over 29 million cases of Covid-19 and over 530,000 deaths.

Despite the challenges ahead, Biden expressed optimism about the future, saying that the relief package represents a "down payment" on a brighter future for America.

"We're going to get through this, and we're going to come out stronger on the other side," Biden said.

The relief package passed the House of Representatives last week with a vote of 219-212, with no Republicans voting in favor. It passed the Senate earlier this week with a vote of 50-49, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote.

The signing of the relief package marks a significant victory for Biden and his administration, who have made addressing the pandemic and supporting struggling Americans a top priority.

In a statement, Psaki praised the package as a "significant step forward" in the fight against the pandemic.

"This legislation will help us support working and middle-class families, get our economy back on track, and ultimately defeat the virus," Psaki said.

As the US continues to battle the pandemic, the relief package provides a much-needed boost to efforts to contain the virus and support those affected. With the signing of this legislation, Biden and his administration are taking a critical step forward in their efforts to address the crisis and build a stronger, more resilient America.
