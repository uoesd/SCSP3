Protesters Take to the Streets of Milwaukee After Kyle Rittenhouse Acquittal

More than 100 marchers took to the streets of Milwaukee on Saturday to protest the not guilty verdict of Kyle Rittenhouse, who killed two and wounded one during Kenosha protests in 2020. The protest was in response to Rittenhouse's acquittal for the shootings during the unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake.

Mariah Smith of the Peoples Revolution emphasized the verdict's impact on white allies in the Black liberation movement. "This verdict is a slap in the face to all those who claim to be allies to the Black community," she said. "It's time for them to put their money where their mouth is and take action to dismantle the systemic racism that allows for these kinds of tragedies to occur."

The Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression sponsored the march, which ended at the Federal Courthouse where speeches were given. Protesters chanted slogans like "No Justice No Peace No Racist Police" and "Black Lives Matter."

Omar Flores, co-chair of the alliance, stressed the importance of organized action for civilian control of the police. "We can't just rely on the courts to bring about justice," he said. "We need to take to the streets and demand change from our elected officials."

Retired minister Dale Stohre expressed grief over the verdict and its implications for all involved, including the town of Kenosha. "My heart goes out to the families of those who were killed and injured," he said. "But this verdict also has a broader impact on our community and our society as a whole. It's a reminder that we have a long way to go in terms of addressing systemic racism and police brutality."

Milwaukee resident Nathaniel Haack pointed out the chilling effect of the verdict on the right to protest peacefully. "The message this verdict sends is that it's okay for police to use deadly force against protesters," he said. "That's a dangerous precedent that undermines our fundamental right to free speech and assembly."

Kenosha resident Adelana Akindes criticized the portrayal of protesters as rioters and looters by the judge overseeing Rittenhouse's case. "The media and the authorities have been trying to paint us as violent and dangerous, but that's not what this movement is about," she said. "We're fighting for justice and equality, and we won't be silenced by this verdict."

Participants viewed the verdict as a setback for racial justice and the safety of protestors. "This verdict is a step backward for our community," said one protester. "But we won't let it discourage us. We'll keep fighting for a world where everyone is treated with dignity and respect."

The march and rally were peaceful, with no arrests or incidents reported. The event was a reminder that the struggle for racial justice and police accountability continues, and that the community will not be silenced by a verdict that many see as unjust.
