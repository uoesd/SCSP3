Tiger Woods' Car Crash Investigation Raises Questions About Sheriff's Department's Handling

The recent car crash involving golf legend Tiger Woods has sparked controversy over the handling of the investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Forensic experts are scrutinizing the department's decisions, particularly the decision not to bring in a drug-recognition expert (DRE) to evaluate Woods for impairment at the scene.

Sheriff Alex Villanueva initially stated that there was no evidence of impairment and deemed the crash an "accident." However, experts argue that the absence of braking evidence and Woods' memory loss about driving could indicate impairment, warranting a DRE assessment.

"The lack of braking evidence is a red flag for impairment," said Charles Schack, President of Crash Experts. "It's possible that Woods was inattentive or asleep at the wheel, and a DRE assessment could have helped determine whether drugs or alcohol were a factor."

A DRE assessment involves a 12-step process, including questioning about medications and examining vital signs, without automatic blood testing. Sheriff Villanueva justified the decision not to use a DRE by citing the deputy's assessment of Woods as lucid and showing no signs of impairment.

However, accident reconstruction experts argue that the crash characteristics resemble those of a person falling asleep at the wheel. "The damage to the vehicle and the fact that Woods suffered broken bones in his right leg and facial injuries suggest that he may have been inattentive or asleep," said Jonathan Cherney, an accident reconstructionist.

Woods' memory loss about driving is also a cause for concern, according to experts. "It's unusual for someone to suffer memory loss after a crash, especially if they were not knocked unconscious," said Chris Taylor, Managing Attorney at Taylor & Taylor. "It's possible that Woods was impaired, and his memory loss is a result of that."

The lack of initial DRE assessment and blood evidence means it's now too late to obtain Woods' hospital blood and medical reports without his cooperation or a search warrant. "It's unfortunate that the Sheriff's Department didn't take the necessary steps to gather evidence at the scene," said Schack. "Now, it's difficult to determine whether Woods was impaired without his cooperation."

Sheriff's Deputy John Schloegl, who responded to the crash, stated that Woods was cooperative and showed no signs of impairment. However, experts argue that a DRE assessment would have provided a more thorough evaluation.

"A DRE assessment is designed to detect impairment, and it's a valuable tool for law enforcement," said Schack. "In this case, it's unclear why the Sheriff's Department didn't use a DRE, especially given the severity of the crash."

The Sheriff's Department's handling of the investigation has raised questions about their protocols and procedures. "It's important for law enforcement to follow proper protocols in cases like this to ensure that all possible factors are considered," said Taylor. "In this case, it appears that the Sheriff's Department may have fallen short."

The crash, which occurred on February 23, 2023, involved Woods' Genesis GV80 SUV rolling over multiple times after striking a tree. Woods suffered broken bones in his right leg and facial injuries, but no head injuries were reported.

The investigation is ongoing, and the Sheriff's Department has not ruled out the possibility of charges being filed. However, the lack of initial DRE assessment and blood evidence may make it difficult to determine whether Woods was impaired.

As the investigation continues, questions remain about the Sheriff's Department's handling of the case. "It's crucial that law enforcement takes a thorough and impartial approach in investigating high-profile cases like this," said Schack. "In this case, it's unclear whether that was done."
