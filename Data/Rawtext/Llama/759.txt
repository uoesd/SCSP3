Hollywood's Hypocrisy: Time for Stricter Firearms Safety Protocols on Movie Sets

As a journalist for Newsweek, I have been following the recent on-set shooting involving Alec Baldwin and the questions it has raised about firearm safety in the entertainment industry. The incident has sparked a heated debate, with SOFREP, a military and veteran-run news site, being one of the most vocal critics. In their article, SOFREP highlights the lack of firearm safety and terminology accuracy in the initial reports of the incident, and calls for stricter safety protocols on movie sets.

One of the key points raised by SOFREP is the use of actual firearms as "prop guns" in movie productions. The article questions the wisdom of using real firearms, which can be extremely dangerous if not handled properly, instead of replicas or non-functional props. This is particularly concerning when one considers the head armorer on the film, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, did not have any special training or licenses. In contrast, animal safety measures on movie sets are strictly regulated, with trained professionals overseeing the use of animals during filming.

Furthermore, SOFREP points out the close relationship between Hollywood and the firearms industry. Firearms are prominently featured and glorified in movies, and the industry relies heavily on the sale of firearms for entertainment. This has led to an increase in gun violence and the variety of firearms shown in movies over the years. It is hypocritical for Hollywood to advocate for gun control while simultaneously profiting from the glorification of firearms on screen.

Alec Baldwin's anti-NRA stance is also called into question by SOFREP, despite the industry's reliance on firearms for entertainment. The article suggests that Hollywood should require armorers to be NRA Certified Range Safety Officers to ensure firearms safety on sets. The NRA's role in firearms safety training, including for police and concealed carry permits, is emphasized.

In light of this incident, it is clear that stricter state requirements and special liability insurance for those handling firearms in film productions are necessary. The entertainment industry should adopt serious safety standards similar to those for animal safety. It is time for Hollywood to take responsibility for the safety of its actors and crew, and to ensure that firearms are handled properly on set.

In conclusion, the recent on-set shooting involving Alec Baldwin highlights the need for stricter firearms safety protocols in the entertainment industry. SOFREP's criticisms of the initial reports and the use of real firearms as "prop guns" are valid, and it is time for Hollywood to take action. By requiring armorers to be NRA Certified Range Safety Officers and adopting stricter safety standards, the industry can ensure the safety of its actors and crew, while also avoiding the hypocrisy of advocating for gun control while profiting from the glorification of firearms on screen. It is time for Hollywood to take responsibility for firearms safety and adopt serious safety standards, similar to those for animal safety.
