Bill to Honor Kyle Rittenhouse with Congressional Gold Medal Unlikely to Pass

In a move that has sparked controversy, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has introduced a bill to grant Kyle Rittenhouse the Congressional Gold Medal for his actions during a Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha, Wis. The bill claims that Rittenhouse, who was acquitted of intentional and reckless homicide after killing two men at the protest, deserves the honor for "protecting the community of Kenosha."

However, the bill is unlikely to pass due to the need for two-thirds co-sponsorship in a House controlled by Democrats, many of whom have criticized Rittenhouse's actions. Rep. Matt Gaetz's (R-Fla.) spokesperson commented that awarding Rittenhouse the medal could inflate his ego during a potential internship with Gaetz.

Greene has been a vocal supporter of Rittenhouse, commending his actions and celebrating his acquittal on social media. In contrast, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) supported the jury's decision, while Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) criticized it as a miscarriage of justice.

Rittenhouse argued that he was in Kenosha to protect local businesses with a rifle and medic kit, while prosecutors said he incited violence. The verdict received mixed reactions, with conservatives praising it and liberals denouncing it.

In a statement, Gaetz's spokesperson said, "While we appreciate Kyle Rittenhouse's enthusiasm, we're not sure that awarding him the Congressional Gold Medal is the best way to honor his actions. We don't want to inflate his ego, especially if he's considering an internship with us."

Overall, the bill to grant Rittenhouse the Congressional Gold Medal is unlikely to pass due to opposition from Democrats and concerns from some Republicans. The controversy surrounding Rittenhouse's actions and the verdict continues to divide opinions and spark debate.
