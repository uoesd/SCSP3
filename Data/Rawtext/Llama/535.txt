Biden Vows to 'Hunt Down' Kabul Airport Attackers, Calls Fallen Service Members 'Heroes'

President Joe Biden has vowed to "hunt down" those responsible for the deadly attack on Kabul's airport, which resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and dozens of Afghans. Speaking from the White House, Biden called the service members killed in the attack "heroes" and the "backbone of America," offering his condolences and leading a moment of silence.

The attack, which was carried out by Islamic State fighters, occurred outside the airport's Abbey Gate, where large crowds have been gathering for weeks in an attempt to flee the country amid the U.S. military withdrawal and Taliban takeover. Biden emphasized that terrorism would not deter the U.S. from continuing its evacuation mission or intimidate the nation.

"We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay," Biden said, addressing those responsible for the attack. "We will not be deterred by terrorism. We will not be intimidated. We will not be defeated."

Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of U.S. Central Command, confirmed that the attack involved a suicide bombing followed by Islamist State gunmen opening fire. He acknowledged a "failure somewhere" in security, as the bomber was being screened by American forces at a gate.

Despite the attack, ongoing evacuations have moved more than 104,000 civilians since August 14, including about 5,000 Americans. Another 12,500 people were evacuated between Thursday and Friday morning, following the attack, according to the White House.

The Pentagon corrected initial reports, clarifying that there was only one bombing, not two. The attack was the deadliest day for U.S. forces in Afghanistan since 2011.

Biden praised the service members killed in the attack, saying they were "the backbone of America."

"They were heroes, each and every one of them," Biden said. "They were the bravest of the brave. They were the best of the best. They were the backbone of America."

The president also emphasized the importance of the ongoing evacuation mission, saying the U.S. would continue to help those in need.

"We will continue to evacuate as many people as we can, as quickly as we can," Biden said. "We will not be deterred by terrorism. We will not be intimidated. We will not be defeated."
