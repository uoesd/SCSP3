Juror Describes Derek Chauvin Trial Deliberations as Relaxed and Methodical

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – Brandon Mitchell, the first juror to speak publicly about the Derek Chauvin trial, described the deliberations as relaxed and methodical, leading to a unanimous conviction. Chauvin was found guilty of second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd.

"It was a very relaxed and methodical process," Mitchell said in an interview with The Associated Press. "We took our time, we went through all the evidence, and we came to a unanimous decision."

Mitchell, who was juror No. 11, described the emotional toll of the trial as immense. "It was like attending a funeral every day," he said. "It was emotionally draining, but we knew we had a job to do."

The jury convicted Chauvin after deliberating for about 10 hours over two days. Mitchell said the jury took a preliminary vote on manslaughter first, then moved on to third-degree murder, and finally agreed on second-degree murder.

Mitchell highlighted the importance of video evidence and the testimony of Dr. Martin Tobin, a breathing expert, in reaching the verdict. "The video was huge for us," he said. "We watched it multiple times, and we could see how George Floyd's body was reacting. Dr. Tobin's testimony was also crucial in helping us understand the severity of the situation."

Mitchell thought the defense's strategy of portraying bystanders as a threat was ineffective since they didn't appear hostile. "We didn't see any evidence that the bystanders were a threat," he said. "They were just trying to help George Floyd."

Chauvin's choice not to testify did not impact the trial's outcome, according to Mitchell. "We didn't think much of it," he said. "We had all the evidence we needed to make a decision."

The juror felt no pressure to reach a verdict to prevent potential violent protests. "We knew there would be protests regardless of the outcome," he said. "We just wanted to make sure we made the right decision based on the evidence."

Mitchell was careful to hide his involvement in the trial from his basketball team and conversed little about the case with his family. "I didn't want to influence anyone's opinion," he said. "I just wanted to focus on the trial and make sure we made the right decision."

Mitchell refrained from predicting the outcome for the other three officers charged in Floyd's death, suggesting their trials might present different challenges. "Each case is unique," he said. "We'll have to wait and see what happens in their trials."

In conclusion, Brandon Mitchell, juror No. 11 in the Derek Chauvin trial, described the deliberations as relaxed and methodical, leading to a unanimous conviction. The jury convicted Chauvin of second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. Mitchell highlighted the importance of video evidence and the testimony of Dr. Martin Tobin, a breathing expert, in reaching the verdict. He also thought the defense's strategy of portraying bystanders as a threat was ineffective, and Chauvin's choice not to testify did not impact the trial's outcome.
