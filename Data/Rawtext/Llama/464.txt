Sussexes Strike Back: New Epilogue Addresses Racism Allegations and Royal Family Rift

In a surprising turn of events, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have included an updated epilogue in their book, "Finding Freedom," addressing the allegations of racism within the Royal Family that they made in their bombshell Oprah interview. The epilogue not only challenges the narrative that they did not want their son, Archie, to have a prince title, but also describes Meghan's experience with the interview as "cathartic" and "liberating."

The book takes aim at the Royal Family's handling of racism allegations, comparing it to their response to bullying claims against Meghan. A friend of the couple alleges that there has been little accountability from the Royal Family, highlighting the need for acknowledgment and progress. The epilogue also touches on the financial struggles faced by Meghan and Harry before their departure from royal duties, known as "Megxit."

In a heartfelt revelation, Harry reveals that he was "deeply saddened" by not being allowed to have a wreath laid in his name during Remembrance Sunday. However, his attendance at the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral marked a positive step towards familial reconciliation. The epilogue also details Harry's ongoing communication with his brother William, while being on "light speaking terms" with his father, Prince Charles.

Feelings within the Royal Family remain "raw" post-Oprah interview, but there is hope for healing through dialogue. The book suggests that acknowledgment of the Sussexes' experiences is necessary for progress, and that the Royal Family must take responsibility for addressing the issues of racism and bullying.

In conclusion, the updated epilogue in "Finding Freedom" provides a powerful response to the allegations made by Harry and Meghan, and highlights the need for change within the Royal Family. The book offers a glimmer of hope for reconciliation and healing, but also emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and addressing the experiences of those who have been affected by racism and bullying. The Sussexes' story continues to captivate and inspire, and their determination to create a better future for themselves and their son, Archie, is a testament to their strength and resilience.
