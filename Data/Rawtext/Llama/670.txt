Expert Testifies Rittenhouse's Shootings During Wisconsin Protest Were Justified

KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) – Use-of-force expert John Black testified at a pretrial hearing that Kyle Rittenhouse's decisions to shoot three people during a Wisconsin protest were justified, offering a preview of the defense strategy for Rittenhouse's trial set to begin next month.

Black outlined that the men Rittenhouse shot had attacked him and tried to take his gun. "Based on my analysis, it appears that Mr. Rittenhouse's use of deadly force was justified," Black said.

Rittenhouse, 17 at the time, went to Kenosha in response to a militia's call to protect businesses during protests sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake. He is charged with multiple counts, including homicide and being a minor in possession of a firearm.

Defense attorney Mark Richards seeks to have Black testify at the trial, subject to Judge Bruce Schroeder's approval. "We believe that Mr. Black's expertise on use of force will be valuable to the jury in understanding the circumstances surrounding the shootings," Richards said.

Prosecutors, however, question Black's expertise on civilian use of force and challenge the justification of lethal force without a gun. "We don't believe that Mr. Black's opinions are based on a reasonable interpretation of the evidence," said Thomas Binger, assistant district attorney.

Judge Schroeder denied a defense request to drop the weapons possession charge against Rittenhouse, citing unclear statutes. "I don't think it's appropriate to dismiss the charge at this point," Schroeder said.

The judge also denied a prosecution request to prevent media from broadcasting or publishing images of witnesses' faces, citing First Amendment concerns. "I don't think it's appropriate to restrict the media's ability to report on this case," Schroeder said.

Rittenhouse has become a polarizing figure, drawing support from conservatives as a patriot and criticism from liberals and activists as a domestic terrorist. His case has sparked debates over gun rights, police use of force, and the role of militias in society.

Black's testimony highlights the central issue of the case: whether Rittenhouse's use of deadly force was justified in the midst of a chaotic and violent protest. The defense argues that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, while the prosecution contends that he recklessly endangered lives and violated gun laws.

The trial is set to begin on February 16 and is expected to last several weeks. Rittenhouse faces life in prison if convicted of the most serious charges.

In conclusion, the testimony of use-of-force expert John Black offers a glimpse into the defense strategy for Kyle Rittenhouse's upcoming trial. The case has sparked intense debate and national attention, with many watching to see how the justice system will handle a controversial case that raises questions about gun rights, police use of force, and the role of militias in society.
