California Expands Golden State Stimulus, Aiming to Benefit 78% of Taxpayers

California has started sending out $600 Golden State Stimulus payments to millions of low-income households, and Gov. Gavin Newsom is proposing an expansion of the program to include the state's middle class. The expansion would triple the investment to $11.9 billion, allowing taxpayers earning up to $75,000 in adjusted gross income to qualify for the stimulus check.

Under the proposed expansion, families with dependents and those with undocumented workers filing taxes could receive additional funds. The initiative aims to benefit 78% of California taxpayers, covering two in three Californians.

The first round of payments targeted low-income taxpayers, families with children in CalWORKS, and recipients of certain state benefits. Undocumented tax filers were eligible for the first round if they met income criteria, with certain adjustments for those making less than $30,000.

As of early May, the state's tax agency distributed 2.5 million payments worth $1.6 billion from the first round, with more payments pending. People who received the first round of payments are generally not eligible for the second, with certain exceptions for taxpayers with dependents.

The plan requires legislative approval by June 15, with hopes to distribute payments quickly thereafter. If approved, California would become the first state to provide a second round of stimulus payments to residents.

Gov. Newsom announced the proposed expansion on May 10, highlighting the state's commitment to supporting low- and middle-income families. "We're not just talking about economic growth, we're talking about economic justice," he said.

The Golden State Stimulus is part of a broader effort by the state to address economic inequality. In 2020, California implemented a $600 credit for low-income workers, which was later expanded to include families with children.

The state's tax agency, the Franchise Tax Board, has been working to streamline the process for distributing the payments. "We're doing everything we can to get these payments out quickly and efficiently," said State Controller Betty Yee.

Eligible taxpayers do not need to apply for the stimulus payment, as the Franchise Tax Board will automatically issue payments to those who qualify. Taxpayers can check their eligibility and payment status on the state's tax website.

The Golden State Stimulus is a key component of Gov. Newsom's budget proposal for the 2022-23 fiscal year. The proposal also includes funding for education, healthcare, and wildfire prevention.

The proposed expansion of the stimulus program has received support from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. "This is a smart investment in our state's future," said Senate Republican Leader Shannon Grove.

However, some critics have raised concerns about the cost of the program and its potential impact on the state's budget. "We need to be mindful of our fiscal responsibility," said Assembly Republican Leader Marie Waldron.

Despite these concerns, Gov. Newsom remains committed to the Golden State Stimulus. "We're not just talking about a one-time payment, we're talking about a long-term investment in our state's future," he said.

The proposed expansion of the Golden State Stimulus is a significant step towards addressing economic inequality in California. If approved, it would provide much-needed relief to millions of residents, helping to ensure that the state's economic growth is shared by all.
