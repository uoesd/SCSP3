AOC Slams Facebook's Monopoly During Blackout, Highlighting Threat to Democracy

In the wake of Facebook's recent blackout, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) took the opportunity to criticize the tech giant's monopolistic behavior, arguing that its unchecked power poses a threat to democracy and free society.

During the blackout, which affected users worldwide, AOC took to Twitter to highlight Facebook's history of acquiring or destroying competitors, such as WhatsApp and Instagram. She emphasized that Facebook's dominance in the market allows it to stifle competition and limit choices for consumers.

"Facebook's monopolistic behavior is a threat to our democracy and free society," AOC tweeted. "We need to take a closer look at their business practices and ensure that they are not using their power to suppress competition and limit choices for consumers."

José Caparroso, editor of Forbes, also noted the significant impact of the blackout in Latin America, where WhatsApp is a widely used platform for communication. Despite the availability of alternative messaging apps like Viber, the outage underscored Facebook's influence in the region.

Facebook is currently facing an antitrust lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission, which challenges the company's monopolistic practices. In response, Facebook has defended itself, claiming that it has not violated any antitrust laws. A judge's decision is expected by mid-November.

The blackout, which began on Monday at noon, was likely caused by an issue with Facebook's Domain Name System. The outage had a significant impact on the company's bottom line, with Mark Zuckerberg's personal wealth dropping by $6 billion due to the outage, reducing his fortune to around the GDP of Angola.

AOC's criticism of Facebook's monopoly comes at a time when the company's content moderation policies are also under scrutiny. The outage has highlighted the tech giant's influence on national discourse and the importance of ensuring that its power is not used to suppress competition and limit choices for consumers.

In conclusion, Facebook's recent blackout has brought attention to the company's monopolistic behavior and the need for greater scrutiny of its business practices. As AOC noted, Facebook's dominance in the market poses a threat to democracy and free society, and it is essential that we take a closer look at their practices to ensure that they are not using their power to suppress competition and limit choices for consumers.
