Texas Regulators Approve Plan to Raise Gas Bills to Pay $3.4 Billion to Gas Companies

Texas regulators have approved a plan to raise gas bills for residents and businesses to pay $3.4 billion to gas companies for winter storm-related profits. The payment, which will be spread out over 30 years, covers unexpected debt from skyrocketing gas prices during February's winter storm and blackout.

The move by the Railroad Commission of Texas is part of a process known as securitization, approved by state legislators last spring. Securitization aims to spread out the financial impact on consumers by converting debt into low-interest bonds paid over decades.

During the winter storm, gas prices surged, leading to massive profits for gas companies and accusations of price gouging. The Railroad Commission of Texas has been criticized for prioritizing gas company profits over consumer needs.

"This is a bailout for the gas industry, plain and simple," said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, a watchdog group that monitors the Railroad Commission. "The commission is putting the profits of gas companies ahead of the needs of Texas families and businesses."

Paula Gold-Williams, former head of San Antonio's publicly owned utility, expressed concern about the long-term impact of securitization on consumers. "We're essentially mortgaging the future of our state to pay for a short-term crisis," she said.

Doug Lewin, head of Stoic Energy, a renewable energy company, criticized the commission's handling of the situation and potential future risks. "The Railroad Commission is putting consumers on the hook for billions of dollars in debt, without any guarantee that this won't happen again in the future," he said.

Governor Greg Abbott has also faced criticism for receiving a $1 million campaign contribution from Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, a gas company that stood to benefit from the securitization plan.

The cost of the securitization plan may be added to Texans' gas bills for up to 30 years, but it remains unclear how much monthly bills will increase for individual ratepayers. The Railroad Commission has not provided details on how the cost will be allocated among consumers.

Critics argue that the securitization plan is a short-term fix that does not address the root causes of the winter storm's impact on gas prices. "We need to focus on investing in renewable energy and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, rather than bailing out gas companies," said Palacios.

The securitization plan has sparked debate about the role of the Railroad Commission in regulating the gas industry. Some argue that the commission is too close to the industry it is supposed to regulate. "The Railroad Commission has a long history of putting the interests of gas companies ahead of consumers," said Lewin. "This plan is just the latest example of that."

The winter storm that hit Texas in February caused widespread power outages and disrupted the gas supply, leading to a spike in gas prices. Gas companies have been accused of price gouging, and some have faced lawsuits over their pricing practices during the storm.

The securitization plan is seen as a way to mitigate the financial impact of the winter storm on gas companies, but critics argue that it does not address the underlying issues that led to the price surge. "We need to address the lack of transparency and accountability in the gas industry, rather than just bailing out companies that profited from the crisis," said Gold-Williams.

The Railroad Commission has defended the securitization plan, arguing that it is necessary to ensure the financial stability of the gas industry. "We understand that this plan may not be popular with everyone, but we believe it is necessary to protect the interests of consumers and the gas industry," said a spokesperson for the commission.

The plan has sparked a larger debate about the future of energy in Texas. Some argue that the state should invest more in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. "We need to move away from fossil fuels and towards a more sustainable energy future," said Lewin.

Others argue that the state should focus on improving its energy infrastructure to prevent future price surges. "We need to invest in our energy infrastructure to ensure that we can meet the demands of our growing state," said Gold-Williams.

The securitization plan is expected to be implemented in the coming months, but the debate over the future of energy in Texas is likely to continue for years to come.
