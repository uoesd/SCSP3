Strengthening Ties and Addressing Global Challenges: Vice President Harris Welcomes Prime Minister Modi to the White House

It is an honor to welcome Prime Minister Modi of India to the White House today, marking his first trip outside South Asia in 16 months. This visit highlights the strong bond between our two nations and our shared commitment to addressing the pressing global challenges of our time.

As Vice President of the United States, I am proud to say that India is a crucial partner to our country, with a history of cooperation that spans decades. Our discussions in June emphasized the interconnectedness of the world and the shared challenges we face, including COVID-19 and the climate crisis.

India's role in distributing vaccines early in the pandemic and its efforts in vaccinating its population during a COVID surge have been truly impressive. We are proud to have supported India with vaccines during its COVID surge, and we welcome India's plan to resume vaccine exports. The impressive vaccination rate of approximately 10 million people a day in India is a testament to the country's commitment to protecting its citizens and contributing to the global effort to combat the pandemic.

The climate crisis is another significant issue that requires our collective action. Both our nations recognize the importance of our partnership in addressing environmental challenges. We share a commitment to preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific region, where all nations can thrive and prosper.

As democratic nations, we also share a common commitment to defending democratic principles and institutions against global threats to democracy. We must continue to work together to strengthen our democratic systems and promote the values of freedom, equality, and human rights.

I am eager to discuss ways to strengthen U.S.-India relations and address the mutual challenges and opportunities that we face. Our partnership has the potential to drive economic growth, promote innovation, and enhance regional stability. We must continue to work together to promote peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.

In conclusion, the visit of Prime Minister Modi to the White House marks a significant moment in the history of U.S.-India relations. We have a unique opportunity to strengthen our partnership and address the pressing global challenges of our time. Let us work together to build a brighter future for our nations and the world. Thank you.
