House Votes to Create Independent Commission to Investigate Jan. 6 Capitol Attack

WASHINGTON, May 19 – In a bipartisan vote, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to create an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, despite opposition from House Republican leaders. The bill, which mirrors the structure of the 9/11 Commission, aims to produce a report with recommendations to prevent future attacks and to examine security failures.

The bill passed with 35 Republicans voting in favor, a significant number considering House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell both opposed the commission. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer noted that McCarthy received his requested compromises on the commission's structure, but still opposed the bill.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the need for the commission, endorsing existing Congressional investigations instead. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested the possibility of conducting regular committee hearings if the Senate blocks the commission.

The proposed commission has gained support from some Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins, who expressed willingness to consider the bill with modifications. Former President Donald Trump, on the other hand, urged Republicans to oppose the commission, labeling it a "trap" set by "the radical left."

Republican Representative John Katko, a co-sponsor of the bill, emphasized the importance of an independent investigation. "We need to get to the bottom of what happened on January 6 and make sure it never happens again," he said.

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, echoed Katko's sentiments. "We cannot allow political considerations to get in the way of a thorough and independent investigation," he said.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed his support for the commission, stating, "The American people deserve a comprehensive and independent investigation into the January 6 attack."

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also voiced her support, saying, "We must take a comprehensive look at the security failures that led to the attack and ensure that they are not repeated."

Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, suggested that the commission could be useful in addressing security concerns. "I think it's important to have a comprehensive investigation into what happened on January 6," she said.

However, not all Republicans are on board with the commission. Senator John Cornyn expressed his opposition, stating, "I don't think we need another commission to tell us what we already know."

Democratic Representative Zoe Lofgren, House Administration Committee Chair, emphasized the need for a bipartisan approach to the investigation. "We must work together to ensure that the commission is fair, impartial, and effective," she said.

Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a vocal opponent of the commission, argued that it would be a waste of time and resources. "We don't need a commission to tell us what we already know," she said. "We need to focus on securing our borders and protecting our country."

Despite opposition from some Republicans, the bill's supporters remain optimistic about its chances in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed to bring the bill to a vote, stating, "The American people deserve to know the truth about what happened on January 6."

The proposed commission has also gained support from outside groups, including the 9/11 Families & Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism. "We know firsthand the importance of a comprehensive and independent investigation," said Terry Strada, the group's national chair. "We urge the Senate to follow the House's lead and pass this bill."

The bill's passage in the House marks a significant step towards a comprehensive investigation into the Jan. 6 attack. With bipartisan support and growing momentum, the commission may soon become a reality, providing a crucial step towards healing and accountability.
