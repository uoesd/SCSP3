Tiger Woods Injured in Serious Car Accident in Los Angeles

LOS ANGELES (AP) – Tiger Woods was seriously injured in a single-car accident in suburban Los Angeles early Tuesday morning. The crash occurred around 7:15 a.m. local time and Woods had to be extricated from his SUV, which rolled over and was heavily damaged.

According to Mark Steinberg, Woods' manager, the golf legend was undergoing surgery for multiple leg injuries following the accident. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear, but the vehicle was found off the road and down an embankment.

Christopher Thomas, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department, said that Woods was hospitalized after the accident. "Tiger Woods was transported to a local hospital for treatment of his injuries," Thomas said.

The accident involved only Woods' vehicle, and there were no other injuries reported. However, a second minor crash occurred near the scene with a vehicle that had stopped to help.

Woods was in Los Angeles for the Genesis Invitational and a TV shoot with GOLFTV. The accident follows a history of physical setbacks for Woods, including numerous surgeries. This is the third time Woods has been involved in a car investigation.

Athletes and celebrities have expressed concern and hopes for Woods' quick recovery. "Sending my thoughts and prayers to @TigerWoods and his family," tweeted NBA star LeBron James. "Hoping for a speedy recovery and looking forward to seeing him back on the course soon."

Woods, 45, has won 82 PGA Tour events and 15 major championships, making him one of the most successful golfers of all time. He has been plagued by injuries in recent years, including a back surgery in 2017 that kept him out of golf for several months.

The golf community has rallied around Woods, expressing support and well wishes. "We are all thinking of Tiger and wishing him a speedy recovery," said Rory McIlroy, a fellow golfer. "He's a true champion and a fighter, and I have no doubt he'll be back on the course soon."

The accident is a serious setback for Woods, who has been working to regain his form and fitness after a series of injuries. It remains to be seen how long he will be out of action, but his fans and fellow athletes are hoping for a speedy recovery.
