Evergreen Marine's Strict Management Style Under Scrutiny After Suez Canal Incident

Evergreen Marine Corp., the operator of the cargo ship that was stuck in the Suez Canal for a week, is known for its strict, top-down management style. The company, founded by Chang Yung-fa in 1968, has grown to become one of the largest container shipping companies in the world, with a fleet of over 200 vessels. However, the recent accident has raised questions about the effectiveness of this management style and whether it may have contributed to the incident.

According to Stone Huang, Taiwan Managing Director of JAS Worldwide, "Evergreen Marine has a reputation for being very strict and disciplined in their operations. They have a top-down management style, where every decision is made by the headquarters in Taiwan." This strict management style has been attributed to the company's low accident rate prior to the Suez Canal incident.

The accident, which occurred when the Ever Given ship deviated from its course and became stuck in the canal, has sparked investigations into its cause. While Evergreen Marine has cited gusty winds as a reason for the ship's deviation, investigators are looking into various factors, including the operator, shipowner, weather, and the canal itself.

Liang Kuo-yuan, President of Polaris Research Institute, notes that the incident may not significantly damage Evergreen's reputation due to high demand for sea freight. "Evergreen Marine is a well-established company with a long history, and they have a strong reputation in the industry. The demand for sea freight is still high, so I don't think this incident will have a major impact on their business," he said.

However, some observers suggest that the management style at Evergreen may have shifted from its original strictness. Cathy Chin, Chairperson of the Taiwan International Logistics & Supply Chain Association, notes that the company has undergone changes in recent years. "After the founder's death, there was a dispute over inheritance among his sons, and this may have affected the company's management style," she said.

The Suez Canal incident has also raised questions about the appropriateness of large vessels for certain shipping routes. According to Huang, "The Suez Canal is a narrow waterway, and it's not suitable for large vessels like the Ever Given. Perhaps it's time for shipping companies to reconsider the routes they take and the size of their vessels."

In conclusion, the Suez Canal incident involving Evergreen Marine's cargo ship has brought the company's management style under scrutiny. While the incident may not significantly damage the company's reputation, it highlights the need for shipping companies to reassess their operations and ensure that they are taking the necessary precautions to avoid such incidents in the future.
