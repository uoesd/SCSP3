Hurricane Ida's Impact on U.S. Energy Production and Refining

Hurricane Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, on August 29 as a Category 4 hurricane, causing significant disruptions to U.S. energy production and refining. According to the U.S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, 96% of crude oil production and 94% of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico were shut in due to the storm.

At least nine refineries were forced to shut down or reduce production because of Hurricane Ida. As a result, gross inputs into Gulf Coast refineries fell by 1.6 million barrels per day, and crude oil inventories in the Gulf Coast region decreased by 2.6 million barrels. U.S. crude oil production also fell by 1.5 million barrels per day from August 27 to September 3.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) September Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) forecasts for crude oil production and refinery runs were reduced due to the impact of Hurricane Ida. However, Gulf of Mexico crude oil production is expected to return to previously forecast levels in October.

In related news, Hurricane Nicholas made landfall as a Category 1 storm near Houston on September 14, impacting Colonial Pipeline operations. According to trade press reports, Colonial Pipeline has resumed normal operations, and the Houston Ship Channel is expected to reopen.

Overall, Hurricane Ida's impact on U.S. energy production and refining has been significant, but the industry is working to restore operations and return to normal levels. The EIA will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary.
