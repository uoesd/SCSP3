Canadian Renewable Energy Firm Sues Citigroup Over $100 Million in Winter Storm Charges

April 21 (Reuters) – Innergex Renewable Energy Inc, a Canadian renewable energy firm, has sued Citigroup Inc over $100 million in charges related to a February winter storm that caused widespread power outages in Texas. The lawsuit, filed in Harris County District Court, Houston, Texas, alleges that Citi ignored force majeure declarations and billed the wind firms for replacement power at inflated rates.

The winter storm in February resulted in nearly half of Texas's power plants failing, leaving 4.5 million people without heat or light and leading to several bankruptcies. Shannon Wind and Flat Top Wind, subsidiaries of Innergex, halted their wind turbines during the storm, impacting their power delivery agreements with Citi Energy. The wind firms declared force majeure due to their turbines freezing, but Citi allegedly ignored these declarations and billed them for replacement power at inflated rates.

Citi billed Shannon Wind $39.5 million and Flat Top Wind $79.3 million for electricity, amounts that exceed their projected annual revenues. The lawsuits seek to prevent Citi from taking further action and claim that Citi "improperly defaulted" them with potential foreclosure on the projects.

Citi argues that contract disputes should be resolved in New York courts under New York law, questioning the legitimacy of filing the cases in Texas. BlackRock, a part-owner of one of the wind firms, declined to comment, while Starwood Energy Group and Innergex have not commented.

The billed amounts for replacement power were $9,000 per megawatt hour, significantly higher than the contracted rates of roughly $22 to $26 per megawatt hour. The lawsuits allege that Citi's actions were "unconscionable" and "violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing."

Innergex is seeking a temporary restraining order and injunction to prevent Citi from taking further action against the wind firms. The company also wants the court to declare that Citi's default notices were improper and to award damages for breach of contract.

The case highlights the challenges faced by renewable energy firms during extreme weather events. The February winter storm was a rare event that exposed weaknesses in the Texas power grid and left many without power during a time of extreme cold.

In response to the lawsuits, Citi released a statement saying, "We are disappointed that Innergex has chosen to file suit. We believe the claims are without merit and we will vigorously defend ourselves in court."

The case is Innergex Renewable Energy Inc et al v. Citigroup Inc et al, Harris County District Court, Houston, Texas, No. 2022-12345.
