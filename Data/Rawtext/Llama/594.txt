Empowering Women, Strengthening Democracy: A Call to Action

Madam Chair, distinguished members of the Commission on the Status of Women, esteemed guests, and fellow advocates for gender equality, it is an honor to address this esteemed body today. As Vice President of the United States, I am proud to represent a nation that has long recognized the importance of promoting gender equality and empowering women.

Since its inception in 1947, the Commission on the Status of Women has played a vital role in advancing the rights of women and girls worldwide. The Commission's tireless efforts have helped to bring attention to the systemic barriers and discrimination that women continue to face, and have pushed for greater gender equality in all aspects of life.

As we gather here today, we are reminded of the intrinsic link between democracy and gender equality. Democracy, at its core, is about ensuring that every citizen has an equal voice and the opportunity to participate fully in the decision-making processes that shape their lives. Gender equality, in turn, is essential to the health and vibrancy of democracy. When women are empowered, democracy is strengthened.

Unfortunately, we are facing a troubling trend. Over the past 15 years, we have seen a decline in global freedom, with the past year being the worst for global democracy and freedom. This decline has been driven, in part, by the erosion of civil liberties, the suppression of dissenting voices, and the marginalization of vulnerable communities, including women.

In light of the current global health and economic crises, it is more important than ever that we defend democracy and promote gender equality. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant threats to women's economic, physical security, and health worldwide. Women have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, with many facing increased burdens in the workplace, at home, and in their communities.

But in the face of these challenges, we must not lose sight of the progress that has been made. In the United States, we have seen historic participation of women in elections, Congress, and leadership roles. We have also made significant strides in advancing women's rights and opportunities, from the passage of the Women's Suffrage Amendment to the landmark Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade.

Of course, there is still much work to be done. That is why the United States is committed to strengthening its engagement with the United Nations and rejoining the Human Rights Council. We recognize the critical role that international cooperation and multilateral institutions play in promoting gender equality and defending democracy.

Furthermore, we are revitalizing our partnerships with organizations that empower women globally. We are working to address the systemic barriers that prevent women from fully participating in society, from discriminatory laws and practices to gender-based violence and discrimination.

As we look to the future, we must remember the wise words of Eleanor Roosevelt, who said, "Democracy is not just a form of government; it is a way of life." It is a way of life that values equality, justice, and human dignity. It is a way of life that recognizes the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of their gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

In conclusion, let us reaffirm our commitment to upholding democratic values and improving the status of women. Let us continue to work together to ensure that every woman and girl has the opportunity to reach their full potential and live their lives with dignity. And let us never forget that the empowerment of women is not only a fundamental human right, but also a necessary condition for building strong, healthy, and prosperous democracies. Thank you.
