Tragic Accident on the Set of "Rust": Alec Baldwin Involved in Fatal Shooting Incident

In a shocking turn of events, a tragic accident occurred on the set of the upcoming movie "Rust," starring Alec Baldwin, resulting in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injury of director Joel Souza. The incident took place during a rehearsal at the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Thursday, October 21.

According to the affidavit for a search warrant, cameraman Reid Russell described Alec Baldwin as "very careful with firearms" on set. However, the affidavit also reveals that assistant director Dave Halls was unaware of live rounds in the prop gun given to Baldwin.

Detective Joel Cano's affidavit details the sequence of events leading up to the tragic shooting. According to Cano, director Joel Souza and cinematographer Halyna Hutchins were preparing a scene when Baldwin discharged the firearm. The affidavit suggests that only one bullet was fired, which went through Hutchins and then struck Souza.

Hutchins reportedly said she couldn't feel her legs before receiving medical attention. The affidavit highlights that the film's crew had issues, including a walkout by seven camera crew members hours before the incident. Detective Cano noted challenges on the set, such as delays caused by having to find a replacement camera crew.

The spent casing from the fired prop gun was retrieved by the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, indicating a single shot was fired. In a statement, Gutierrez said, "I checked the gun and saw that there was one live round in the chamber."

The Santa Fe Sheriff's Department and District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies have announced a joint press conference regarding the investigation. Carmack-Altwies stated, "This is a tragic incident, and our hearts go out to the family of Halyna Hutchins and all those affected by this senseless act."

Baldwin, who was questioned by authorities, expressed his devastation over the incident. In a statement, he said, "My heart is broken for Halyna Hutchins, her family, and all those affected by this tragic accident. I'm fully cooperating with the authorities to ensure that the truth is revealed."

The incident has sparked a renewed debate about gun safety on movie sets. Dave Halls, the assistant director who handed Baldwin the prop gun, said in a statement, "I'm deeply saddened by this tragic accident. I'm cooperating fully with the investigation to ensure that we understand how this happened and prevent it from happening again in the future."

The film's director, Joel Souza, who was also injured in the incident, expressed his gratitude for the support he has received. In a statement, he said, "I'm grateful for the outpouring of love and support I've received. My thoughts are with Halyna Hutchins and her family during this difficult time."

The investigation into the tragic accident is ongoing, with the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department and District Attorney's office working together to determine the cause of the shooting and any potential wrongdoing. As the film industry mourns the loss of one of its own, the incident serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of safety on set.
