Ever Given's Captain and Crew Pictured for First Time Since Suez Canal Blockage

The captain and crew of the Ever Given, the container ship that caused a global trade disruption by blocking the Suez Canal for six days, have been pictured for the first time since the incident. Captain Krishnan Kanthavel and his crew were photographed on board the ship, which is currently being held in the Great Bitter Lake.

The Ever Given, owned by Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd, was stuck in the Suez Canal for six days, causing significant delays in global trade. The incident is estimated to have cost world trade around £7 billion a day, with over 400 ships being held up due to the blockage.

Abdulgani Serang, General Secretary of the National Union of Seafarers of India, praised the crew's hard work and professionalism during the incident. "The crew of the Ever Given did an excellent job in ensuring the safety of the ship and its cargo during the blockage," he said.

A $1 billion compensation deal was negotiated between the Ever Given's owners and the Suez Canal Authority, while Egypt lost an estimated £15 million in transit fees each day the canal was blocked.

The Ever Given was held in the Great Bitter Lake for four months before being released. The ship is carrying goods worth over £650 million, some of which may have perished, including food items.

Investigations into the incident have begun, with no official outcome announced yet. Egypt plans to widen and deepen the canal section and upgrade its rescue fleet to prevent such incidents in the future.

Captain Kanthavel expressed his gratitude to the authorities and the ship's owner for their support during the incident. "We are grateful for the support and cooperation we received from the Suez Canal Authority and our ship's owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd, during this challenging time," he said.

The Ever Given's crew has been praised for their professionalism and hard work during the incident. "We are proud of the crew's dedication and commitment to ensuring the safety of the ship and its cargo," said a spokesperson for Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd.

The incident has highlighted the importance of ensuring the safety and efficiency of global trade routes. "We must learn from this incident and take steps to prevent such disruptions in the future," said Serang.

In conclusion, the Ever Given's blockage of the Suez Canal has had a significant impact on global trade, causing delays and losses estimated to be in the billions. The crew's hard work and professionalism have been praised, and investigations into the incident are ongoing. Egypt's plans to upgrade its rescue fleet and widen and deepen the canal section are a step in the right direction towards preventing such incidents in the future.
