Suez Canal Authority Announces Six Percent Toll Increase, Supports LNG and Cruise Ships

The Suez Canal Authority has announced a six percent increase in toll rates for most vessels, effective February 2022. The decision comes after a year of record traffic and amidst increased competition. In a statement, Admiral Osama Rabea, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, emphasized a balanced approach to the toll increase, considering global economic conditions and competition.

The Authority has, however, exempted LNG carriers and cruise ships from the toll increase to support these sectors. The rate for LNG carriers is being modified from 25 percent to 15 percent. This move aims to support the restoration of cruise ship traffic, which has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Suez Canal set a new record for transits in October with 1,847 transits, representing a 12 percent increase in revenues. The highest daily transits recorded were on September 29, 2021, with 87 vessels. During the first ten months of 2021, the canal saw a nearly nine percent increase in tonnage compared to the previous year.

Admiral Rabea stated that the Authority is preparing for continued strong volumes and is upgrading its operations to enhance service. "We are committed to maintaining the Suez Canal's position as a vital artery of global trade and a driver of economic growth," he said.

The Suez Canal Authority's decision to increase tolls comes as the canal faces increased competition from other shipping routes, such as the Panama Canal and the Northern Sea Route. However, the Authority remains confident in the canal's competitiveness and its ability to maintain its market share.

In recent years, the Suez Canal has invested heavily in expansion and modernization projects, including the construction of a new canal and the deepening and widening of existing waterways. These projects have increased the canal's capacity and reduced transit times, making it an attractive option for shippers.

Despite the toll increase, the Suez Canal Authority remains committed to supporting the growth of global trade and commerce. "We will continue to work closely with our customers and partners to ensure that the Suez Canal remains a vital link in the global supply chain," said Admiral Rabea.

In conclusion, the Suez Canal Authority's decision to increase tolls by six percent is a reflection of the canal's strong performance and its commitment to supporting the growth of global trade. The exemption of LNG carriers and cruise ships from the toll increase demonstrates the Authority's willingness to support key sectors and adapt to changing market conditions. As the Suez Canal continues to invest in its infrastructure and operations, it remains well-positioned to maintain its position as a vital artery of global trade.
