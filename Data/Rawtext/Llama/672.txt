Rittenhouse Attorney Mark Richards Slams Lin Wood, John Pierce for 'Idiotic' Behavior and Fundraising Efforts

Kyle Rittenhouse's attorney, Mark Richards, has criticized pro-Trump lawyer Lin Wood and attorney John Pierce for their behavior and fundraising efforts during Rittenhouse's trial. In an interview with Newsweek, Richards called Wood an "idiot" and accused him and Pierce of trying to use Rittenhouse for their financial gain and personal agendas.

"Lin Wood and John Pierce are idiots," Richards said. "They're trying to monetize Kyle Rittenhouse for their own personal gain. They don't care about Kyle, they don't care about justice, they only care about lining their own pockets."

Richards' comments come after Wood and Pierce faced criticism for their fundraising efforts for Rittenhouse's bail, leading to demands for the return of funds. GOP Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized Wood over the bail money issue, to which he bizarrely responded by calling her "a communist."

"It's unfortunate that Lin Wood and John Pierce are trying to profit off of Kyle's situation," Richards said. "They're using him for their own gain, and it's not right. They're not looking out for Kyle's best interests, they're only looking out for their own bank accounts."

Wood and Pierce have been involved in numerous controversial cases, including the defense of Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann, who was involved in a viral confrontation with a Native American activist. They have also filed numerous election fraud lawsuits challenging President Joe Biden's 2020 victory, and have continued promoting conspiracy theories.

The jury found Rittenhouse not guilty on all counts, including intentional and reckless homicide, among others. During his trial, Rittenhouse argued that he acted in self-defense during the protest.

"I'm just glad that the jury saw the truth and found Kyle not guilty," Richards said. "He's a young man who was put in a terrible situation, and he acted in self-defense. He didn't deserve to be charged with these crimes, and I'm glad that justice was served."

In response to Richards' comments, Wood released a statement claiming that his fundraising efforts for Rittenhouse were legal and criticizing Richards' remarks as baseless.

"I am disappointed, but not surprised, by Mark Richards' baseless attacks on me and my colleagues," Wood said. "We have done nothing wrong, and our fundraising efforts for Kyle Rittenhouse were completely legal. We are proud of the work we have done to help Kyle, and we will continue to support him in any way we can."

Pierce also defended his involvement, describing the controversy over the bail money as a distraction meant to discredit him.

"The attacks on us are just a distraction from the real issue here, which is the gross injustice that Kyle Rittenhouse was subjected to," Pierce said. "We are proud to have played a role in helping Kyle, and we will continue to fight for justice for him and for all Americans."

Despite the controversy surrounding Wood and Pierce's involvement, Rittenhouse's acquittal has been seen as a victory for those who believe he acted in self-defense. However, the case has also highlighted the ongoing debate over gun rights and the use of force during protests.

"This case has brought attention to the important issue of self-defense and the Second Amendment," Richards said. "Kyle had every right to defend himself, and the jury recognized that. I hope that this case will help to bring about positive change and protect the rights of all Americans."

In conclusion, the controversy surrounding Lin Wood and John Pierce's involvement in Kyle Rittenhouse's case has brought attention to the ongoing debate over gun rights and the use of force during protests. While Wood and Pierce have faced criticism for their fundraising efforts, Rittenhouse's acquittal has been seen as a victory for those who believe he acted in self-defense. As the case continues to make headlines, it remains to be seen how the controversy will play out and what impact it will have on the ongoing debate over gun rights and self-defense.
