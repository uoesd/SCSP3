Unprecedented Security Measures in Place for Biden's Inauguration

Washington CNN – With less than a week until President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, security measures in the nation's capital are being ramped up to unprecedented levels. More than 20,000 National Guard members are expected to be deployed in Washington D.C. to secure the event, with the US Secret Service officially in charge of Biden's inauguration security.

The massive security effort involves coordination among the Secret Service, federal law enforcement agencies, and the Pentagon, with security perimeters expanding around the Capitol, White House, and National Naval Observatory. The total request for National Guard support stands at nearly 30,000, with an expected final need of approximately 20,000.

FBI Director Chris Wray has expressed concerns over the possibility of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) being used in unrest related to the inauguration. "We are concerned about the potential for violence and the use of IEDs, and we are working closely with our partners to mitigate those threats," Wray said in a statement.

Washington, D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee echoed Wray's concerns, stating that his department is taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of the public. "We are working closely with our federal partners to ensure that the inauguration is safe and secure. We have deployed additional resources and are taking all necessary measures to protect the public," Contee said.

Ken Cuccinelli, the DHS Senior Official performing the duties of the Deputy Secretary, emphasized the importance of coordination among law enforcement agencies. "We are working closely with our federal, state, and local partners to ensure a safe and secure inauguration. We have a robust security plan in place, and we are confident that we are doing everything we can to protect the public," Cuccinelli said.

The heightened security measures come in the wake of the January 6th breach of the Capitol building, which has raised concerns about the potential for violence and terrorism. Discussions are underway about possibly raising the national terror threat level, and the Secret Service is leading inauguration security efforts amid concerns of increased potential for attacks.

The number of National Guard members for the inauguration exceeds the number of active-duty US troops in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria combined, highlighting the unprecedented nature of the security measures in place.

In addition to the National Guard, federal law enforcement agencies, and the Secret Service, local police departments from across the country are also providing support for the inauguration. The massive security effort is expected to cost tens of millions of dollars, with the final cost still unknown.

Despite the heightened security measures, officials are urging the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity. "We want the public to be aware of their surroundings and to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement. We are doing everything we can to ensure the safety of the public, but we need the public's help in this effort," Contee said.

As the nation prepares for the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, the message from law enforcement agencies is clear: they are taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of the public. With the unprecedented security measures in place, officials are confident that the inauguration will be a safe and successful event.
