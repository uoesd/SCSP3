Winter Storms Wreak Havoc Across the South, Leaving Dozens Dead and Millions Without Power

A second winter storm in a week has hit the South, bringing more ice and snow to Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The storm has already caused at least 30 deaths, with the new storm bringing up to 9 inches of snow in some areas.

In Texas, freezing rain in Austin and San Antonio has left everything covered in a layer of ice. The storm moved through Oklahoma and Texas and is now affecting the Deep South. Severe storms with potential for damaging winds, hail, and tornadoes are expected across the Gulf Coast.

Millions in Texas are without power, and Houston faces a crisis with frozen and burst pipes. "This is a serious situation that requires immediate attention," said Judge Lina Hidalgo, the elected leader of Harris County. "We need to make sure that our residents are safe and that we're doing everything we can to prevent further damage."

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner echoed Hidalgo's concerns. "We're dealing with a major crisis here in Houston," he said. "We've got millions of people without power, and we're doing everything we can to restore it as quickly as possible."

The power outages have also affected water treatment plants, leaving nearly 7 million people in Texas under a boil water advisory. "We're working around the clock to restore power to our water treatment plants," said Houston Chief Medical Officer Dr. David Persse. "In the meantime, we're urging residents to boil their water before drinking it to ensure their safety."

Houston hospitals are also facing power outages and low water pressure, affecting essential medical services. "We're doing everything we can to keep our patients safe and comfortable," said a spokesperson for Houston Methodist Hospital. "We're working closely with city officials to address the situation and ensure that our patients receive the care they need."

At least 22 states have delayed or canceled COVID-19 vaccinations due to the storm. President Joe Biden spoke with governors and assured federal assistance for the affected states. "We're doing everything we can to support the affected states and ensure that they have the resources they need to respond to this crisis," he said.

The storm is expected to continue affecting the region for the next few days, with temperatures expected to remain below freezing for the next 24 to 48 hours. Residents are being urged to stay inside and avoid travel if possible.

In conclusion, the winter storms that have hit the South this week have caused widespread damage and disruption, leaving dozens dead and millions without power. The situation is dire, and residents are being urged to take precautions to ensure their safety. The federal government has assured support for the affected states, and efforts are underway to restore power and water services as quickly as possible.
