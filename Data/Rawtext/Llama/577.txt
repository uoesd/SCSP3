Suicide Bombing at Shiite Mosque in Kandahar Kills at Least 50, Wounds 100

ISLAMABAD – A suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Kandahar, Afghanistan has killed at least 50 people and wounded over 100, marking the second major bombing in the country within a week. The attack has raised concerns about the rise of militant groups following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan.

The bombing occurred during Friday prayers at the Imam Bargah mosque in Kandahar city, with eyewitnesses reporting multiple explosions and gunfire at the scene. "I was inside the mosque when I heard a loud explosion, followed by gunfire. I saw people lying on the ground, covered in blood," said Abdul Jabar Karimi, an eyewitness.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, although a similar bombing in Kunduz last week was claimed by the Islamic State. The Islamic State considers Shiite Muslims heretics and has targeted their places of worship in the past.

The attack highlights fears that the Taliban is unable to control other militant groups, including Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. "The Taliban's inability to prevent such attacks raises questions about their ability to maintain security in the country," said Hafiz Abdul Hai Abbas, health director for the province.

A Taliban police chief was killed by the Islamic State in Konar province just a day before the Kandahar mosque attack. The Taliban, now controlling the entire country, faces pressure to maintain security nationwide.

Abdul Ghafar Mohammadi, a Taliban police commander, condemned the attack, calling it a "big crime." "We have ordered our fighters to arrest those behind the attack and bring them to justice," he said.

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan condemned the attack, reporting a death toll of 30. "This heinous attack targeting civilians at a place of worship is a serious violation of human rights and international humanitarian law," said a spokesperson for the mission.

The attack has sparked outrage and grief among Afghans, with many calling for increased security measures to protect civilians. "The government needs to do more to protect us. We cannot continue to live in fear of such attacks," said Murtaza Khaledi, an eyewitness.

The bombing comes at a time of increased violence in Afghanistan, with the Taliban facing pressure to maintain security and stability in the country. The attack highlights the ongoing challenges facing the country, including the presence of militant groups and the need for greater security measures to protect civilians.

In the wake of the attack, the Taliban has vowed to take action against those responsible and ensure the safety of civilians. However, the attack has raised concerns about the group's ability to control other militant groups and maintain security in the country.

The international community has also condemned the attack, calling for increased efforts to protect civilians and maintain peace and stability in Afghanistan. The attack serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges facing the country and the need for greater efforts to ensure the safety and security of all Afghans.
