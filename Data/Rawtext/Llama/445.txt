Royal Surprise in Harlem: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Visit Melba's Restaurant

In a heartwarming display of support for a Black, female-owned business, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry made a surprise visit to Melba's Harlem restaurant on Thursday. The visit came shortly after Meghan's book reading at PS 123, just a few blocks away.

Melba Wilson, the owner of Melba's, described the couple as "extremely gracious" and "down-to-earth" during their visit. Wilson was informed about the royal visit only an hour prior and was instructed not to close the restaurant for a private visit. Instead, the couple wanted to mingle with other customers and engage with staff and patrons.

"They were so approachable and genuinely cared about the people around them," Wilson said in an interview. "They wanted to make sure that everyone felt included and special. It was truly a positive experience for everyone in the restaurant."

The couple sampled various Southern staples and contemporary dishes from the restaurant's menu, including fried chicken, shrimp and grits, and cornbread. They also expressed a desire to support the local community, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To that end, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex donated $25,000 to Melba's COVID-19 Employee Relief Fund via the Archewell Foundation. Wilson emphasized the significance of the donation in supporting her employees and others facing food insecurity during the pandemic.

"The donation means everything to us," Wilson said. "It's helping us to continue to provide for our employees and the community, especially during these difficult times. We're so grateful for their support."

The visit is seen as a show of support not just for a Black, female-owned business but for the Harlem community and small communities in general. Wilson feels fulfilled by giving back and is inspired by the royal couple's visit and support.

"It's an honor to have them come to our restaurant and show their support," Wilson said. "It's a reminder that we're all in this together, and that we can make a difference in each other's lives. We're so grateful for their visit and their generosity."

The royal couple's visit has left a lasting positive impression on Wilson and the entire community. It serves as a reminder that even in the face of adversity, we can come together and support one another.

"We're thrilled to have had the opportunity to host Meghan and Harry at Melba's," Wilson said. "Their visit has brought so much joy and positivity to our community, and we're grateful for their support and generosity. We're inspired by their commitment to giving back and making a difference in the world."

In conclusion, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's visit to Melba's Harlem restaurant was a heartwarming display of support for a Black, female-owned business and the local community. Their approachability, genuine care, and generosity have left a lasting positive impression on everyone involved. The visit serves as a reminder that we can all make a difference in each other's lives, no matter who we are or where we come from.
