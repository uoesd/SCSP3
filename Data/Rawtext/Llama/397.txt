Why Derek Chauvin's Guilty Verdict Is Not Enough: The Illusion of Justice and the Need for Police Abolition

The recent guilty verdict of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd has sparked a mix of emotions. While many see it as a step towards accountability and justice, others, including former President Barack Obama and President Joe Biden, have rightly pointed out that it is not enough. The fact that a police officer was found guilty of killing an unarmed Black man is not a cause for celebration, but rather a reminder of the systemic failures that allow such tragedies to occur in the first place.

The belief that police reforms can solve racial bias is a dangerous illusion. Policing is fundamentally a system of racial and economic control, designed to maintain the status quo of power and privilege. Even without racial bias, policing won't solve the problems of inequality and exploitation. The conviction of Derek Chauvin does not address the root causes of police violence, which is embedded in the very fabric of our society.

Moreover, the low rate of police convictions despite numerous killings by police raises serious questions about the effectiveness of convictions in preventing future deaths. The same day that Chauvin was found guilty, a white police officer in Columbus, Ohio, shot and killed 15-year-old Black girl Ma'Khia Bryant. This tragic event serves as a stark reminder that police violence continues unabated, and that convictions provide relief only for the living, not for the victims who have been taken from us.

The recent police killings during the Chauvin trial illustrate the ongoing issues with police violence and the lack of justice for victims. The fact that police officers are given such broad leeway to use force under the law is a testament to the systemic problems that allow for such abuses of power. The celebration of Chauvin's conviction as justice is challenged by the reality that police violence continues to claim lives, and that convictions do not bring back the dead.

The time has come to recognize that police abolition, not just reform, is necessary for true societal change. We must support social movements and organizations pushing for police abolition and transformational change. The call for police abolition is not a call for chaos or lawlessness, but rather a call for a safer, more just society where communities are empowered to address their own needs and problems without the intervention of violent and oppressive forces.

In conclusion, the guilty verdict of Derek Chauvin is not enough. We must recognize that police violence is a symptom of a larger disease, and that convictions alone cannot cure it. The fight for justice and accountability is far from over, and it requires a commitment to dismantling the systems of oppression that have allowed for such tragedies to occur in the first place. The time for police abolition is now.
