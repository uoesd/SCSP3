White House Moves to Contain Fallout from Reports of Dysfunction in Vice President Harris' Office

The White House has been working to contain the fallout from reports of dysfunction and infighting in Vice President Kamala Harris' office, with sources close to her team expressing frustration over what they perceive as a dysfunctional operation with internal conflict, particularly aimed at Chief of Staff Tina Flournoy.

Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh emphasized Vice President Harris' focus on major administration agendas like the economy, racial equity, climate change, and the Covid-19 pandemic, saying, "The Vice President and her team are committed to delivering results for the American people, and that's what we're focused on."

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki highlighted Harris' importance as the President's partner and refrained from commenting further on the infighting reports, stating, "The Vice President is a vital member of the administration and a key partner to the President. We don't have any further comment on the internal workings of her office."

Conversations are happening at the West Wing on how to better support Harris' team amid concerns the narrative could affect her future, including a potential 2024 presidential run. Top White House officials and outside allies defend Harris and Flournoy, dismissing reports of infighting as overblown.

Chief of Staff Ron Klain praised Harris for her impactful work on immigration, vaccine equity, and economic opportunities for women, saying, "The Vice President has been a critical member of our team and has made a significant impact on some of the most pressing issues facing our country."

A pattern of stories on staff infighting and low morale has followed Harris from her Senate office to her presidential campaign and now to the vice presidency. Acknowledgment by Dunn of staff discontent on not being informed of Harris' trip to the southern border in advance, and the departure of Harris' top two advance officials, added to the chaotic narrative.

Despite the turmoil, there is a continued focus within the vice president's office on fulfilling its mission, with many experiencing high levels of stress and pressure. Singh emphasized that the team remains committed to delivering results for the American people, stating, "We're focused on the work, and we're going to keep doing what we came here to do."

The reports of dysfunction in Harris' office have sparked concerns about her future in the administration and her potential 2024 presidential aspirations. However, top White House officials and outside allies remain supportive of Harris and Flournoy, dismissing the reports as overblown and emphasizing the Vice President's importance to the administration.

In the midst of the chaos, the Vice President's office continues to push forward on key issues, with Harris recently announcing a new initiative to address the root causes of migration from Central America. The initiative, which aims to address poverty, violence, and corruption in the region, is seen as a key component of the administration's immigration policy.

As the White House works to contain the fallout from the reports of dysfunction, it remains to be seen how the narrative will impact Harris' future in the administration and her potential 2024 presidential aspirations. However, with the continued support of top White House officials and outside allies, Harris and her team remain focused on delivering results for the American people.
