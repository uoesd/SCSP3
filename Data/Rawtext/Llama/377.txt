Facebook and Google Under Fire for Failing to Remove Scam Ads, Despite User Reports

Facebook and Google, two of the world's largest tech giants, are facing intense criticism for their failure to effectively combat scam ads on their platforms, even after they have been reported by users. The issue has become particularly pressing in recent months, as online fraud has seen a significant increase due to lockdowns keeping people indoors globally.

According to a study by British consumer group Which?, 34% of Google-reported scam ads were not removed, and 26% for Facebook-reported ads. The study found that scammers are creating fake ads using established brands' logos and branding to steal financial details from consumers. Victims are more likely to come across fraudulent ads on Facebook than on Google.

Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which?, urges the UK government to take legislative action to tackle the problem of online scams. "The government needs to take responsibility for regulating these tech giants and ensure they are held accountable for not removing harmful content from their platforms," French said.

The proposed Online Safety Bill in the UK could impose fines on tech companies failing to remove 'harmful' content. The bill is currently being debated in parliament, and if passed, it could have significant implications for tech giants like Facebook and Google.

In response to the criticism, Facebook and Google have both released statements claiming that they proactively fight fraudulent activity and have removed scam ads from their platforms. A Facebook spokesperson said, "We take the issue of scam ads very seriously and have systems in place to detect and remove them. We also work closely with law enforcement to bring those responsible to justice."

A Google spokesperson echoed these sentiments, saying, "We are committed to protecting our users from fraudulent activity, and we have a number of measures in place to prevent and remove scam ads from our platform."

However, despite these assurances, the fact remains that scam ads continue to plague both platforms. Insider previously reported on scammers using fake quotes from celebrities to promote fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes on YouTube, which is owned by Google.

The issue of online fraud is not a new one, but the recent surge in scam ads on Facebook and Google has raised concerns about the tech giants' ability to effectively police their platforms. With the UK government considering legislative action, it remains to be seen how Facebook and Google will address the problem of online scams.

In the meantime, consumers are advised to be vigilant when clicking on ads online, and to be wary of any ads that ask for personal information or financial details. By taking these precautions, consumers can help protect themselves from falling victim to online fraud.

In conclusion, Facebook and Google's failure to effectively combat scam ads on their platforms is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. With the UK government considering legislative action, it is clear that the tech giants must take responsibility for regulating their platforms and ensuring that harmful content is removed. Until then, consumers must remain vigilant and take steps to protect themselves from online fraud.
