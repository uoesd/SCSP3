Deadly Explosion Rocks Kabul Mosque During Memorial Service

At least five civilians were killed and four others wounded in an explosion outside the Eid Gah Mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan, during a memorial service on Wednesday. The attack targeted the mother's memorial service of Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.

"It was a horrific scene, there were bodies and body parts everywhere," said Abdullah, a shopkeeper nearby the mosque. "I saw at least five people who were killed, including a woman and a child."

The explosion is the first attack in Kabul since late August, when an ISIS-K suicide bomber targeted American evacuation efforts. The attack underscores the growing security challenges faced by the Taliban, who have claimed to have brought peace and security to Afghanistan following their takeover in August.

"This attack is a stark reminder of the security challenges that Afghanistan continues to face," said Bilal Karimi, a Taliban spokesman. "We will not be deterred by such cowardly acts and will continue to work towards a peaceful and secure Afghanistan."

The Italian-funded emergency hospital in Kabul received four wounded individuals from the blast. "We have received four patients, including a child, who are in critical condition," said Marco Puntin, Country Director in Afghanistan for Emergency. "We are doing everything we can to save their lives."

Taliban fighters were not harmed in the attack, and three suspects have been arrested following the explosion. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but ISIL-affiliated fighters' attacks have increased since the Taliban takeover.

The explosion is seen as undermining the Taliban's claim of enhanced security in Afghanistan. ISKP has been increasing its attacks against the Taliban and expanding its presence closer to Kabul. The attack reflects the broader context of security and economic challenges facing Afghanistan under Taliban rule.

The Taliban have been facing growing pressure from the international community to ensure security and stability in Afghanistan. The attack highlights the challenges the group faces in maintaining security, particularly in the capital city of Kabul.

The explosion also raises concerns about the growing presence of ISKP in Afghanistan. The group has been responsible for several high-profile attacks in recent months, including a suicide bombing at a wedding in Kabul that killed at least 63 people.

The attack comes at a time when the Taliban are facing economic challenges, with the country's economy struggling to recover from years of conflict. The group has been working to rebuild infrastructure and attract foreign investment, but progress has been slow.

The explosion outside the Eid Gah Mosque is a reminder of the ongoing security challenges facing Afghanistan. The attack highlights the need for the Taliban to take action to ensure security and stability in the country, particularly in the capital city of Kabul.

The attack also underscores the growing threat posed by ISKP in Afghanistan. The group has been expanding its presence and carrying out high-profile attacks, posing a significant challenge to the Taliban's efforts to maintain security.

The international community is closely watching the situation in Afghanistan, with many countries calling for the Taliban to ensure security and stability in the country. The attack outside the Eid Gah Mosque highlights the need for the Taliban to take action to address the growing security challenges facing Afghanistan.

In conclusion, the explosion outside the Eid Gah Mosque in Kabul is a tragic reminder of the ongoing security challenges facing Afghanistan. The attack highlights the need for the Taliban to take action to ensure security and stability in the country, particularly in the capital city of Kabul. The growing presence of ISKP in Afghanistan poses a significant challenge to the Taliban's efforts to maintain security, and the international community is closely watching the situation.
