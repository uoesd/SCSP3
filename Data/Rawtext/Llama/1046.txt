Winter Storm Claims First Lives in Austin, Fire Officials Warn of Heating Dangers

Austin, TX - Tragedy struck East Austin early Thursday morning as a house fire claimed two lives and left others injured, marking the first fatalities in the Austin area related to the ongoing winter storm. The blaze, which is believed to have been sparked by an indoor warming fire, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unsafe heating methods during power outages.

"It's a tragic reminder of the risks associated with alternative heating sources," said Stephen Truesdell, Division Chief of the Austin Fire Department. "We urge everyone to exercise extreme caution and avoid using charcoal barbecues or gas grills indoors, as they can lead to fires and carbon monoxide poisoning."

The Austin Fire Department responded to the call at around 1:30 AM, after a passerby reported the fire on East 12th Street. Firefighters arrived to find five people still inside the home, which was without power at the time of the fire. The house has been deemed a total loss.

"It's heartbreaking to see lives lost in such a preventable tragedy," said Darren Noak, Captain of Austin-Travis County EMS. "We've seen a surge in emergency calls since the start of the severe winter weather, and we urge everyone to take the necessary precautions to stay safe."

No fatalities have been directly linked to the winter storm itself, but emergency services have responded to numerous related calls. The Austin-Travis County EMS has received thousands of emergency calls since the onset of the severe weather, according to Captain Noak.

Rumors of deaths related to the cold have circulated, but EMS and fire officials have emphasized that the determination of cause of death falls to medical examiners.

Nationwide, more than two dozen people have died due to the extreme weather, including incidents involving carbon monoxide poisoning and hypothermia.

In response to the ongoing power outages, local leaders have opened more cold weather shelters for vulnerable residents. Nearly 183,000 Austin Energy customers remained without power as of Thursday morning.

The Austin Fire Department and Austin-Travis County EMS urge residents to take the following precautions to stay safe during the winter storm:

  • Use flashlights instead of candles to avoid fire hazards.
  • Keep alternative heating sources at least three feet away from flammable materials.
  • Never use charcoal barbecues or gas grills indoors.
  • Keep carbon monoxide detectors in working order.
  • Stay informed about weather conditions and power outages.

The community is coming together to support those affected by the fire. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the families who lost their homes and loved ones.

As the winter storm continues to impact the Austin area, residents are reminded to prioritize their safety and the safety of those around them. The Austin Fire Department and Austin-Travis County EMS will continue to work tirelessly to respond to emergency calls and keep the community safe.

In the wake of this tragedy, it is clear that the winter storm has already had a devastating impact on the Austin area. As the community works to recover and rebuild, it is crucial that residents take the necessary precautions to prevent further loss of life.
