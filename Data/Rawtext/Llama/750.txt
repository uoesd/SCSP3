"Rust" Assistant Director Dave Halls Faced Safety Complaints and Allegations of Inappropriate Behavior on Set

CNN – Albuquerque, New Mexico – New allegations have surfaced against Dave Halls, the assistant director on the film "Rust," who handed Alec Baldwin a prop firearm that led to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Halls faced complaints over safety protocols, blocked fire lanes and exits, and inappropriate sexual behavior during 2019 productions.

Maggie Goll, a prop maker and licensed pyrotechnician who worked with Halls on several productions, cited instances of Halls neglecting to hold safety meetings and announce the presence of a firearm on set. "Dave Halls was the assistant director on set, and he was responsible for ensuring safety protocols were followed," Goll said in an interview with CNN. "But he consistently failed to do so."

Goll accused Halls of failing to conduct proper safety protocols, including announcing the type of weapons used and ensuring their safe handling. "There were several instances where he didn't follow proper safety procedures, and it made me and other crew members uncomfortable," Goll said.

A licensed pyrotechnician had a medical emergency on set, and Halls allegedly asked to continue shooting, disregarding safety concerns. "It was clear that he was more interested in getting the shot than ensuring the safety of the crew," Goll said.

A crew member corroborated Goll's account, saying Halls was dismissive during safety meetings and reluctant to have guns inspected. "He would often roll his eyes or make jokes when we brought up safety concerns," the crew member said. "It was like he didn't take our jobs seriously."

Halls also insisted on filming during unsafe weather conditions, raising crew members' safety fears. "He would push to keep filming even when the weather was dangerous, and it made us feel like he didn't care about our safety," the crew member said.

Allegations of sexual misconduct were also reported against Halls for being too physically familiar with the crew. "He would often touch people inappropriately or make suggestive comments," Goll said. "It was uncomfortable and inappropriate."

Goll reported Halls' behavior internally and to the Directors Guild of America, but claims no action was taken. "I'm not sure if it's because he's a powerful figure in the industry, but it's frustrating that nothing was done," Goll said.

The allegations against Halls come as the film industry reels from the death of Halyna Hutchins, who was killed when Alec Baldwin was handed a prop firearm that was not properly checked. The incident has raised questions about safety protocols on film sets and the responsibility of assistant directors to ensure crew safety.

Halls' behavior has also sparked concerns about the prevalence of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior in the film industry. "It's not just about safety protocols, it's about creating a safe and respectful work environment," Goll said. "No one should have to tolerate inappropriate behavior on set."

The allegations against Halls are part of a larger conversation about safety and accountability in the film industry. "It's time for change," Goll said. "We need to hold people in positions of power accountable for their actions and ensure that crew members feel safe and respected on set."

In the wake of Hutchins' death, the film industry has come under scrutiny for its safety protocols and culture. The incident has sparked calls for better safety measures and greater accountability on set.

As the investigation into Hutchins' death continues, the allegations against Halls have raised questions about the role of assistant directors in ensuring crew safety. "Assistant directors are responsible for ensuring that safety protocols are followed, and they need to be held accountable when they fail to do so," Goll said.

The incident has also highlighted the need for better training and education on set. "Crew members need to be trained on proper safety procedures, and they need to be empowered to speak up when they see something unsafe," Goll said.

As the film industry grapples with the fallout from Hutchins' death, it's clear that change is needed. "It's time for a culture shift in the film industry," Goll said. "We need to prioritize safety and respect on set, and we need to hold people in positions of power accountable for their actions."

In conclusion, the allegations against Dave Halls highlight a larger problem in the film industry – a lack of accountability and a culture that prioritizes production over safety. It's time for change, and it's time for crew members to feel safe and respected on set.
