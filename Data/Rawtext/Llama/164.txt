The Tragic Twist that Shook 'Mare of Easttown': Evan Peters on the Emotional Impact of Detective Colin Zabel's Death

In a shocking turn of events, Detective Colin Zabel, played by Evan Peters, met an untimely demise in episode five of HBO's hit series "Mare of Easttown." The unexpected twist left audiences reeling, and according to Peters and series director Craig Zobel, that was exactly the intention.

In an interview on the podcast Still Watching: Mare of Easttown, Peters revealed that he and Zobel were determined to elicit a strong emotional response from viewers with Zabel's death. "We wanted to make it hurt," Peters said. "We wanted to make it feel like a punch in the gut."

Peters' preparation for the role included exploring new aspects of his character right up until his last day of shooting, which made Zabel's death all the more poignant. "I was still learning things about him, even on the last day," Peters shared. "It was a constant evolution."

Series creator Brad Ingelsby originally envisioned Colin Zabel as a confident, somewhat cocky detective. This vision was reflected in the character's costume design by Meghan Kasperlik. However, as the series progressed, Zabel's portrayal shifted to that of an earnest young man grappling with imposter syndrome.

Peters related more to the character's insecurity and imposter syndrome than to the initial concept of overconfidence. He even took pool lessons for the role, which ultimately did not play a significant part in the character's development.

Zabel's character development included a backstory where he takes credit for a case he didn't solve, intensifying his internal struggles. According to Peters, this aspect of Zabel's character made his death all the more tragic. "He was already struggling with imposter syndrome, and then he takes credit for something he didn't do," Peters said. "It's just a snowball effect of insecurity and self-doubt."

For costume designer Meghan Kasperlik, Zabel's transformation from a confident detective to a more vulnerable character was a challenge. "It was interesting to see how his character evolved over time," Kasperlik said. "We had to adjust his costumes to reflect that."

In the end, the impact of Detective Colin Zabel's death in "Mare of Easttown" was felt not only by audiences but also by the actors and creators involved in the series. As Peters put it, "We wanted to make it hurt, and I think we succeeded."
