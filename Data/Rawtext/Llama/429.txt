Derek Chauvin Found Guilty of Murder in Death of George Floyd

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – A jury has found former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. The verdict, delivered after three weeks of testimony and 10 hours of jury deliberations over two days, has triggered worldwide protests and a reexamination of racism and policing in the U.S.

"Today, we have seen justice prevail," said President Joe Biden in a statement. "The jury's verdict is a step towards justice and systemic reform. It's a reminder that we must continue to work towards a society where everyone is treated with dignity and respect."

Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for more than 90 seconds while arresting him. Floyd's death was captured on bystander video, which prosecutors relied heavily on, urging the jury to "Believe your eyes."

Chauvin's defense argued that his actions were reasonable and that Floyd's death was due to health issues and drug use. Chauvin did not testify, and his attorney Eric Nelson did not comment following the verdict.

Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's younger brother, expressed relief and gratitude following the verdict. "We're finally getting the justice that my brother deserved," he said. "I'm just happy that the jury saw the truth and did the right thing."

Sarah Fitzgerald, a spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections, confirmed that Chauvin was taken into custody immediately after the verdict was read. He is being held at the Hennepin County Jail until his sentencing, which has not yet been scheduled.

The case has highlighted the rare occurrence of police officers being convicted for on-duty killings. According to data collected by the Washington Post, only 11 police officers have been convicted of murder or manslaughter in the U.S. since 2015.

Floyd's death led to widespread protests across the U.S. and around the world, with demonstrators calling for justice and reforms in policing practices. In the aftermath of Floyd's death, many cities implemented reforms such as banning chokeholds and requiring officers to intervene when they witness excessive force.

The Justice Department announced an investigation into Minneapolis policing practices following the verdict. "The Justice Department is committed to ensuring that all individuals, regardless of race, have equal access to justice and are treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement," said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement.

The jury's decision has also sparked renewed calls for police reform. "This verdict is a step in the right direction, but there is still much work to be done," said Janay Henry, a witness who testified during the trial. "We need to continue to hold police accountable and ensure that they are serving and protecting all communities, not just those who look like them."

Jamee Haggard, another witness, echoed Henry's sentiments. "We can't let this verdict be a one-time thing," she said. "We need to keep pushing for change and making sure that police are held accountable for their actions."

The verdict has also sparked a renewed focus on addressing systemic racism in the U.S. "The killing of George Floyd is a symptom of a larger problem," said President Biden. "We must continue to confront the systemic racism that perpetuates violence and discrimination against people of color."

In the aftermath of Floyd's death, many cities removed Confederate statues and other symbols of racism. The verdict has reignited calls for further action. "We need to continue to dismantle the systems of oppression that have allowed racism to flourish," said Philonise Floyd. "We can't stop now. We have to keep pushing forward."

The verdict has also sparked a renewed focus on community policing. "We need to build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve," said Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis. "We must work towards a future where everyone feels safe and valued."

As the nation grapples with the implications of the verdict, one thing is clear: the death of George Floyd has sparked a movement for change. "We will continue to fight for justice and equality," said Philonise Floyd. "My brother's death will not be in vain."
