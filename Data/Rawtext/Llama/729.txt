Clergy Comfort Community After Tragic Oxford High School Shooting

The community of Oxford, Michigan, was left reeling after a tragic shooting at Oxford High School took the lives of three students and wounded eight others. In the aftermath of the tragedy, the clergy at St. Joseph Catholic Church stepped forward to offer spiritual and emotional support to the grieving community.

Father Jim Kean, pastor of St. Joseph, and Father John Carlin, associate pastor, were among the first to respond to the call for help. They quickly organized a Mass dedicated to healing, which was held at the church just hours after the shooting.

"We wanted to provide a space for the community to come together and share their grief," said Father Kean. "We knew that people needed a place to process their emotions and find comfort in this time of tragedy."

The Mass was attended by hundreds of community members, including students, parents, and faculty from Oxford High School. John Wurges, an attendee at the Mass, expressed his gratitude for the support of the clergy.

"It's times like these that we need to come together as a community and support each other," said Wurges. "The clergy at St. Joseph have been a source of comfort and strength for us all."

Father Carlin delivered a powerful homily during the Mass, addressing the pain and suffering that the community was experiencing.

"We are here today to mourn the loss of three young lives and to pray for the healing of those who were wounded," said Father Carlin. "We are also here to support each other, to hold each other up in this time of sorrow."

Detroit Archbishop Allen H. Vigneron also expressed his heartbreak over the shooting, offering prayers for the victims and their families.

"I am deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at Oxford High School," said Archbishop Vigneron. "I offer my prayers and condolences to the families of the victims and to the entire community. May God grant us all peace and healing in this time of sorrow."

The shooting at Oxford High School is considered the worst school shooting in Michigan's history. The suspect, a 15-year-old Oxford High sophomore, fired 15 to 20 rounds from a semiautomatic handgun before surrendering. Three students were killed, and eight others were wounded, with three in critical condition.

Gage Harris, an alumnus of St. Joseph School, was deeply affected by the shooting. He knew some of the victims personally and attended the Mass to offer his support to their families.

"I couldn't believe it when I heard the news," said Harris. "I knew some of the kids who were killed. It's just heartbreaking. I wanted to come to the Mass to show my support for their families and to pray for healing."

The Mass at St. Joseph Catholic Church was a time for community members to come together, share their grief, and offer each other support. Even non-Catholics attended the Mass, reflecting the community's solidarity in the face of tragedy.

"This is not just a Catholic issue, it's a community issue," said Father Kean. "We wanted to open our doors to everyone, regardless of their faith. We are all in this together."

As the community of Oxford begins the long healing process, the clergy at St. Joseph Catholic Church will continue to play a vital role in supporting and comforting those affected by the tragedy.

"We will be here for as long as the community needs us," said Father Carlin. "We will continue to offer our support and our prayers for healing and peace."
