Afghan Dual Nationals Leave Kabul as U.S. and Taliban Cooperate on Departures

Scores of Afghan dual nationals, including Americans and citizens of other Western countries, have left Kabul via a newly reopened airport, marking a significant development in the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan. The departures were facilitated by the U.S. and the Taliban, who showed flexibility and professionalism in allowing the evacuations.

According to U.S. Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. has been working closely with the Taliban to ensure the safe departure of its citizens and lawful permanent residents. "We are grateful for the cooperation of the Taliban in facilitating the departure of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents from Afghanistan," Khalilzad said in a statement.

National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne echoed Khalilzad's sentiments, stating that the U.S. had facilitated the departure of its citizens and lawful permanent residents. "The United States is committed to ensuring the safety and security of its citizens and lawful permanent residents, and we are working closely with the Taliban to ensure their safe departure from Afghanistan," Horne said.

The Taliban, who had previously been restrictive in allowing departures, have shown a willingness to cooperate with the U.S. and other countries in recent days. Qari Yousef Ahmadi, a spokesman for the Taliban, stated that the group was committed to ensuring the safety of all Afghans and foreign nationals in the country. "We are working closely with the international community to ensure the safe departure of all those who wish to leave Afghanistan," Ahmadi said.

The development comes as Kabul airport, which was previously damaged in the conflict, has been repaired and is now nearly fully operational. Qatari special envoy Mutlaq al-Qahtani announced that the airport was ready to receive flights, emphasizing the transition from "evacuation" to normal travel for those with valid documents.

However, not all Afghans have been able to leave the country. Planes in Mazar-e Sharif meant to evacuate at-risk Afghans have been unable to leave due to Taliban restrictions and technical issues. The U.S. has been working to address these issues and ensure the safe departure of all those who wish to leave.

The situation in Afghanistan remains complex, with the Taliban announcing an interim government and cracking down on protests. The U.S. has expressed concerns over the Taliban's promises on government formation and treatment of protesters and journalists. Former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who fled the country, has denied fleeing with millions and is open to a U.N. investigation.

International reactions to the situation in Afghanistan vary, with some countries expressing support for the U.S. and others calling for caution. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated that the U.S. would continue to work with the Taliban to ensure the safe departure of all those who wish to leave. "We are committed to ensuring the safety and security of all Afghans and foreign nationals in Afghanistan," Austin said.

As the situation in Afghanistan continues to evolve, the U.S. and the Taliban are working together to ensure the safe departure of all those who wish to leave. While challenges remain, the cooperation between the two sides is a positive development in the ongoing crisis.
