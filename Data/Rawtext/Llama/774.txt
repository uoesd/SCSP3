Dwayne Johnson's Production Company to Stop Using Real Guns After Rust Movie Set Tragedy

In the wake of the tragic shooting on the set of the movie Rust, which resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, Dwayne Johnson has announced that his production company, Seven Bucks Productions, will no longer use real guns in any of its future projects.

In a statement, Johnson expressed his heartbreak over the incident and his sympathy for Hutchins' family and the Rust set members. He also vowed to implement a "no real guns" rule in any project his company is involved in, regardless of the cost.

"We're going to take a stand and make a change," Johnson said. "We're not going to use real guns in any of our productions anymore. We're going to use rubber guns, and we're going to make sure that everyone on set knows that they're not real."

The decision comes after actor Alec Baldwin discharged a prop gun on the set of Rust, which resulted in Hutchins' death and injured director Joel Souza. The incident is still under investigation.

Baldwin referred to Hutchins' death as a "tragic accident" and expressed his heartbreak over the incident. "My heart goes out to Halyna Hutchins' family and the Rust set members," he said. "I'm fully cooperating with the investigation, and I'm committed to doing everything I can to ensure that something like this never happens again."

Johnson's remarks were made ahead of the release of his new Netflix action film, Red Notice. He encouraged other production companies to follow suit and adopt the "no real guns" rule.

"I know it's not going to be easy, and it's not going to be cheap," Johnson said. "But we have to do what's right. We have to make sure that everyone on set is safe, and that we're not putting anyone in harm's way."

Eric Kripke, showrunner of Amazon's The Boys, also committed to not using real guns and encouraged others to do the same. "We're not going to use real guns on The Boys anymore," Kripke said. "We're going to use rubber guns, and we're going to make sure that everyone on set knows that they're not real."

The Rust movie set tragedy has sparked a conversation about gun safety on set, with many calling for stricter regulations and better safety protocols. Johnson's announcement is seen as a positive step towards creating a safer environment for cast and crew members.

In conclusion, Dwayne Johnson's decision to stop using real guns in his production company's projects is a welcome move towards creating a safer environment for everyone involved in filmmaking. It's a reminder that safety should always come first, and that the use of real guns on set is not worth the risk.
