Rep. Michael Guest Shares Perspective on Election, Insurrection, and Impeachment

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) – Republican Representative Michael Guest sat down with WLBT to discuss his views on the recent events that have shaken the nation's capital, including the election, Capitol insurrection, and impeachment.

Guest acknowledged that the past three months have been unprecedented in modern U.S. history. "We've never seen anything like this before," he said. "It's been a challenging time for our country, and it's been a challenging time for Congress."

When asked about voter irregularities, Guest noted that while they did occur, he did not believe they were significant enough to overturn the election results. "I think it's important to recognize that there were some issues with the election, but I don't think those issues were widespread enough to change the outcome," he said.

Guest did, however, challenge the certification of election results in two states, citing violations of legislative will, not widespread fraud. "I think it's important to ensure that the will of the people is respected, and that the rules of the election are followed," he explained.

Guest was present at the Capitol during the insurrection and described the experience of being locked in the House chamber. "It was a frightening experience, to be honest," he said. "But I'm proud of the way that Congress came together to continue doing the people's work."

Guest believes that there is shared blame for the Capitol insurrection, and that it's not solely the responsibility of President Trump. "I think it's important to recognize that there were many factors that contributed to the insurrection, and that we all have a role to play in preventing something like this from happening again in the future," he said.

Regarding Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Guest disagrees with many statements she has made, but opposes using those to remove her from committees. "I think it's important to allow people to have their opinions, even if we disagree with them," he said. "But I do support a proposal to remove her from the Education and Labor Committee while allowing her to remain on the Budget Committee."

The conversation with Guest highlights the challenges and controversies facing Congress in light of recent political events. "It's a difficult time for our country, and it's a difficult time for Congress," Guest said. "But I'm committed to working with my colleagues to find solutions to the challenges we face, and to ensure that the will of the people is respected."
