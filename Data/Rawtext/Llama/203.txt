"Biden's Gas Crisis"? Conservatives Mislead on Fuel Shortage Cause

A cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, not President Joe Biden's policies, has caused a fuel supply crunch on the East Coast, but that hasn't stopped conservatives from misleadingly blaming the president for the shortage.

Biden sought to reassure the public that the situation was temporary and urged against panic buying, but that didn't stop misleading narratives from spreading on social media and conservative commentary.

"We're going to get through this, folks," Biden said. "It's a temporary situation. Don't panic. Don't engage in price gouging."

Former President Donald Trump and other prominent conservatives have attributed a list of national crises to Biden, including the fuel crisis.

"The Biden Administration is a complete disaster," Trump said in a statement. "The gas shortage is just the latest example of their incompetence."

U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican from Colorado, took to Twitter to blame Biden for the shortage, saying, "Joe Biden's energy policies are causing a gas crisis on the East Coast. #BidensGasCrisis"

Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren also jumped on the bandwagon, tweeting, "Biden's gas crisis is just the latest example of how the left's policies are destroying our country."

But the actual cause of the fuel shortage was a cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, which supplies gasoline and diesel fuel to the East Coast. The attack forced the pipeline to shut down, leading to a supply crunch and rising prices.

Chuck Callesto, a former Florida congressional candidate, took to Twitter to spread misinformation about the cause of the shortage, saying, "Biden's Keystone XL pipeline cancellation is directly responsible for the gas shortage on the East Coast. #BidensGasCrisis"

However, the Keystone XL pipeline project would have had no impact on the current gas shortage, as it was designed to transport oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast, not the East Coast.

The Biden administration is facing multiple challenges, including a disappointing jobs report, inflation signs, violence in Israel, and efforts to manage COVID-19. The gas pipeline shutdown exacerbates public relations challenges for Biden, amidst rising gas prices as COVID-19 restrictions are loosened.

Republican strategist Doug Heye saw the situation as an opportunity for conservatives to push their message, amidst other Republican divisions.

"The gas crisis provides a perfect opportunity for Republicans to highlight the failures of the Biden administration," Heye said. "It's a reminder of the consequences of electing a president who is out of touch with the needs of the American people."

Despite the facts, the narrative of Biden being responsible for the gas crisis gained momentum through social media and conservative commentary.

Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity even went so far as to compare the situation to the 1979 fuel shortage under President Carter, saying, "Joe Biden's gas crisis is just like Jimmy Carter's, but worse. #BidensGasCrisis"

However, the comparison is unfair, as the 1979 fuel shortage was caused by a global oil embargo, not a cyberattack on a pipeline.

In conclusion, the fuel supply crunch on the East Coast is a temporary situation caused by a cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, not President Biden's policies or executive orders. Despite the facts, conservatives have misleadingly blamed Biden for the shortage, using it as an opportunity to push their message and compare the situation to past crises.
