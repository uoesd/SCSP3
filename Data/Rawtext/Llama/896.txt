Brady Still Haunted by Super Bowl Loss to Eagles, but Breaks NFL Record

Tom Brady, the legendary quarterback now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, can't seem to shake off the memory of the New England Patriots' loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII. In a recent interview, Brady jokingly mentioned his inability to catch a pass during the game, referencing a dropped pass in a trick play. "I'm still working on my receiving skills, I guess," he chuckled.

The loss to the Eagles and its impact were highlighted in the Facebook documentary series 'Tom vs. Time', which gave viewers a behind-the-scenes look at Brady's life and career. Brady has openly discussed the mental scars from the Super Bowl loss, indicating he's not yet over it. "It's a tough game to move on from," he said. "It's a game that I'll always remember, unfortunately."

Brady's recent achievement of breaking the NFL all-time passing yards record, previously held by Drew Brees, has done little to ease the sting of that loss. "It's a great accomplishment, but it doesn't erase the memories of that game," he said.

The Buccaneers' recent victory over the Patriots drew about 27.2 million viewers, marking a high for Sunday Night Football since 2015. The game between Brady and his former coach, Bill Belichick, garnered significant attention and a 34% household share. "It was a highly anticipated matchup, and the viewership numbers show that," said Michelle Tafoya, reporter for NBC Sunday Night Football.

Despite high viewer numbers, the game did not break into the top five regular-season broadcasts of all time. "It's a testament to the enduring popularity of Tom Brady and the NFL," said Jon Lewis, writer for Sports Media Watch.

In other NFL news, former tight end Greg Olsen and play-by-play announcer Joe Davis will call the upcoming Eagles vs. Panthers game. Olsen, who played for the Panthers from 2011 to 2019, is excited to return to his old stomping grounds. "I'm looking forward to being back in Charlotte and calling a game with my good friend Joe Davis," he said.

Meanwhile, Eli Manning, the former New York Giants quarterback, humorously interacted with fans on Twitter, regarding the absence of the Manning brothers' alternate Monday Night Football broadcast. "Hey @EliManning, where's the Manningcast?" asked one fan. "I'm on a secret mission with @PeytonManning," Eli replied. "We'll be back soon, stay tuned."

In conclusion, Tom Brady's legacy continues to be shaped by his time with the New England Patriots, including the memorable loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII. Despite his achievements and successes, the loss still weighs heavily on his mind. However, as he continues to break records and make headlines, it's clear that Brady is still a force to be reckoned with in the NFL.
