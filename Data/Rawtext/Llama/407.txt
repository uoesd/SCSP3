Expert witness testimony divides opinions in Derek Chauvin trial

CNN – The trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin continued this week, with the defense and prosecution presenting contrasting views on Chauvin's use of force against George Floyd. The defense argued that Chauvin's actions were appropriate and that Floyd's death was due to drug and health problems, while the prosecution emphasized that Chauvin's excessive force led to Floyd's death.

On Monday, use-of-force expert Barry Brodd testified for the defense, stating that Chauvin was justified in kneeling on Floyd and did not use deadly force. Brodd argued that the "prone control" position was not a use of force because, in his view, it does not cause pain.

However, during cross-examination, Brodd admitted that Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck, as shown in a photo, could be considered a use of force. Brodd's testimony contradicted other policing experts and Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who criticized Chauvin's actions.

Prosecutor Steve Schleicher asked Brodd, "You're aware that Chief Arradondo has criticized the use of the prone control position in this case, aren't you?" Brodd replied, "Yes, I am." Schleicher continued, "And you're aware that he's said that it's not a trained technique in the Minneapolis Police Department, correct?" Brodd again replied, "Yes, I am."

The defense also highlighted Floyd's 2019 arrest and drug use to argue his death was due to health issues. Retired Minneapolis Police officer Scott Creighton and retired paramedic Michelle Moseng testified about Floyd's 2019 arrest. Shawanda Hill, Floyd's friend, testified about Floyd's state shortly before his arrest on May 25, 2020.

Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother, emotionally testified about his brother's character and their relationship. "My brother was a gentle giant," Philonise Floyd said. "He had a way of making you feel like you were the only person in the room."

The prosecution rested its case after calling 38 witnesses over 11 days, focusing on Chauvin's excessive and unreasonable force. The defense is expected to continue presenting its case this week.

Brodd's testimony sparked controversy, with some arguing that his views are out of touch with modern policing practices. "The idea that the prone control position isn't a use of force is just not supported by the evidence," said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer and law professor. "It's a position that can be used to control someone, but it's not a position that should be used to punish or harm someone."

The trial has reignited discussions about police brutality and systemic racism in the criminal justice system. Protesters have gathered outside the courthouse, calling for justice for George Floyd and an end to police violence.

In a statement, the Floyd family's attorney, Ben Crump, said, "The Floyd family is grateful for the prosecution's efforts to hold Derek Chauvin accountable for his actions. George Floyd's death was a tragedy that should never have happened, and it's important that we continue to shine a light on the systemic issues that led to his death."

The trial is expected to continue for several more weeks, with the defense presenting its case and the prosecution responding. The outcome of the trial could have significant implications for policing practices and community-police relations in Minneapolis and beyond.
