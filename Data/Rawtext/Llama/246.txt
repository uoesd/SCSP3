Biden Administration Unveils Sweeping COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates for Employers, Federal Contractors, and Federal Workers

In a bold move to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, President Joe Biden has announced a series of vaccine mandates for U.S. employers with 100+ employees, federal contractors, and federal workers. The mandates, which were unveiled on September 9, 2022, are aimed at protecting workers, reducing the spread of the virus, and helping to stabilize the economy.

Under the new rules, employers with 100+ employees will be required to ensure that their workers are fully vaccinated or undergo weekly COVID-19 testing. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will develop an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to enforce this requirement, which will not require a notice-and-comment process and will have immediate effect upon publication.

In addition to the vaccination requirement, employers must provide paid time off for employees to get vaccinated and recover from any side effects. This provision is intended to encourage workers to get vaccinated and minimize the risk of transmission in the workplace.

The vaccine mandate for federal contractors is equally strict, with all employees of federal contractors required to be fully vaccinated by September 24, 2022. The Safer Federal Workforce Task Force will provide detailed guidance on how federal contractors must comply with the mandate.

Legal challenges to the vaccine mandates are anticipated, particularly concerning the rule's wage-payment requirement and coverage of workers who recently recovered from COVID-19. However, the Biden Administration is confident that the mandates are necessary to protect public health and will withstand legal scrutiny.

Separate executive orders mandate vaccinations for all federal workers and employees of federal contractors, with minimal exceptions. Federal contractors must comply with the vaccine mandate as detailed by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, while all federal executive branch workers are required to be vaccinated, with only legally required exceptions permitted.

The vaccine mandates are not limited to federal workers and contractors. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will also require COVID-19 vaccinations for workers in most health care settings that receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. This move is aimed at protecting vulnerable populations and reducing the risk of transmission in health care settings.

The Biden Administration's vaccine mandates mark a significant escalation in the fight against COVID-19. By requiring vaccination or testing for millions of workers, the Administration hopes to slow the spread of the virus, protect public health, and stabilize the economy. While legal challenges are likely, the Administration is confident that the mandates are necessary and will withstand scrutiny. As the pandemic continues to rage, the vaccine mandates represent a bold step towards a safer, healthier future for all Americans.
