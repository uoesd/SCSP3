Republicans Falsely Blame Biden for Rising Gas Prices, Lumber Costs

WASHINGTON (AP) – House Republican leaders are incorrectly blaming President Joe Biden for the recent increase in gasoline and lumber costs, citing his policies as the reason for the hike. However, a closer examination of the facts reveals that the rise in prices is largely due to factors beyond the president's control.

Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, accused Biden of causing the increase in gas prices, stating that "the president's policies have caused the price of gasoline to skyrocket." Liz Cheney, a Republican representative from Wyoming, also jumped on the bandwagon, claiming that Biden's actions on the Keystone XL pipeline have led to higher gas prices. Ronna McDaniel, the head of the Republican National Committee, echoed these sentiments, saying that Biden's policies are responsible for a 400% increase in lumber prices.

However, experts disagree with these assertions. Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at Gas Buddy, attributes the recent increase in gas prices to the cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, which caused a shutdown of the pipeline and led to a rapid bounce-back in demand. "The recent increase in gas prices is not due to President Biden's policies, but rather the result of a perfect storm of factors, including the Colonial Pipeline shutdown and strong demand," DeHaan said.

It's important to note that the Keystone XL pipeline, which Biden revoked the permit for, carries crude oil, not gasoline. Therefore, any claims connecting Biden's actions on the pipeline to the current gasoline prices are misleading.

Moreover, comparing gas prices now to last year's prices is misleading, as prices plummeted in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, not because of Trump administration policies. Despite the pipeline being back in operation, some states are still experiencing gas shortages due to the cyberattack.

Lumber prices have indeed surged, but this is largely due to increased demand and a sharp economic rebound, not Biden's policies. In fact, experts say that rising prices in commodities like lumber are a positive sign for the economy, indicating strong consumer demand for goods.

In conclusion, the claims made by House Republican leaders that President Biden is responsible for the rise in gasoline and lumber costs are unfounded. The recent increase in prices is mainly due to the difficulties of restarting the U.S. and global economies post-pandemic, as well as the cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline. It's important to be aware of the facts and not make misleading connections between policies and price increases.
