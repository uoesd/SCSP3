Shooting in Jackson Leaves One Dead, Three More Found Dead Overnight; Mississippi Supreme Court Makes Changes to Judicial Race Oversight

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) – A shooting in Jackson on Saturday night has left one person dead, and three more were found dead from gunshot wounds early Sunday morning. The incidents come as the Mississippi Supreme Court makes changes to the oversight of judicial races, aiming to address the influence of money in elections but reducing public information on unethical conduct.

According to Deputy Chief Deric Hearn of the Jackson Police Department, the shooting occurred around 10:30 p.m. Saturday, resulting in the death of Antoinette Robinson. Hearn stated that officers responded to a call about a shooting on Bailey Avenue and found Robinson suffering from a gunshot wound. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Spokesperson Sam Brown of the Jackson Police Department confirmed that three more people were found dead from gunshot wounds around 12:30 a.m. Sunday on Britton Street, Jackson. The identities of the victims have not been released, and the investigation is ongoing.

In a separate development, the Mississippi Supreme Court has made changes affecting the transparency of findings of unethical behavior during judicial campaigns. Previously, a five-person committee monitored judicial races for a single election year, but now, a nine-person committee will serve multiple years. The changes aim to address the influence of money in elections but reduce public information on unethical conduct.

Judicial candidates in Mississippi are restricted in their campaign promises by the Code of Judicial Conduct. The code prohibits candidates from making promises that could compromise their impartiality or independence.

In a related development, Ethan Crumbley, a 15-year-old charged as an adult with murder and terrorism for the shooting at Oxford High School, Michigan, was due in court for a procedural hearing. The shooting at Oxford High School resulted in four students killed and seven others wounded. Crumbley's significant hearing is scheduled for Dec. 20 to decide on a trial. However, the potential for a mental competency exam for Crumbley could put the case on hold.

In conclusion, the shooting incidents in Jackson and the changes in Mississippi judicial race oversight highlight the need for increased vigilance and transparency in ensuring public safety and ethical conduct in the judicial system.
