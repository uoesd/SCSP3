Ida's Fury: Louisiana Reels from Category 4 Hurricane

NEW ORLEANS (AP) – Hurricane Ida slammed into Louisiana as a powerful Category 4 storm, leaving a trail of destruction and widespread power outages in its wake. The storm made landfall on the 16-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, sharing a similar path and heightening concerns over flooding and critical infrastructure damage.

Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office reported on Facebook that a person was killed due to a fallen tree on a home in Prairieville. The storm's fury was evident in the widespread power outages, with all of New Orleans losing electricity. More than 1 million customers in Louisiana and over 40,000 in Mississippi were left in the dark.

Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency and warned residents of the potential for significant flooding. "This is a dangerous storm, and we need everyone to take it seriously," he said.

Ida's storm surge reversed the flow of the Mississippi River, causing damage to buildings and infrastructure. Petty Officer Gabriel Wisdom, a Coast Guard spokesman, said the surge was "extremely dangerous" and urged residents to stay away from the river.

In LaPlace, near Lake Pontchartrain, significant flooding and calls for boat rescues were reported. Ricky Boyette, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said the flooding was "catastrophic" and warned residents to seek higher ground.

The storm's impact was felt particularly hard in areas important for petrochemical sites and major ports, already under strain from COVID-19. Marco Apostolico, a resident, said the storm's timing couldn't be worse. "We're still recovering from the pandemic, and now this," he said.

Greg Langley, a spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, said the storm threatens weeks of recovery, with widespread damage and impacts on critical infrastructure. "It's going to be a long road ahead," he said.

No mandatory evacuation was ordered for New Orleans due to the storm's swift intensification. However, residents were urged to prepare for the worst. "This is a serious storm, and we need everyone to take it seriously," said Gov. Edwards.

Ida's fury was evident in the widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. Roofs were blown off buildings, and debris littered the streets. The storm's winds howled through the city, causing widespread power outages and leaving residents without air conditioning in the heat.
