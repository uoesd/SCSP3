Harris faces frustration from West Wing aides, speculation about future roles

CNN – Washington D.C. – Tensions are rising between Vice President Kamala Harris and her staff and key West Wing aides, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. The frustration stems from a feeling that there is no time to address issues related to Harris' role amid other legislative and political concerns.

Harris and her circle, on the other hand, are reportedly upset that she is not being adequately prepared or positioned, feeling sidelined instead. This frustration has been building for some time, with some insiders questioning whether Harris is being well-prepared for her role as the first woman and woman of color in the position.

Lieutenant Governor of California and longtime friend of Kamala Harris, Eleni Kounalakis, acknowledged that Harris faces unique challenges in her role. "It's not an easy position to be in, especially when you're the first woman and woman of color to hold it," Kounalakis said. "She's got a lot of weight on her shoulders, and it's not always easy to navigate."

Minyon Moore, a longtime Democratic operative and important outside adviser to Harris, echoed Kounalakis' sentiments. "Kamala is a trailblazer, and that comes with its own set of challenges," Moore said. "She's got to navigate a lot of different dynamics, and it's not always easy."

Speculation is also growing among Democrats about Harris' position and potential primary challenges due to perceived weaknesses. Some even fear that President Biden might replace her on the ticket in 2024. Despite efforts to integrate Harris into significant roles within the administration, there are concerns she is not fully utilized.

Harris has less Washington experience than President Biden, which complicates her adjustment to the vice presidency. Racism and sexism are also seen as underlying issues affecting Harris' public perception and responsibilities.

Sources close to the situation claim that Harris' staff has often failed her, and her cautious approach and staff issues have been longstanding traits. Defenders of Harris are concerned about her public perception and lack of substantive work, fearing that it could hurt her politically in the long run.

Insiders believe that Harris' future roles, whether running for presidency in 2024 or supporting Biden's potential re-election, are uncertain. However, it is clear that she faces significant challenges in her current role, and how she navigates them will be closely watched by Democrats and Republicans alike.

In conclusion, the tensions between Harris and West Wing aides, combined with speculation about her future roles, highlight the challenges that come with being a trailblazer in politics. As the first woman and woman of color in the vice presidency, Harris faces unique obstacles, and how she overcomes them will be crucial in shaping her political legacy.
