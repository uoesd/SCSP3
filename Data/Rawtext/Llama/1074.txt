Search for Missing Gabby Petito Continues in Utah, Timeline of Travels Revealed

SALT LAKE CITY – The search for missing Gabby Petito continues, with Utah law enforcement experts saying that finding her without her boyfriend's cooperation will be "extremely difficult." FOX 13 has created a timeline of Gabby and her boyfriend Brian Laundrie's travels in Utah, largely based on their Instagram posts.

The couple's travels in Utah included visits to popular national parks and hot springs, including Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, Mystic Hot Springs, Canyonlands, and Arches National Park. Gabby used an app called AllTrails to document her hiking and driving activities, which often matched her Instagram posts.

The last hike Gabby documented on AllTrails was in Mystic Hot Springs on July 24. On August 12, they had an encounter with police in Moab, which was captured on body cam video. The last Instagram post from either Gabby or Brian was on August 25 from Ogden, Utah.

Gabby's family has released an open letter to Laundrie's parents seeking information. They stayed at the Fairfield Inn and Suites near the Salt Lake City airport on August 24. There's a call for any sightings of Gabrielle Petito to be reported to the FBI.

Utah law enforcement experts say that without Brian's cooperation, finding Gabby will be a challenge. "It's going to be extremely difficult to locate her without his help," said former FBI agent and law enforcement analyst, Dr. Bryanna Fox. "He's the last person to have seen her, and he's not cooperating with authorities. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack."

Gabby's family is desperate for answers and is urging Brian to come forward with any information he may have. "We just want to know where she is," said Gabby's mother, Nicole Schmidt. "We want to know that she's safe. We want to know that she's alive."

The case has gained widespread attention, with many on social media using the hashtag #FindGabby to share information and offer support to her family. The FBI has also set up a tip line for anyone with information regarding Gabby's disappearance.

As the search for Gabby continues, law enforcement officials are urging anyone with information to come forward. "We need the public's help in finding Gabrielle Petito," said FBI spokesperson, Sandra Barker. "We urge anyone with information to contact the FBI tip line immediately."
