Biden's Stimulus Checks: Who's Eligible and How to Claim Yours

President Joe Biden has signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, launching another round of stimulus checks to help alleviate the financial burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on American families. This latest round of stimulus payments comes with some changes to the eligibility criteria, particularly for non-citizens who pay taxes in the United States.

Under the American Rescue Plan, non-citizens who pay taxes as residents in the U.S. and hold a valid Social Security number are eligible for a stimulus payment. This includes lawful permanent residents and qualifying resident aliens. However, undocumented immigrants and those filing taxes with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) are not eligible for the payment.

The American Rescue Plan includes mixed immigration status families for stimulus checks, a change from the CARES Act policy. This means that lawful permanent residents, qualifying resident aliens, DACA participants, TPS individuals, and H1-B visa holders with Social Security numbers are eligible for the payment. Nonresident aliens, foreign government-related individuals, teachers/trainees, foreign students, and professional athletes typically do not qualify.

U.S. citizens living abroad are also eligible for a stimulus check provided they meet certain criteria. Eligible recipients abroad will receive payments via direct deposit or paper check based on the information on file with the IRS.

To claim their stimulus check, eligible individuals will need to file their 2020 taxes and include their valid Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). The IRS will use the information from tax returns to determine eligibility and issue payments.

Individuals who didn't receive the first two stimulus checks can claim them through the Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 taxes. This includes those who may have missed the deadline or were not eligible at the time of the previous stimulus payments.

The American Rescue Plan Act also includes provisions for automatic payments to certain groups, such as Social Security beneficiaries and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients. These individuals will not need to file taxes to receive their stimulus payment.

The IRS is expected to begin issuing stimulus payments in the coming weeks, with payments being made automatically to eligible individuals. Recipients can check the status of their payment using the IRS's "Get My Payment" tool, which will be available on the IRS website.

In conclusion, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 offers much-needed financial relief to eligible individuals, including non-citizens who pay taxes in the U.S. and U.S. citizens living abroad. By understanding the eligibility criteria and filing their taxes, individuals can claim their stimulus check and receive the financial support they need during this challenging time.
