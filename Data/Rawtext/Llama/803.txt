Stimulus Checks for College-Age Americans: What You Need to Know

College-age Americans who were not eligible for stimulus checks in 2020 may still have the opportunity to receive up to $1,800 when they file their 2020 tax returns. The Recovery Rebate Credit, which combines both rounds of stimulus payments into one credit, offers a way for eligible individuals to claim the stimulus money they missed out on due to their dependency status on previous returns.

To qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit, individuals must meet certain requirements, including having a Social Security number, meeting income limits, not being claimed as a dependent for 2020, and filing a 2020 tax return. Additionally, claimants must report the amount of stimulus received to qualify for any additional credit.

Adult dependents, including college students and retirees, were originally excluded from receiving stimulus checks. However, the 2020 tax returns offer a way for these individuals to claim the stimulus money they missed out on.

There is no provision requiring repayment of stimulus money if 2020 income disqualifies the recipient. This means that even if an individual's income exceeds the income limits for stimulus eligibility in 2020, they will not have to pay back any stimulus money they received.

To claim the Recovery Rebate Credit, individuals can use online tax software, which can simplify the process. The deadline to file 2020 tax returns is April 15, unless an extension is granted.

It's important to note that qualifications for stimulus checks include meeting income limits, which vary based on filing status and family size. Single filers with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $75,000 or less are eligible for the full $1,800, while those with an AGI between $75,000 and $99,000 are eligible for a reduced amount. Married couples filing jointly with an AGI of $150,000 or less are eligible for the full $1,800, while those with an AGI between $150,000 and $198,000 are eligible for a reduced amount.

In addition to meeting income limits, individuals must also have a Social Security number and not be claimed as a dependent for 2020. This means that college students who were claimed as dependents on their parents' tax return in 2020 will not be eligible for the Recovery Rebate Credit.

The Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable tax credit, which means that if the credit exceeds the amount of taxes owed, the individual will receive a refund for the difference. For example, if an individual owes $1,000 in taxes and is eligible for a $1,800 Recovery Rebate Credit, they will receive a refund of $800.

To claim the Recovery Rebate Credit, individuals will need to file Form 1040 or Form 1040A. They will also need to complete the Recovery Rebate Credit Worksheet, which can be found in the instructions for Form 1040 or Form 1040A.

In conclusion, college-age Americans who were not eligible for stimulus checks in 2020 may still have the opportunity to receive up to $1,800 when they file their 2020 tax returns. The Recovery Rebate Credit offers a way for eligible individuals to claim the stimulus money they missed out on due to their dependency status on previous returns.
