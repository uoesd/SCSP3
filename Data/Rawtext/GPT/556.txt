Afghan Siblings Injured in Kabul Attack Begin New Chapter in the US

CNN – In a profound testament to resilience and human kindness, 13-year-old Ahmad Faisal and his 7-year-old sister Mina, who were gravely injured in the Kabul airport suicide bombing, have safely arrived in the United States for medical treatment and to join family members. Their arrival marks a poignant chapter in their journey from Afghanistan, ripped apart by violence and the resurgence of the Taliban.

The children's aunt, Ferishta, with whom they will be residing, described their reunion as the "best day of my life". Speaking on their arrival, she shared the mixture of overwhelming joy and profound sorrow that frames their story. "Seeing them step onto U.S. soil, safe, after everything they've been through was indescribable," Ferishta said, her voice heavy with emotion. "But it's tempered by what they've lost and what's still left unsaid."

Their story is a harrowing narrative of loss and separation in the midst of Afghanistan's chaos following the Taliban takeover. In the terrifying aftermath of the ISIS-K orchestrated attack at Kabul airport, the children's family attempted to flee the country. During the chaos, Ahmad Faisal and Mina were separated from their father and older brother, who survived but were unable to locate them afterward. Tragedy compounded their ordeal with the death of their mother in the attack, a reality the children are yet to learn.

In an extraordinary effort to survive and stick together, Ahmad Faisal and Mina were evacuated to Germany with the assistance of a neighbor. Here began their journey to recovery and eventually, to the United States.

Their aunt Ferishta, a U.S. citizen, has taken on the monumental task of caring for them. She indicates that the time to disclose the truth about their mother's fate will come, but only once they have settled and feel secure in their new environment. "It's a conversation no one should ever have to have, but we'll face it as a family," she bravely stated.

The path to U.S. soil was assisted by Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. John Bradley, who runs the Lamia Afghan Foundation. Bradley's interaction with the family came under tragic circumstances; he had sent the documents to them which ultimately directed them towards the airport at the time of the attack. Speaking on the matter, Bradley expressed a profound sense of responsibility towards their situation. "I feel like we have to do everything we can to make this right. They were following my direction, and it's led us here," he said.

Bradley's organization has been instrumental in coordinating efforts to bring the whole family together in Virginia, where Ferishta resides. The ultimate goal is to reunite Ahmad Faisal and Mina with their father and brother, healing a family torn apart by war and terror.

As efforts continue to bring the family together, the story of Ahmad Faisal and Mina serves as a tragic reminder of the countless lives affected by the turmoil in Afghanistan. Yet, in the face of such adversity, the resilience of the human spirit and the kindness of those reaching out to help shine as beacons of hope.
