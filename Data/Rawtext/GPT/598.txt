Harris at Crossroads: Vice President's Role and Future Stir Contention and Concern

CNN – Inside the bustling corridors of the West Wing, murmurs of frustration and concern paint a complex picture of Vice President Kamala Harris's current standing in the Biden Administration. Sources close to the administration report a growing frustration among key aides with both Harris and her staff, tying their hands at a time when legislative and political priorities demand undivided attention.

Amid these internal criticisms, individuals within Harris's circle voice their own concerns, feeling that the Vice President is being sidelined rather than adequately prepared or positioned for significant roles. This dynamic has fueled speculation about her future, be it as a contender for the presidency in 2024 should President Biden decide not to run, or as a key supporter should he seek re-election.

Scrutiny of Harris is undeniably high, as she navigates the complexities of being the first woman — and the first woman of color — to occupy the vice-presidency. Eleni Kounalakis, Lieutenant Governor of California and a longtime friend of Harris, notes, "The level of scrutiny that she's under is significantly more intense. And it's impossible to separate that out from the fact that she is a woman, and she is a woman of color."

Behind the scenes, there are growing concerns within Harris's defenders about her public perception and the substance of her workload. Some even harbor fears that Biden might consider replacing her, as speculation circulates among Democrats regarding Harris's position and potential primary challenges due to perceived weaknesses.

Harris's background undoubtedly shapes her vice-presidential tenure; with less Washington experience than Biden, her adjustment to the role is compounded by the high expectations placed upon her. Minyon Moore, a longtime Democratic operative and an important outside adviser to Harris, emphasizes the vice president's groundbreaking position: "Remember, she has less experience than President Biden had, so her learning curve might be more public."

Central to the debate on Harris's performance are the interwoven issues of racism and sexism, which critics argue influence both her public perception and the distribution of her responsibilities. In this vein, concerns over Harris's underutilization within the administration surface, despite efforts to integrate her into significant roles and initiatives.

Complications with Harris's own staff and her cautious approach to politics have been cited as longstanding traits that sometimes limit her effectiveness. Insiders claim Harris's staff has often failed her, contributing to a scenario where her potential is not fully realized.

Despite these challenges, Harris's advocates argue that with proper support and alignment, she can overcome these hurdles and fulfill the historic promise of her role. The ongoing debate over her performance and future reflect not only the complexities inherent in breaking new ground but also the broader dynamics at play within the current administration and the Democratic Party at large.
