Chris Cuomo Spotted Loading Christmas Cheer Before Blasting 'Woke' Thanksgiving Critics

In the quaint town of Amagansett, New York, Chris Cuomo was seen embracing the festive spirit, loading Christmas wreaths into his Tesla as Thanksgiving day unfolded. The former CNN anchor, alongside his wife, Cristina, took some time away from the airwaves to pick out Christmas decorations, a tradition that seemingly hasn't wavered in the Cuomo household despite recent controversies surrounding the family.

However, the holiday spirit didn't prevent Cuomo from using his SiriusXM radio show as a platform to air grievances about the current state of Thanksgiving celebrations in America. The radio airwaves crackled with Cuomo's frustration toward what he perceives as an intrusion of 'woke culture' into the cherished holiday. According to Cuomo, Thanksgiving is his favorite holiday, yet he voiced disappointment over how 'woke folks' have arguably marred its observance through their critique of the historical context.

Challenging the growing reevaluation of Thanksgiving's roots—a holiday linked to the pilgrims and indigenous peoples—Cuomo boldly stated his disinterest in the historical underpinnings. "I don't care about the pilgrims or indigenous peoples for the purpose of the holiday," Cuomo declared, simplifying Thanksgiving to its core essence of gratitude and familial bonds, at least in his view. This disregard for the holiday's complex history has ignited conversations among listeners and critics alike, as many continue to reconcile the traditional American holiday with its fraught past.

On a tangentially related note, Andrew Cuomo, Chris Cuomo's brother and the disgraced former Governor of New York, offered a markedly different tone on Thanksgiving day. Opting for positivity, the elder Cuomo shared an uplifting Thanksgiving message, perhaps an effort to rehabilitate his public image. This comes after Andrew Cuomo resigned in disgrace in August, following a damning report by the New York Attorney General that substantiated allegations of sexual harassment against him.

Amidst these family controversies, Chris Cuomo's broadcasting career has encountered its own turbulence. November witnessed his primetime CNN show, 'Cuomo Prime Time,' plummeting to an all-time low in ratings, as per Nielsen Media Research. Last week alone, the show only managed to draw 684,000 average total viewers, a significant fall from grace since its debut back in June 2018. Despite this stark decline, it's notable that 'Cuomo Prime Time' remains CNN's highest-rated show as of August, a silver lining in an otherwise clouded scenario.

Chris Cuomo's dip in popularity cannot be entirely disentangled from his brother's public fall. The sexual misconduct allegations against Andrew Cuomo and the subsequent investigations have cast a long shadow over Chris, despite his efforts to distance himself professionally. This relation, whether fair or not, has led to conjecture about the impact of the Cuomo family saga on Chris's viewership numbers and overall standing with the public.

The juxtaposition of the Cuomo brothers' Thanksgiving messages—Chris Cuomo's lament over the politicization of the holiday versus Andrew Cuomo's attempt at positivity—paints a vivid picture of two men navigating public and private challenges. As Chris loads up his Tesla with holiday decorations, aiming to bring a piece of traditional joy into his home, it's clear both brothers are seeking to move forward in their own ways, whether through the spirit of the holiday season or by reaching out with messages of hope and renewal.

As the holiday season progresses, it will be interesting to see how the Cuomos continue to publicly grapple with their respective controversies and whether the spirit of Thanksgiving, with its themes of gratitude and reflection, will have any lasting impact on their personal and professional journeys.
