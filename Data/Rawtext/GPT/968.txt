Twitter Bans Trump, Citing Risk of Inciting Violence

CNN – In an unprecedented move, Twitter has permanently suspended the account of President Donald Trump, citing a "risk of further incitement of violence." The decision comes in the wake of recent tweets by Trump and the violent events that unfolded at the Capitol, propelling the social media giant to take decisive action against the President's online behavior.

Twitter's bold step marks a significant moment in the relationship between social media platforms and political figures, highlighting the growing concern over the power of online speech to incite real-world violence. The suspension targets Trump's @realDonaldTrump account, which had been his primary means of communication with the public throughout his presidency.

The decision was influenced by two specific tweets from Trump that Twitter identified as violating its policy against the glorification of violence. The first tweet made veiled references to Trump's supporters, hinting at continued support for those who believe the false claim that he won the election. The second tweet ominously announced that Trump would not be attending Joe Biden's inauguration, a move that Twitter interpreted as further incitement to violence.

In explaining its decision, Twitter outlined that these tweets must be read in the broader context of recent events and how they might be mobilized by different audiences, especially those considering violent acts. The platform stressed that the use of its service to incite violence, directly or indirectly, is strictly forbidden.

Furthermore, Twitter has implemented measures to prevent evasion of the ban, strictly specifying that it applies to the @realDonaldTrump account. In a test of this policy, Trump attempted to use the @POTUS account to broadcast messages attacking Twitter's decision and announcing plans to examine the possibilities of building out his own platform. However, those tweets were also quickly removed.

The Trump campaign's Twitter account faced a similar fate after it tried to relay Trump's messages post-ban, leading to its permanent suspension. Mike Hahn, Social Media Director for the Trump campaign, decried the ban as unfair, stating, "Censoring the president of the United States on social media platforms is a threat to free speech and democracy."

Civil rights leaders and organizations have roundly praised Twitter's decision. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, commended the platform for taking a stand, stating, "This necessary action finally addresses a dangerous source of violence and hate, curtailing the ability to embolden extremists." Similarly, Eric Naing, spokesman for Muslim Advocates, expressed his approval, saying, "Twitter's decision to ban Trump is a victory for everyone who has fought against his hate speech and division."

Twitter also clarified its position on users quoting Trump's words, distinguishing between journalistic reporting on his statements and attempts by accounts to bypass the ban by repeating the messages verbatim. This delineation aims to ensure that while the news can be reported, the spread of potentially harmful rhetoric is controlled.

In taking this decisive action, Twitter has opened a new chapter in the debate over freedom of speech and the responsibilities of social media platforms to prevent their services from being used to incite violence.
