Jesuit Priest Who Led Biden's Inaugural Mass Under Investigation

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) – Rev. Kevin O'Brien, known for presiding over President Joe Biden's inaugural Mass, is currently under investigation following unspecified allegations against him. Amid the ongoing inquiry, O'Brien has taken a leave of absence from his role as president at Santa Clara University, a distinguished Jesuit college.

The allegations against O'Brien reportedly pertain to "behaviors in adult settings, consisting primarily of conversations," which may contravene the protocols of Jesuit conduct. While specifics of the allegations have not been disclosed, the nature of the investigation underscores the seriousness with which the Jesuit community views adherence to their established code of conduct.

John M. Sobrato, the chairman of the board at Santa Clara University, shed light on the situation in a recent statement, acknowledging the commencement of the investigation and confirming O'Brien's temporary departure. "The Board is committed to ensuring the integrity of the investigation process, and upholding the principles of justice and fairness that define the values of our university community," Sobrato expressed, highlighting the institution's commitment to transparency and accountability.

Tracey Primrose, spokesperson for the Jesuits West Province overseeing the probe, reiterated the society's commitment to a professional code of conduct, stating, "As Jesuits, we are dedicated to a standard of respect and safety in all of our interactions. The investigation into Rev. O'Brien reflects our commitment to uphold these values and our dedication to the welfare of all members of our community."

Rev. O'Brien, who has a longstanding relationship with President Biden spanning about 15 years, played a significant role in Biden's spiritual life, having also presided over services during Biden's previous inaugurations as vice president. The current allegations remain shrouded in confidentiality, with neither the specifics nor the nature of the complaints being made public.

O'Brien joined the Society of Jesus in 1996 and was ordained in 2006. His affiliation with Santa Clara University—as its president—places him at the helm of one of the foremost Jesuit institutions, home to roughly 5,500 undergraduate students.

Despite the ongoing investigation, O'Brien and the Jesuits West Province have chosen not to comment publicly on the matter, maintaining a silence that underscores the sensitive nature of the proceedings and their potential implications.
