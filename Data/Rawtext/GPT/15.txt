A Purple Reign: Inauguration Day's Royal Hue Calls for Unity and Change

When President Joseph R. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were sworn into office, an unexpected but deeply symbolic color took center stage: purple. Not just a random choice for style, the color was prominently displayed in the attire of Dr. Jill Biden, Kamala Harris, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, Amy Klobuchar, and even worn in a tie by Mike Pence. This sartorial selection went beyond fashion, carrying with it layers of meaning and a profound message about America's past, present, and future.

Purple, a color that historically symbolizes royalty, seemed to reclaim America's tangled relationship with monarchy, suggesting a rebirth of the nation's desire for dignity in leadership and a form of cultural royalty that aligns with democratic values. The hue also represents sacrifice and honor, reminiscent of the Purple Heart awarded to those wounded or killed while serving in the U.S. military. This context lends the color an air of solemnity and respect during a time of transition and reflection.

However, the choice of purple at the inauguration did more than evoke the past; it spoke directly to a nation in need of healing and unity. "Purple is the coming together of red and blue, and it is a symbolic gesture towards bipartisanship and harmony across the political aisle," said Gwendolyn Dubois Shaw, Senior Historian at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery. This sentiment of unity was further enhanced by the literary nod to Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, 'The Color Purple', highlighting the struggles and resilience of African American women, and parallelly marking the historic moment of Harris's inauguration.

In an era marked by political division and conflict, the deliberate choice of purple served as a powerful statement against the backdrop of recent events. It signified an attempt to bridge divides, fostering a sense of national community and shared purpose. "The inauguration's purple theme was a visible contrast to the red hats symbolic of the previous administration, representing a call for change, for coming together as a nation," Shaw remarked.

This poignant embrace of purple on Inauguration Day symbolizes not just a yearning for political unity but an affirmation of the values and aspirations that define America. It is a color imbued with the promise of change, the honor of sacrifice, and the enduring hope of a nation striving for a more united future.
