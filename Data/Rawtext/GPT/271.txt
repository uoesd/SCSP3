COVID-19 Deaths in Nursing Homes Surge Amid Delta Variant Wave

As the United States continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, long-term care facilities have been at the forefront of the struggle, accounting for 31% of all COVID-19 deaths in the country as of June 30, 2021. These facilities, which cater to some of the most vulnerable populations, including older adults and individuals with disabilities, saw a significant drop in weekly COVID-19 cases and deaths to an all-time low in June 2021, thanks to the widespread rollout of vaccinations. This promising trend, unfortunately, was short-lived. August 2021 witnessed a sharp and alarming increase in both COVID-19 cases and deaths in these facilities, attributed to the highly contagious Delta variant. Nearly 1,800 COVID-19-related deaths were reported in US nursing homes in August, marking the highest monthly toll since February 2021 and underscored a quadruple increase in deaths between July and August 2021. Additionally, a staggering 440% increase in COVID-19 cases in nursing homes was observed during the same period, signaling a distressing setback in the fight against the pandemic within these critical care settings.

In response to the escalating crisis, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has endorsed an extra dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for residents in long-term care settings to bolster their defenses against the virus. Moreover, the Biden administration has announced a staff vaccination mandate for nursing homes, aiming to curb the spread of COVID-19 within these facilities. As of mid-September 2021, approximately 84% of nursing home residents and 64% of nursing home staff have been vaccinated. These measures highlight the continued efforts to protect some of the nation's most susceptible populations and underscore the pandemic's disproportionate impact on these communities. The recent surges serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges in managing COVID-19 and the critical importance of vaccination and preventive strategies to safeguard those in long-term care facilities.
