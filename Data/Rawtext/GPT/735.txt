Tucson Officer Faces Termination Over Fatal Shooting of Man in Wheelchair

TUCSON, Ariz. – In a startling incident that has garnered national attention, a Tucson officer is to be dismissed from service for the fatal shooting of 61-year-old Richard Lee Richards. The man, who was in a motorized wheelchair, was shot nine times from behind, sparking a wave of controversy over the use of force by law enforcement.

The episode unfolded after Richards was suspected of shoplifting a toolbox from a Walmart. Authorities reported that he allegedly brandished a knife at an employee who confronted him. Officer Ryan Remington, who has been with the Tucson Police Department for four years, was identified as the shooter. The incident took an alarming turn as Richards, attempting to enter a Lowe's store, was shot from behind, a moment captured on surveillance and body camera footage.

At the time of the incident, Officer Remington was working off-duty as a security officer for Walmart. Upon noticing the alleged shoplifting, he pursued Richards and requested backup. The pursuit ended tragically with Richards' death outside the Lowe's store.

The Pima County Attorney's Office is currently reviewing the fatal shooting to determine if criminal charges should be filed against Officer Remington. This review comes amidst a storm of criticism directed at Remington's actions on that fateful day.

Tucson Police Chief Chris Magnus condemned the shooting, stating, "This use of deadly force in this incident is a clear violation of department policy and directly contradicts multiple aspects of our use-of-force and training." He highlighted that the actions taken by Officer Remington did not align with the department's standards or training protocols.

Despite the outcry, Mike Storie, the attorney representing Officer Remington, defended his client's actions. Storie argued, "Given the situation, Officer Remington had no nonlethal options due to the placement of the wheelchair." He insists that Remington was left with minimal choices in the heat of the moment.

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero expressed her horror at the incident, characterizing the actions as "unconscionable and indefensible." "Our community is in shock at the unnecessary use of deadly force by an officer against a member of our community," she added, supporting the ongoing investigation into the tragic event.

This incident follows closely on the heels of another investigation involving an off-duty officer in Tucson, raising questions and concerns about the practices and policies of the local police force.

The shooting and subsequent actions taken against Officer Remington have ignited a debate over police training, the use of force, and how officers handle confrontations with individuals with disabilities. As the community grapples with these questions, the investigation by the Pima County Attorney's Office continues, with many awaiting its findings and the potential for charges to bring some measure of accountability in the wake of Richard Lee Richards' death.
