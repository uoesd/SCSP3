New Details Unfold in 'Rust' Set Tragic Shooting Incident

NEW YORK – The ongoing investigation into the tragic shooting on the set of the film 'Rust' that led to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza has taken a new turn. Dave Halls' attorney, Lisa Torraco, made a critical statement pointing out that actor Alec Baldwin, involved in the fatal incident, did not pull the trigger of the prop gun that discharged.

In defense of Baldwin, who also stated in a separate ABC News interview, "I didn't pull the trigger," the circumstances around the tragic event continue to stir debates and inquiries. The incident, which occurred on Oct. 21 during a dress rehearsal at the Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe, New Mexico, is under rigorous analysis by authorities to uncover the sequence of events leading to Hutchins' death.

The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office has been delving into the details of the day's events, identifying Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film's armorer, and Dave Halls, the first assistant director, as key figures who handled the gun prior to the shooting. According to attorney Lisa Torraco, "This was a freak, awful accident." She emphasized Halls's heartbreak over the incident, portraying him as distraught over the tragedy.

No charges have been filed as of yet concerning the shooting, but the case remains open to various possibilities. Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies stated, "Everything is on the table at this point. We do not know yet whether charges will be filed."

The investigation has broadened its scope to include the origins of the live rounds that ended up on set. A recent search at a local gun store sought to bring new insights into how live ammunition found its way to the 'Rust' set, but officials have yet to confirm the source of the rounds.

In a testament to the deep dive into the incident, the Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza referred to the situation as "complex," implying the intricacies involved in piecing together the events of that fateful day. "We're working to gather as much information as possible to determine how this tragedy occurred," Mendoza said.

Adding to the discourse on the incident, two ABC specials are scheduled to air, aiming to shed light on the 'Rust' shooting. These specials will feature interviews with Alec Baldwin among others closely involved, hoping to provide a clearer picture of the sequence of events.

According to a search warrant affidavit, moments before the shooting, Halls handed the gun to Baldwin, communicating to the crew that it was a "cold gun," indicating it should not have contained any live rounds. However, the discharge that followed contradicted this assurance.

Director Joel Souza, who was injured in the incident, has been relatively private, only speaking through official statements. The focus remains on understanding what led to the live ammunition being present in the firearm and how future incidents of this nature can be prevented.

The production of 'Rust' has been halted indefinitely, with cast and crew, along with the broader film industry, reflecting on the protocols concerning firearm safety on set. This incident has spurred calls for stricter control measures and possibly the implementation of new safety standards within the industry.

As the investigation continues, the grief over Halyna Hutchins' untimely passing remains palpable. Tributes pour in from across the globe, highlighting her talent and contributions to the cinematic worlds she helped bring to life. Her death has ignited a fervent discussion on ensuring the utmost safety of those working on film sets.

The legal outcomes and the potential for charges in the 'Rust' shooting case remain uncertain as investigators diligently work to piece together the details of what transpired. The film industry and the public closely watch as the case unfolds, hoping for answers and actions that will prevent future tragedies of this nature.

As Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies hinted at the comprehensive nature of the ongoing investigation, she encapsulatively noted, "We're looking at all aspects of this case, from how the live rounds ended up on set to the procedures followed during the rehearsal."

This incident, both devastating and illuminating, has indeed shone a light on the critical need for stringent safety measures on film sets, emphasizing that the art of filmmaking should never come at the cost of human life.
