Tom Brady Tackles Fashion: Launches New Brand with Industry Titans

In an exciting evolution off the field, NFL legend Tom Brady is transitioning his competitive spirit into the fashion arena with the launch of his new fashion label, 'Brady'. The brand, set to make its debut in December, promises a fresh collection of activewear and training clothes aimed at setting a new standard in sportswear excellence.

The venture sees Brady teaming up with Jens Grede, the cofounder of Skims, and Dao-Yi Chow, the creative mind behind Public School New York. These collaborations signal a formidable team, combining sports iconography with cutting-edge fashion acumen. Grede will not only lend his expertise as the brand's cofounder but will also steer the ship as its CEO.

The ambition for 'Brady' is clear: to position itself among the titans of sportswear, drawing a parallel with Michael Jordan's legendary Jordan Brand. This lofty goal is solidified by Grede's established track record of developing successful direct-to-consumer fashion brands, including Skims and Good American. With his brands expected to cumulatively generate upwards of $500 million in revenue for 2021, the potential for 'Brady' is palpable.

"Our vision for 'Brady' has been in the works for three years," Jens Grede explains. "We're not just creating another activewear label. We aim to craft the finest sports brand in the world, one that seamlessly combines form, function, and fashion."

Collaborator Dao-Yi Chow adds, "Working with Tom and Jens on 'Brady' has been an incredible journey. Our collective ambition is to innovate and inspire, making 'Brady' synonymous with excellence in sportswear."

Given the three-year developmental period, it's clear that 'Brady' is not just a spur-of-the-moment venture but a carefully curated project that aims to reflect the dedication and precision Brady is known for on the football field.

Grede's involvement in the brand suggests an anticipated launch that could redefine the landscape of sportswear. Already a figure synonymous with success in the direct-to-consumer fashion space, his venture into sportswear with 'Brady' is watched keenly by industry insiders and fashion enthusiasts alike.

In the bustling and competitive world of fashion, 'Brady' emerges not just as a brand, but as a statement of intent. With a team that boasts a blend of sports excellence and fashion flair, the brand is on a trajectory to redefine the possibilities within activewear and training clothes.

In conclusion, as the December launch date approaches, the industry and fans alike are on the edge of their seats, eager to witness the dawn of a new era in sportswear. With 'Brady', Tom Brady aims to quarterback not just on the field, but in the fashion game as well, marking an ambitious new chapter in an already storied career.
