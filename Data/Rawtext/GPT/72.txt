House Panel Targets Extremist Groups in Jan. 6 Capitol Riot Investigation

In a significant move to delve deeper into the circumstances surrounding the January 6 Capitol riot, the House select committee has issued subpoenas to key members and groups including the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, and their leaders Henry 'Enrique' Tarrio and Elmer Stewart Rhodes. This action is part of a broader effort to examine the roots and execution of the violent event that disrupted the confirmation of President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory. Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) emphasized the importance of these subpoenas, stating, "We believe the individuals and organizations we subpoenaed today have relevant information about how violence erupted at the Capitol and the preparations leading up to this violent attack." The bipartisan panel, investigating the assault by supporters of former President Donald Trump, has previously issued dozens of subpoenas to uncover the extent of preparations and coordination among groups that attacked the Capitol. The focus on groups like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, and 1st Amendment Praetorian sheds light on the orchestrated efforts behind the scenes, reinforcing the committee's commitment to unraveling the threads of conspiracy and preparation that led to the January 6 insurrection.
