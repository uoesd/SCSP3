NIH Launches Clinical Trial on Mixed Booster COVID-19 Vaccines

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has initiated a critical Phase 1/2 clinical trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of mixed booster regimens for COVID-19 vaccines. This pioneering trial, spearheaded and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) through the Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium, aims to prepare for the eventuality of booster shots in light of dwindling immunity over time and the continuous evolution of the virus.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Director of NIAID, emphasized the importance of this research. "Given the potential decline in immunity and the emergence of new virus variants, we need to be proactively prepared. This study will help us stay ahead by identifying the most effective booster strategies to protect the public over time," said Fauci.

The trial will include 150 participants previously vaccinated under the emergency use authorization of the three available vaccines in the U.S. These participants are slated to receive a booster dose of the Moderna vaccine. Additionally, separate groups of initially unvaccinated volunteers will receive the complete two-dose regimen of Moderna's vaccine, allowing researchers to evaluate responses in a variety of scenarios.

This innovative adaptive trial design is scheduled to possibly include new arms, aligning with the authorization of additional vaccines or the advent of variant-specific vaccines. Participants will be monitored for a year following vaccination, focusing on the safety, side effects, and the detailed immune response generated by mixed vaccine regimens.

Principal Investigator Robert L. Atmar, M.D., from Baylor College of Medicine, highlighted the trial's significance. "This study is pivotal not just for understanding vaccine-induced immunity but also in setting future public health policies regarding booster vaccinations," Atmar stated. Kirsten E. Lyke, M.D., another Principal Investigator from the University of Maryland, College Park, added, "Our research will provide crucial data on the efficacy of mixing vaccine types, with the potential to significantly impact global COVID-19 vaccine strategy."

Preliminary findings from this vital research are anticipated by late summer 2021, with further details on the trial available through clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT04889209. As the primary federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research in the U.S., the NIH remains committed to addressing the ongoing challenges posed by infectious diseases like COVID-19, alongside other critical health concerns, through rigorous scientific investigation.
