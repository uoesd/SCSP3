Community Mourns Heroic Student Athlete

In a heart-wrenching turn of events at Oxford High School, 16-year-old student and athlete Tate Myre ran towards danger during a school shooting, ultimately losing his life in an attempt to disarm the gunman. Tate was one of four students tragically killed in the attack.

A funeral service for Tate is scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday at Kensington Church in Lake Orion, where the community is expected to gather to remember and honor his bravery and selflessness.

Despite circulating rumors of civilian attempts to stop the shooter, Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard clarified, "There is no video evidence suggesting a civilian or student tried to disarm the shooter."

Known for his altruism on and off the field, Tate was a star in wrestling and football. He had even shifted positions on his football team for the greater good, showcasing his inherent nature to put others before himself. "Tate was the type of kid who would do anything for anyone," said JR Laefner, a public address announcer at Oxford football games and a Myre family friend.

To commemorate Tate's heroism, an online petition advocating for the renaming of the Wildcat Stadium to Tate Myre Stadium has gained tremendous support, with over 75,000 signatures backing the cause.

"Tate tried to disarm the shooter. He was trying to protect his fellow students," remarked Ross Wingert, Tate's football and wrestling coach, highlighting the young hero's actions during the tragedy.

The community, including Tate's teammates, has come together in their grief, offering support and reflecting on the profound impact Tate had on those around him. "This is something that's going to stick with us forever," said Zach Line, Oxford's football coach.

Coaches from neighboring schools have also voiced their admiration for Tate's character and bravery. Kurt Richardson, the Clarkston coach, spoke highly of Tate, as did Tony Patritto, the Rochester Adams coach, and Scott Merchant from Clinton Township Chippewa Valley, all recognizing the young athlete's exceptional courage and selflessness.

As the community prepares to say goodbye, the legacy of Tate Myre as a hero, a friend, and a beloved student athlete continues to unite those who knew him, inspiring acts of courage and kindness in his memory.
