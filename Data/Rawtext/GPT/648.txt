Racine Man Pleads Not Guilty in Case Involving Firearm Provided to Kyle Rittenhouse

RACINE, WI - In a Racine County courtroom today, Dominick Black, 19, entered a plea of not guilty to allegations that he provided Kyle Rittenhouse, then 17 years old, with an AR-15-style rifle. The charges against Black include two counts of providing a dangerous weapon to someone under the age of 18, resulting in death. Each count carries a potential sentence of up to three years in prison.

Anthony Cotton, a Waukesha criminal defense attorney representing Black, argued for the dismissal of the charges. He asserts that there has been a blatant misinterpretation of the law in this case. "The charges against my client are fundamentally flawed," stated Cotton outside the courtroom. "The statutes in question were grossly misconstrued by the prosecution."

It was disclosed in court documents that the rifle in question was purchased for Rittenhouse's use while on private property and was stored in Kenosha by Black's stepfather. The narrative took a tragic turn in August in Kenosha when Rittenhouse used the rifle to fatally shoot two protesters and wound a third during chaotic protests, claiming he acted in self-defense. The events have since ignited nationwide debates over gun control, self-defense laws, and racial injustice.

Under Wisconsin law, adults are prohibited from providing firearms to minors, with narrowly defined exceptions primarily related to hunting and other closely supervised activities. However, Cotton's defense pivots on the argument that these exceptions and specifications are inapplicable to the current case since Rittenhouse was not engaged in hunting activities. "The law clearly outlines certain exceptions, none of which pertain to the situation at hand," Cotton elaborated.

Additionally, Cotton challenged the legal basis for charging Black with two counts related to the same act of transferring the weapon, raising concerns about potential violations of double jeopardy principles. During the proceedings, Judge Bruce Schroeder expressed agreement with the defense on this multiplicity issue. "It appears there's a valid argument here," said Schroeder, indicating a written ruling would likely follow by June.

Amidst the state-level proceedings, federal authorities are considering bringing charges against Black for the act of straw purchasing the rifle on behalf of Rittenhouse, an act that could result in a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Straw purchasing involves buying a firearm for someone who is legally prohibited from owning one themselves.

The case against Black unfolds parallel to the broader controversy and legal challenges facing Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted on all counts in his own trial after asserting self-defense in the shootings. The outcome of Black's case is being closely watched, as it touches upon complex issues of gun ownership, youth access to firearms, and the legal responsibilities of individuals in the chain of possession and use.

As the legal proceedings progress, the implications of this case may extend beyond the personal fate of Dominick Black. Legal experts and community advocates alike are monitoring developments for broader insights into Wisconsin's firearms laws and the potential for legislative reevaluation in the wake of this high-profile incident.

With the legal pathways still unfolding, the community awaits further judicial deliberations. Meanwhile, Anthony Cotton remains steadfast in his defense. "We are prepared to take all necessary steps to ensure a fair and just outcome for Dominick," he concluded.
