Prince Harry and Meghan's Wax Figures Move to Hollywood Zone at Madame Tussauds

LONDON, May 13 – In a move that mirrors their real-life transition from the UK to the USA, Madame Tussauds London has relocated the waxwork models of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle from the royal family section to the Hollywood zone of its popular tourist attraction. This adjustment highlights the couple's shift from their duties within the British royal family to embracing a new life under the global celebrity spotlight in Los Angeles, California.

The decision to move their figures comes a year after Prince Harry and Meghan stepped back from their roles as senior members of the royal family, a move that sent shockwaves around the world. Madame Tussauds stated that relocating the couple to the Awards Party zone alongside other high-profile celebrities symbolizes their newfound lifestyle, one that combines their philanthropic endeavors with the entertainment industry's glitz and glamour.

Amid this significant transition, Prince Harry has ventured into the world of television documentaries. Together with Oprah Winfrey, he has co-created a series focused on mental health, set to premiere on Apple TV+. Ahead of the launch, Prince Harry opened up about his unique life experiences on the 'Armchair Expert' podcast, where he likened his royal life to living in a 'Truman Show'-like bubble.

During the podcast, Harry also gave a glimpse into the early days of his relationship with Meghan, sharing how they had to meet discreetly in a supermarket to avoid paparazzi. He elaborated on the profound sense of freedom and relief they have felt since their move to California, emphasizing the simple joys of life they can now enjoy, such as taking their son Archie on bike rides—an activity he felt he couldn't have experienced back in the UK.

The relocation of Prince Harry and Meghan's waxworks to the Hollywood zone at Madame Tussauds London not only reflects the couple's physical move across the Atlantic but also marks a significant pivot in how they are perceived and engaged with by the public—from members of the royal family to global celebrities in their own right.
