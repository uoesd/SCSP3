UC Santa Cruz Stands in Solidarity Amidst Rittenhouse Verdict Disappointment

The University of California, Santa Cruz community expresses profound disappointment following the not guilty verdict in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse's acquittal on all charges, concerning the fatal shooting of two unarmed men and the wounding of another during a Black Lives Matter rally in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020, deeply concerns us. This verdict reflects a grievous failure of accountability and justice which we cannot overlook.

At a time when the nation's attention is also tuned to the trial of three white men charged with the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed Black man, the outcomes of these trials underscore the significant race-related implications at play. These events continue to cause distress, fear, and harm amongst our BIPOC communities, reflecting systemic issues that demand urgent attention and action.

UC Santa Cruz stands in unwavering solidarity with all who are outraged and pained by this verdict, reaffirming our commitment to disrupt systemic racism in all its forms. We recognize the importance of coming together to reaffirm our shared values and to support one another during these challenging times.

We encourage members of our campus community to lean on the support offered by the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. These efforts are crucial in our ongoing mission to build a more inclusive and supportive environment for all. For those feeling impacted by recent events, campus services including counseling and psychological services, along with employee assistance programs, are available. Furthermore, the Office of Equity and Equal Protection stands ready to assist anyone wishing to report discrimination.

Together, we must continue to strive for a future where justice and equality are not just ideals, but realities for everyone, regardless of race. Our collective resolve to challenge and dismantle systemic racism is more critical now than ever.
