Farmington High Students Charged in Alleged School Shooting Plot

FARMINGTON – Two students from Farmington High School are facing charges after allegedly planning a school shooting, stirring concerns in the local community and prompting a swift response from law enforcement and school officials.

The students have been charged with a third-degree felony count of conspiracy to commit aggravated battery, according to the Farmington Police Department. The plans for the alleged attack, which included a detailed map of the school and a list of needed supplies, were uncovered during an investigation initiated by a tip-off to a school resource officer from a school administrator.

Farmington School District and the Farmington Police Department are working closely together, evaluating the seriousness of the threat and implementing measures to ensure the safety of all students and staff. "We take any threat to the safety of our students incredibly seriously," stated Nicole Brown, a spokesperson for the Farmington Police. "The collaboration between the district and our department in this case has been paramount in ensuring a swift response."

Gene Schmidt, the Superintendent of Farmington Municipal Schools, emphasized the critical role of community awareness and the importance of reporting suspicious activities. "Our schools are at the heart of our community, and it's essential that we all work together to keep them safe. This situation underscores the importance of vigilance and communication," Schmidt stated.

A significant lead in the investigation was provided by a concerned student who reported the plan, highlighting the effectiveness of encouraging students to speak up about potential dangers. "It was this crucial piece of information that allowed us to act quickly," Schmidt added.

Furthermore, Steve Hebbe, Chief of the Farmington Police Department, spoke on the readiness and commitment of the police in handling such threats. "Our officers are trained to respond decisively to these situations. The safety of our schools is a top priority, and we will always act swiftly to any threat."

While the accused students reportedly did not have access to firearms in their homes, the case remains under serious investigation. A third student linked to the plan is also under investigation.

The case has spurred a broader conversation about school safety and the need for community involvement in preventing violence. Officials are currently urging both students and parents to remain alert and report any suspicious activities or concerns to authorities.

"We must all be the eyes and ears of our community, especially when it comes to protecting our children," Hebbe concluded, reinforcing the joint effort between the police, the school district, and the community at large in maintaining a safe educational environment.
