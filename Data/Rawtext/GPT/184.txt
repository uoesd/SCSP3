'Saved by the Bell' Star Dustin Diamond Dies at 44 After Battling Lung Cancer

Dustin Diamond, the actor best known for his portrayal of the quirky Samuel "Screech" Powers on the hit TV show 'Saved by the Bell,' passed away at the age of 44 after a brief but intense battle with lung cancer, his representative confirmed. In less than a month after being diagnosed with Stage 4 small cell carcinoma, a type of lung cancer, Diamond succumbed to the disease, marking a tragic end to the life of a man who once entertained millions with his comedic talent.

The actor received his devastating diagnosis just three weeks before his death, and swiftly began chemotherapy in an attempt to battle the rapidly spreading cancer. Despite initial hopes, the illness proved to be too aggressive, taking Diamond away far too soon.

Diamond rose to fame on 'Saved by the Bell,' which aired from 1989 to 1993, with his character Screech becoming one of the series' most beloved figures. He continued to play Screech in various spinoffs of the show, maintaining his role as the show evolved over the years.

However, his relationship with his co-stars became strained after Diamond released a tell-all book in 2009 that cast a shadow over the behind-the-scenes life of the show's cast. The book, which presented an unflattering picture of his time on the show and his co-stars, led to a fallout. Nevertheless, Diamond later expressed regret over the book and sought to make amends with his former colleagues.

In an unexpected revelation on 'Dr. Oz,' Diamond disclosed that his infamous 2006 sex tape involved a stuntman, with his own face digitally added to the footage. "Looking back now, in my thirties, I realize that was a young and immature mistake," Diamond reflected, acknowledging the complexity of navigating fame at a young age.

After 'Saved by the Bell,' Diamond found himself taking on minor roles in movies and making appearances on various reality shows and quiz programs. Despite his continued presence in the entertainment industry, Diamond often discussed the challenges associated with being thrust into the limelight as a child, lamenting the loss of a normal childhood.

Notably absent from the 'Saved by the Bell' revival on Peacock in 2020, Diamond's legacy within the original series remains untouched by his subsequent controversies.

In the wake of his passing, former co-stars Mario Lopez and Tiffani Thiessen took to Instagram to offer their condolences and reflect on their time with Diamond. Lopez noted, "Dustin, you will be missed my man. The fragility of this life is something never to be taken for granted." Thiessen wrote, "I am deeply saddened by the news of my old co-star @realdustindiamond passing. Life is extremely fragile and it's something we should never take for granted. God speed, Dustin."

Dustin Diamond's life, filled with notable highs and unmistakable lows, left a lasting impression on those who knew him and watched him grow up on screen. As the world mourns the loss of a talent taken too soon, the memories of Diamond's performances will undoubtedly continue to bring smiles to the faces of those who cherished them.
