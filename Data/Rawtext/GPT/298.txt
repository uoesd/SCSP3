WHO Grants Emergency Use Listing to COVAXIN® for COVID-19 Prevention

In a significant move, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced an emergency use listing (EUL) for COVAXIN®, a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech. This marks COVAXIN® as the eighth vaccine globally to receive WHO's prestigious EUL for the fight against COVID-19, highlighting its critical role in addressing the ongoing pandemic and facilitating global health and safety.

The EUL by WHO is a pivotal mechanism for the COVAX facility concerning vaccine supply. It enables countries to expedite their vaccine approval processes, thereby accelerating the vaccination campaigns crucial for curtailing the pandemic. By granting EUL to COVAXIN®, WHO assists in bolstering the portfolio of vaccines available under the COVAX initiative, ensuring broader accessibility especially for low- and middle-income countries.

Dr. Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products, emphasized the importance of vaccines in the current global health crisis. Dr. Simão stated, "Vaccination remains a key part of the global effort to overcome this pandemic. We must ensure that vaccines are distributed equitably, prioritizing those in greatest need, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The EUL for COVAXIN® is a step in the right direction towards achieving this goal."

The process leading up to the emergency use listing of COVAXIN® involved rigorous evaluation of its efficacy, safety, and quality by WHO's Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Immunization and the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE). This comprehensive review ensures that only vaccines meeting the highest standards are recommended for use.

Formulated from an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 antigen, COVAXIN® is particularly suited for low- and middle-income countries due to its storage requirements, which are more easily met compared to some other COVID-19 vaccines. This feature makes it an important tool in the fight against COVID-19, allowing for broader distribution and accessibility worldwide.

SAGE has recommended a two-dose regimen for COVAXIN®, administered four weeks apart, for individuals aged 18 years and older. This recommendation comes after thorough consideration of the vaccine's performance in clinical trials, which demonstrated a 78% efficacy against COVID-19 of any severity, 14 days following the administration of the second dose.

Further attesting to the vaccine's safety, over 120,000 pregnant women in India have received COVAXIN® without reporting any significant short-term adverse effects. This is crucial information that adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the vaccine's safety profile across different population groups.

For COVAXIN® to achieve full licensure and WHO prequalification, the producing company, Bharat Biotech, is required to continue the generation of data. This post-EUL phase is essential for maintaining the highest standards of vaccine safety and efficacy, ensuring continued public trust and confidence in the vaccination efforts worldwide.

WHO's EUL for COVAXIN® signifies a monumental stride in the global fight against COVID-19. It reaffirms the organization's commitment to health equity, ensuring that all countries, regardless of income level, have access to effective and safe vaccines. As the world continues to grapple with the pandemic, initiatives like the emergency use listing are vital for fostering global solidarity and expediting the path towards recovery and normalization.
