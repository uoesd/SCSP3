Prince Philip's Mixed Feelings on Harry's Royal Departure and Oprah Interview

The late Prince Philip had complex feelings about Prince Harry's decision to step back from his royal duties and the subsequent media storm following Harry and Meghan's candid interview with Oprah Winfrey, sources close to the royal family reveal. While the Duke of Edinburgh was reportedly disappointed by Harry's decision to quit royal duties, he understood and even sympathized with his grandson's frustrations with the invasive British press.

Philip's understanding, however, did not extend to Harry and Meghan's choice to publicly air their grievances in the widely viewed interview with Oprah, which he is said to have called "madness." Despite being hospitalized at the time the interview aired, Philip's concern was not so much about the timing but the decision to publicly discuss private family matters, a stance rooted in his lifelong belief in the importance of public service over personal popularity.

"Philip always advised his family to avoid the media's spotlight and not to focus on oneself," said Gyles Brandreth, a biographer close to the royal family. "He believed in duty and service above all else."

Philip, who died on April 9 at the age of 99, was notably proud of Harry's military service and his appointment as Captain General of the Royal Marines. This pride in his grandson's achievements highlights the complexity of Philip's feelings toward Harry's new life path.

The decision for Harry and Meghan to step back from senior royal duties and pursue independent careers was ultimately agreed upon by the queen, Prince Charles, and Prince William. This move was motivated by the couple's desire to forge their own philanthropic identities, separate from the confines of traditional royal responsibilities.

Their interview with Winfrey aired a series of grievances against the royal family, including allegations of neglect and racist treatment towards Meghan, who is biracial. These allegations have sent shockwaves through the monarchy and its global audience, sparking debates about the institution's future and its relationship with the public and the media.

As the royal family prepares for Prince Philip's funeral service at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, all eyes are on Prince Harry, who returned to the U.K. for the occasion without Meghan. The Duchess of Sussex, pregnant with the couple's second child, remained in California on doctor's advice.

Harry's presence at the funeral marks the first time he has joined the royal family since stepping down from his royal duties. This has sparked widespread speculation about potential reconciliation efforts within the family, especially between Harry and his brother William. With the brothers set to reunite in mourning for their grandfather, observers are watchful for signs of healing after a tumultuous period.

The upcoming funeral, while a somber occasion, serves as a backdrop for potentially significant familial interactions. As the world watches, many hope that the legacy of service and duty Prince Philip embodied may pave the way for unity and understanding within the royal family.
