Rust Tragedy: Inside the Role of Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and Mentorship by Gun Expert

In a tragic incident that has gripped Hollywood and sparked an urgent conversation about on-set safety protocols, Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed finds herself under scrutiny following the accidental shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins by actor Alec Baldwin. As details unfold, the mentorship of Gutierrez-Reed by seasoned gun expert Seth Kenney emerges as a crucial element in understanding the complex layers of responsibility and preparation behind the scenes.

Kenney, who owns a weapon and prop rental company, played a significant role in Gutierrez-Reed's career, acting as her 'armorer mentor'. His company not only provided the firearms but also supplied most of the ammunition used on the Rust set. It was Kenney who recommended Gutierrez-Reed for the armorer position on the movie, and his company supplied the Colt .45 revolver Baldwin was using when the tragic accident occurred.

Jason Bowles, attorney for Gutierrez-Reed, ardently defends his client's focus on safety. "Hannah was extremely safety conscious and has never expected live rounds to be present on set," explains Bowles. Gutierrez-Reed has maintained that she inspected the rounds to confirm they were 'dummies' and ensured the guns were securely locked up, a procedure she claims to have followed diligently on the day of the shooting as well.

However, the presence of a live round on set, which led to the fatal incident, starkly contradicts Gutierrez-Reed's assurances. Sheriff Adan Mendoza of the Santa Fe County expressed his skepticism, stating, "The discovery of a live round on set directly challenges Gutierrez-Reed's assertion of a live round-free environment, an assertion we found to be incorrect."

Amid these conflicting declarations, spokesperson for the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office, Juan Ríos, highlighted the ongoing nature of the investigation and refrained from commenting on the Los Angeles Times's reporting regarding Kenney and Gutierrez-Reed's involvement.

Despite Gutierrez-Reed's efforts to adhere to safety protocols, including her claim that no live ammunition was ever intentionally brought onto the Rust set, the unexpected find of a live round disrupts this narrative and raises questions about the oversight and management of weapons on set.

The filming of Rust has been suspended as the investigation continues, leaving many unanswered questions. While no charges have been filed yet, the industry, the public, and authorities are eagerly awaiting the results of the investigation, hoping it will shed light on how such a boundary of trust and safety was tragically breached.

This incident has not only led to a tragic loss of life but also ignited a broader dialogue on the necessity of stringent safety measures and professional competencies in handling firearms on film sets. As the film community mourns, it also faces a critical moment of introspection and potential reform to prevent such tragedies in the future.
