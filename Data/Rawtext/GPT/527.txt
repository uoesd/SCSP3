Union County Residents Get Extended Deadline for FEMA Hurricane Ida Assistance

Union County, NJ – Time is still on the side of Union County residents impacted by Hurricane Ida, as they now have until January 5, 2022, to apply for individual assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In an announcement that brings a sigh of relief to many, the FEMA Disaster Recovery Center in Union County will also remain open indefinitely for in-person assistance.

Commissioner Board Chairman Alexander Mirabella highlighted the significance of this extension, stating, "The extension for FEMA disaster assistance applications is crucial for our community. It ensures that Union County residents have ample time to apply for the federal support they need to recover from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Ida."

The FEMA Disaster Recovery Center, situated at the O'Donnell Dempsey Senior Community Center in Elizabeth, NJ, serves as a critical point of contact for individuals seeking assistance. To accommodate the needs of the community, the center operates Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., and Saturdays from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., providing a wide range of services to those affected.

Federal disaster assistance can offer a lifeline to residents in the form of financial aid for rent, essential home repairs, and other necessary expenses not covered by insurance. Understanding the urgency of these needs, FEMA encourages individuals to apply for assistance as soon as possible.

Applications for disaster assistance can be submitted through various convenient methods, including online at FEMA's official website, via the FEMA app, or by calling the FEMA Helpline. This range of options ensures that all residents have the opportunity to request the aid they require.

In addition to FEMA's direct assistance, free legal services are available to Union County residents facing legal challenges as a result of Hurricane Ida. These services are designed to help individuals navigate benefits, insurance claims, document replacement, and provide counseling on financial issues that have arisen due to the hurricane's impact.

Union County is among the 12 New Jersey counties that have been designated for FEMA disaster relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida. This designation underscores the severity of the storm's impact on the community and the extensive recovery efforts that are still underway.

As Union County continues to rebuild, the availability of FEMA assistance and legal services offers a beacon of hope to those still grappling with the consequences of Hurricane Ida. Residents are encouraged to take advantage of these resources to help them move forward from the challenges they have faced.
