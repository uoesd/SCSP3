New York State Imposes COVID-19 Vaccination Mandate for Healthcare Workers

In a significant move aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, especially the highly contagious Delta variant, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced today a comprehensive mandate requiring all healthcare workers in New York State to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by September 27. The mandate encompasses staff across a wide range of healthcare settings, including hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, adult care, and other congregate care situations.

In support of this directive, the State Department of Health will issue Section 16 Orders to facilitate the development and execution of mandatory vaccination policies within these healthcare institutions. This step underscores the state's commitment to ensuring the highest possible levels of vaccination among those at the forefront of patient care and vulnerable populations.

Understanding the diverse nature of the populace, exceptions to the mandate will be permitted for individuals who present legitimate medical or religious reasons. This ensures that the directive remains both inclusive and respectful of individual beliefs and medical circumstances.

Governor Cuomo revealed that, as of now, vaccination rates among healthcare workers in the state show variation across settings, with 75% of hospital workers, 74% of adult care facility workers, and 68% of nursing home workers already vaccinated. Nevertheless, the objective is to achieve near-universal vaccination rates among healthcare personnel to safeguard both the workforce and the public at large.

In a related appeal, Governor Cuomo encouraged private businesses to adopt vaccinated-only entry policies and urged school districts across the state to consider implementing vaccination mandates for eligible students and staff. The Governor's calls align with broader strategies to maximize vaccination rates and foster environments where individuals feel safer, contributing significantly to the state's recovery efforts.

Aligned with new scientific advisories, the state has begun offering a third COVID-19 vaccine dose to New Yorkers with compromised immune systems. This initiative follows closely on the heels of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s recommendation and is intended for individuals with severely weakened immune systems, such as those undergoing cancer treatment, organ transplant recipients, and others at heightened risk.

Highlighting the importance of this measure, Governor Cuomo stated, "In line with CDC guidance, we are taking decisive action to protect our most vulnerable populations. Offering a third COVID-19 vaccine dose to New Yorkers with compromised immune systems is a critical step in our fight against this relentless virus."

Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul added, "The vaccination mandate for healthcare workers is an essential step in New York State's ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19 and protect our communities. Vaccinations are our best weapon in this battle, and I commend healthcare workers across the state for leading by example."

New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker provided further clarity: "The decision to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for healthcare workers is grounded in scientific evidence and public health principles. It is crucial for those in healthcare settings, who are in close contact with vulnerable populations, to be vaccinated. This measure, along with the authorization of a third vaccine dose for individuals with compromised immune systems, is based on the latest scientific guidance and aims to safeguard health and prevent further spread of the virus."

New Yorkers with compromised immune systems are advised to consult with their healthcare provider about the suitability of receiving an additional vaccine dose to ensure optimal protection against COVID-19.

In concluding remarks, Governor Cuomo emphasized the significance of these measures, stating, "We are taking these bold steps, following scientific guidance and data, to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and the Delta variant. The vaccination mandate for healthcare workers, together with promoting widespread vaccine uptake among the public and specific interventions for immunocompromised New Yorkers, underscores our unwavering commitment to public health and safety."

These initiatives represent a comprehensive approach to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in New York State, reinforcing the importance of vaccination as the most effective tool in the fight against the pandemic. The state continues to urge all eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated, adhering to the proven strategies that will lead us through these challenging times.
