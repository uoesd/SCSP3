Tragic Strike: Kabul Airport Attack Kills Dozens, Including U.S. Service Members

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) – In a devastating act of terror, two suicide bombers accompanied by gunmen targeted crowds thronging Kabul's airport, resulting in the death of at least 60 Afghan civilians and 13 U.S. troops, marking one of the deadliest days in the two-decade-long Afghan conflict for American forces. The assault, occurring amidst frantic evacuation efforts following the Taliban's swift return to power, was promptly claimed by the Islamic State group, igniting global condemnation and a stern vow of retaliation from U.S. President Joe Biden.

"We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay," President Biden declared, addressing the nation and sending a chilling message to the perpetrators. Amidst the mourning, the resolve to continue the evacuation mission was echoed by Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, asserting the commitment to the ongoing airlift operations. "The threat from ISIS is extremely real. We've been talking about this for several days; we saw it actually manifest itself in the last few hours with an actual attack," McKenzie stated.

Despite the barbaric attack, the Taliban, now controlling the Afghan capital, denounced the blasts and distanced themselves, with spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid conveying their condemnation and emphasizing their non-involvement. The aftermath of the explosions saw more than 140 Afghans wounded, with an Italian charity, Emergency, scrambling to provide medical care. "Our surgical center had 60 patients arrive in a few hours. The toll is terrible," reported Marco Puntin, Emergency's manager in Afghanistan.

As news of the attack spread, countries renewed their cautions against approaching Kabul airport, citing severe security threats. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby, alongside Gen. McKenzie, acknowledged that a "complex attack" had breached airport defences, underlining the precariousness of the situation. Acting U.S. ambassador to Kabul, Ross Wilson, reiterated the security risks, urging Americans and allies to heed advice against traveling to the airport.

The ruthless airport assault, unraveling against the backdrop of the impending U.S. withdrawal deadline of August 31, underscores the volatile landscape in Afghanistan, raising profound questions about the future security and stability of the country in the aftermath of the foreign troops' departure.
