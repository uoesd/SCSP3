Wisconsin Democrats Push for Stricter Gun Laws for Minors

MADISON, Wis. (CBS 58) – In a move to tighten gun control within the state, Democratic lawmakers from Kenosha have introduced a comprehensive bill aimed at revising Wisconsin's gun regulations concerning minors. The proposed legislation seeks to significantly restrict minors from possessing long guns or rifles unless they are engaged in legal hunting activities.

This legislative effort comes in the wake of the controversial case involving Kyle Rittenhouse, who, during the 2020 Kenosha unrest, carried a semiautomatic rifle at the young age of 17. Rittenhouse was later acquitted of all charges, including homicide and reckless endangerment, after a high-profile trial. A significant point of contention during the trial was the decision by the presiding judge to drop the charge related to underage possession of a firearm, citing a loophole in the existing law.

State Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) voiced strong support for the bill, emphasizing the need for updated legislation to prevent similar scenarios in the future. "An adolescent wandering our streets with a loaded AR-15 is not the image of freedom; it's a clear and present danger to public safety," Larson stated. "Our bill intends to close this dangerous loophole, ensuring that the law explicitly prevents minors from carrying firearms in public spaces without a valid reason."

Opposition to the bill comes from Republican lawmakers, who argue that the proposed changes could infringe upon Second Amendment rights. State Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) expressed concerns over the potential impact of such legislation, particularly on school rifle clubs. "We must be cautious not to trample on the rights of law-abiding citizens and jeopardize our rich traditions, including educational rifle programs that promote safety and responsibility," Testin remarked.

The Democratic initiative doesn't stop at restricting gun possession by minors. In an effort to further enhance public safety, Democrats have also introduced a package of bills focusing on safer gun storage and the mandatory reporting of lost or stolen firearms. The 'Safe Storage for Gun Safety' plan is designed to mitigate gun violence and prevent accidental shootings by promoting responsible gun ownership.

Rep. Tod Ohnstad (D-Kenosha), one of the proponents of the legislation, highlighted the importance of these measures for community well-being. "Safe gun storage is a simple yet effective way to prevent tragic accidents and deter theft. It's about keeping our children and communities safe," Ohnstad explained.

Supporting the comprehensive approach to gun safety, Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) expressed her advocacy for the reporting requirement for lost or stolen guns. "This isn't just about compliance; it's about accountability. Reporting lost or stolen firearms can significantly assist law enforcement in their efforts to combat gun trafficking and prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands," Subeck noted.

However, the chances of these bills passing the Republican-controlled Legislature appear slim. Previous attempts at introducing gun control legislation have been met with resistance, and the current proposals are unlikely to be an exception. Despite the anticipated opposition, Democratic lawmakers remain committed to advocating for what they believe will contribute to a safer Wisconsin.

The broader conversation around these bills reflects the ongoing national debate over gun control and Second Amendment rights. With public safety concerns at the forefront, the proposed legislation by Wisconsin Democrats brings to light the complexities and challenges of navigating gun laws in a deeply divided political landscape. As the discussion progresses, the balance between ensuring public safety and protecting constitutional rights continues to be a contentious and polarizing issue.

As the legislative process unfolds, stakeholders from all sides of the debate are expected to weigh in, highlighting the deep divisions and contrasting perspectives on how best to address gun violence and firearm possession by minors. Regardless of the outcome, the proposed changes underscore the ongoing efforts by legislators to confront and address the nuances of gun control in the aim of securing a safer environment for all Wisconsin residents.
