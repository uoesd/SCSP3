These teams not only performed the emergency surgery but also looked after him during his subsequent hospital stay, playing a critical role in his current state of recovery.

Woods' focus is now firmly on his rehabilitation, a process that is bound to be challenging yet crucial for his potential return to golf. The golfing community and sports world at large are watching closely, hopeful for a recovery that would see one of the sport's greatest icons make a return to the greens. However, it's understood that Woods' main priority remains his health and well-being, not rushing a return to the professional realm.
