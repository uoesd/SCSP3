Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Shine as They Navigate Life in the Spotlight with Grace and Unity

In an exclusive reveal, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry readied themselves for a dazzling gala evening, once again turning to their trusted wedding glam squad. Celebrated makeup artist Daniel Martin, a dear friend of the couple, opened up to PEOPLE Royals about the dynamic duo's radiance and joyful presence.

Martin, who has been a key figure behind Meghan's iconic looks, shared, "Their spirits are truly infectious. There's always laughter and joy when they're around, which makes any occasion with them feel special." It's this sense of happiness and unity that fans and friends alike have come to adore in the couple.

Meghan Markle has been captivating audiences with her recent appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and alongside Prince Harry during their visit to New York City. The couple's active public life continues to draw attention, underlining their commitment to making an impact while navigating their new life outside of the British Royal Family.

Since stepping back as senior working royals, Meghan and Harry have embarked on a journey towards financial independence, setting their roots in California. This transition has allowed them to carve out a more personal and meaningful existence, focusing on the issues closest to their hearts.

As a family of four, with their children Archie and Lili, life in the US has brought new joys and challenges. Meghan, in particular, has championed the cause of paid parental leave in the US, stressing the importance of a balanced work-life dynamic for all families.

Prince Harry, on his part, has been vocal in his battle against misinformation and disinformation, a cause that has gained significant momentum in recent years. Additionally, Harry has openly criticized the term 'Megxit', highlighting the misogynistic undertones and how its propagation has affected both him and Meghan.

As the couple faces their second year of independence, they continue to rely on each other's strength and companionship. "They are truly inseparable," shared hairstylist Serge Normant, who has worked closely with Meghan. "Despite the challenges, they manage to find happiness and a deep sense of contentment in their life together."

Martin echoed this sentiment, noting, "They are in every sense of the word, a team. It's beautiful to see how they support each other through thick and thin. Together, they're unstoppable."

As Meghan and Harry prepare for future endeavors, their story remains one of unity, resilience, and an ever-present hope for a better tomorrow. Their bond, not just as a couple but as a family, stands as a testament to their love and the life they are building together.
