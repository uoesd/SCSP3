Israeli Film Industry Confident in Prop Gun Safety Standards

In the wake of the tragic shooting incident on the set of "Rust" involving actor Alec Baldwin, attention has turned to the safety measures surrounding the use of prop guns in film productions worldwide. Within the Israeli film industry, however, professionals maintain a stance that such an incident is unlikely to ever occur in their domain. This confidence is deeply rooted in a culture of firearm respect and knowledge, thanks in part to the country's compulsory military service.

Veteran Israeli director Avi Nesher, with decades of experience in the film industry, underscored this sentiment by highlighting the extensive safety measures and training that are a staple of his and many of his colleagues' sets. "Every time we intend to use a prop gun, we go through rigorous safety protocols. It's not just about keeping the set safe; it's about ingraining a level of respect for what these weapons represent," Nesher explained.

This respect and familiarity with firearms, as a consequence of Israel's compulsory military service, have fostered a unique culture of safety within the Israeli filmmaking community. Industry insiders unanimously agree that this cultural approach is a cornerstone in preventing accidents on set. It is a significant factor contributing to the fact that there have been no incidents in Israel of someone being shot with a prop gun during movie production.

A standard safety protocol in the Israeli film industry involves strict rules about not allowing anyone in the line of fire, even during rehearsals. In many cases, directors use "finger guns" during the initial stages to completely eliminate the risk. This practice contrasts sharply with some of the criticisms leveled at how prop guns are managed in the American film industry, where a lack of real firearms knowledge has been highlighted.

Tobias Hochstein, an Ophir Award-winning cinematographer, expressed profound sadness over the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of "Rust." "It was a heartbreaking incident that shouldn't have happened. Here, we always put safety first, with every crew member aware and trained on the potential risks involved with prop guns," Hochstein remarked.

Director Kobi Machat also weighed in on the importance of disciplined safety practices concerning prop guns. "In Israel, we have a very disciplined approach to handling firearms, real or props. This discipline extends to our film sets, ensuring that everyone from actors to stagehands understands the seriousness of what we're dealing with," Machat stated.

Moreover, the generally lower budgets in Israeli films compared to their American counterparts inadvertently contribute to a safer environment concerning prop guns. With fewer people involved in the process, the potential for accidents diminishes as tighter control over the set and its activities is more manageable. It's a perspective shared by many in the industry, highlighting that while budget constraints can be challenging, they also enforce a streamlined approach to safety.

Indeed, the Israeli film industry's inherent respect for firearms, forged by military service and cultural norms, sets a high bar for prop gun safety protocols. This baseline of knowledge and respect seems to be the missing link in other film industries struggling with on-set safety.

As international discussions continue on how to prevent tragic accidents like the one involving Alec Baldwin, the Israeli film industry stands as a testament to the effectiveness of rigorous safety measures, disciplined approaches, and a deep-seated respect for the tools of their trade. The professionals within it hope their practices can offer lessons to filmmakers around the world on maintaining the highest safety standards while continuing to create compelling cinema.
