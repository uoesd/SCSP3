Biden Administration Prepares to Vaccinate Children Ages 5-11, Ensuring Access and Convenience

In a significant step forward in the fight against COVID-19, the Biden Administration has announced its comprehensive plan to make vaccinations for children ages 5-11 convenient, accessible, and free of charge, pending authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This announcement comes at a critical time as the administration underscores its dedication to safeguarding the health of the nation's youth amidst the ongoing pandemic.

As of now, the United States has seen substantial progress in its vaccination efforts, with two in three eligible individuals, totaling 189 million Americans, fully vaccinated — a remarkable increase from the 2 million individuals vaccinated at the start of President Biden's tenure. This achievement reflects the administration's commitment to controlling the pandemic through widespread vaccination.

Anticipating the potential authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5-11 by the FDA and CDC, the administration is gearing up to implement a well-structured distribution plan. This plan prioritizes the health and safety of children, ensuring their inclusion in the national vaccination effort as soon as possible, following the independent and rigorous review by the FDA and CDC. Vaccination efforts will begin shortly after a final recommendation is made by the CDC, underscoring the administration's readiness to protect this younger age group.

A collaborative approach will characterize the vaccine rollout, with states, tribes, and territories playing a pivotal role, supported by federal funding to ensure full reimbursement for vaccination operations. The administration has proactively secured enough vaccine doses to cover the country's 28 million children in this age group, demonstrating foresight and readiness to act swiftly upon FDA authorization.

To maximize accessibility and convenience for families, the administration is establishing vaccination sites across a variety of settings, including doctors' offices, hospitals, pharmacies, community health centers, and both school- and community-based sites. A network of over 25,000 pediatric and primary care providers will offer vaccinations, and efforts are underway to expand this provider base even further.

In a noteworthy partnership, the Administration is joining forces with the Children's Hospital Association to establish vaccination sites in more than 100 children's hospital systems nationwide. This collaboration aims to offer vaccinations in trusted, family-friendly environments, ensuring parents and children have access to vaccines in settings they know and trust. Additionally, these hospitals will play a crucial role in providing accurate and reassuring information to parents, helping to address concerns and questions about the vaccine.

The Biden Administration is steadfast in its commitment to make COVID-19 vaccinations accessible to all Americans, including the youngest and most vulnerable members of our community. This comprehensive plan underscores the administration's dedication to public health and the well-being of children nationwide, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing effort to bring the pandemic to an end.
