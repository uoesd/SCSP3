Gun Experts Linked to Fatal 'Rust' Set Incident Face Scrutiny

In a gripping turn of events that has captured the nation's attention, the 'Rust' movie set tragedy, where actor Alec Baldwin fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza, has unmasked the intricate responsibilities and risks associated with handling firearms in filmmaking. Central to the investigation are Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the gun expert on set, and Seth Kenney, an Arizona-based gun expert who played a pivotal role as an 'armorer mentor' to Gutierrez Reed during the ill-fated production.

Kenney's involvement goes beyond mentorship. His company was responsible for supplying the firearms used on the 'Rust' set, including the Colt .45 revolver Baldwin handled during the tragic incident. It was Kenney who recommended Gutierrez Reed for the position of armorer on 'Rust', a decision now under stark scrutiny as authorities and the public alike demand answers.

However, the investigation reveals murky details about the ammunition supplied by Kenney and his actual presence on the set, raising questions about the oversight and safety protocols followed during the production. The live round that resulted in Hutchins's death and Souza's injury was never supposed to be on the set, with the cast and crew believing the gun to be "cold" - a term used to indicate that a firearm is safe and unloaded.

In a striking twist, Gutierrez Reed's legal team has floated the theory of possible 'sabotage', suggesting that the live bullet could have been intentionally placed among the prop ammunition. This claim, although yet to be substantiated, adds a layer of mystery and conspiracy to an already complex case.

Compounding concerns are reports from Gutierrez Reed's past, indicating a pattern of questionable firearm handling. During the filming of 'The Old Way' with Nicolas Cage, key grip Stu Brumbaugh observed incidents that raised eyebrows. "There was a lack of professionalism I hadn't seen before," Brumbaugh noted, highlighting an instance where Cage walked off set in frustration after Gutierrez Reed discharged a firearm without warning.

Kenney, with a background working with major prop houses and as a film weapons consultant, finds his reputation and career under a microscope as the investigation unfolds. His connection to the 'Rust' tragedy places him at the intersection of industry standards and personal accountability in ensuring the safe use of firearms on set.

As the film industry grapples with the aftermath of this incident, questions about safety protocols, accountability, and the complexities of using real firearms in filmmaking linger. The tragic loss of Halyna Hutchins serves as a stark reminder of the real-world consequences when things go tragically wrong on the set.
