The Emmy Awards, recognized as the pinnacle of achievement in US television, celebrate the exceptional talents and productions that define the industry.

In response, Buckingham Palace released a statement expressing the Queen's sadness over the revelations and noted that "recollections may vary," indicating a discrepancy in the royal family's memory of events.

In the broader realm of television recognition, "The Crown" and "The Mandalorian" have taken the lead with 24 nominations each, highlighting a diverse and rich year for television production.
