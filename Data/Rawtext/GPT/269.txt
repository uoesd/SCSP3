France Advises Against Moderna Vaccine for Under 30s Over Myocarditis Risk

In a pivotal move, the French health authority, Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS), has urged caution with the use of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax, for individuals under 30. This recommendation comes amid concerns over the 'very rare' risk of myocarditis - a heart inflammation condition - associated with the vaccine.

HAS's latest guidance is informed by recent data, including findings from a French study released on Monday. It underscores that the risk of myocarditis among the under-30 demographic is significantly lower with Pfizer's Comirnaty jab, being five times less likely than with Moderna's offering.

This advisory comes despite the European Union's drug watchdog, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), recently green-lighting Moderna's booster vaccine for all individuals over 18, to be administered six months following the second dose. While EMA did identify a potential connection between rare inflammatory heart conditions and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines - including those developed by Pfizer and Moderna - it firmly believes the vaccines' benefits in preventing COVID-19 infections outweigh the identified risks.

HAS's current stance involves discouraging the use of Moderna's vaccine as a first, second, or booster shot among those under 30, citing a preference for the Pfizer vaccine within this age group due to its safety profile. Conversely, for individuals over 30, HAS points to Moderna's slightly enhanced effectiveness in recommending its use.

The recommendation is set to hold until further scientific data becomes available. It aligns with broader international consensus, including from U.S. regulators and the World Health Organization, which continues to support the overall benefits of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines amidst their widespread global deployment.
