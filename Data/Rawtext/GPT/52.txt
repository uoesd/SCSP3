House Votes to Create Commission on Jan. 6 Capitol Attack, Faces Senate Hurdle

WASHINGTON, May 19 – In a significant legislative move, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to establish an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The bill, which now proceeds to the Senate, saw bipartisan support with 35 Republicans breaking ranks to vote in favor despite concerted efforts from leadership to block the measure.

The proposed commission is designed to mirror the structure of the 9/11 Commission, aiming to provide a comprehensive assessment of the events leading up to, during, and following the Capitol siege, including an evaluation of law enforcement and security failures. Its objective is to compile a detailed report complete with recommendations to prevent future attacks on the nation's democratic processes.

Despite the bipartisan support in the House, the bill's future in the Senate remains uncertain. Both House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell have expressed strong opposition to the commission. McConnell criticized the proposal, asserting, "I've made the decision to oppose the House Democrats' slanted and unbalanced proposal for another commission to study the events of January 6."

Addressing the press, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer highlighted that McCarthy's requested compromises on the commission's structure had been met, stating, "It's perplexing why he changed his mind about his own suggestions that were adopted."

McConnell, on the other hand, suggested that the ongoing congressional investigations and prosecutorial efforts were sufficient, dismissing the need for an additional commission. "We have significant investigations already underway, led by both Democrats and Republicans, which are appropriate and capable of getting to the truth," McConnell remarked.

Should the Senate block the creation of the commission, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated that the House would continue its investigation through regular committee hearings. Pelosi emphasized the need for accountability, saying, "We will find the truth. If they don't want to do this, we will."

The bill received critical support from a number of Republicans who see the commission as a vital step toward understanding and rectifying the security and intelligence oversights that permitted the Capitol attack to occur. Notably, Republican Representative John Katko, who played a key role in negotiating the bill, expressed, "We must get to the bottom of this and ensure it never happens again."

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, voiced his support for the commission, urging colleagues to rise above partisanship, "We have a duty to the Constitution and the American people to find the truth of Jan. 6 and ensure that such an assault on our democracy never happens again."

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has pledged to bring the bill to the Senate floor for a vote, calling upon Republicans to demonstrate their commitment to democracy. "I will put the Jan. 6 commission legislation on the floor of the Senate for a vote, period. Republicans can let their constituents know where they stand," Schumer stated.

Republican Senator Susan Collins has expressed openness to supporting the commission, suggesting potential modifications to enhance its bipartisan appeal. Collins emphasized the importance of an impartial investigation, "A commission is crucial to gaining a complete understanding of the most severe attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812."

However, some Republicans, including Senators John Cornyn and Mitch McConnell, have voiced concerns over the commission's potential impact on the 2022 midterm elections, suggesting it could be wielded as a political weapon against them.

Democratic Representative Zoe Lofgren, chair of the House Administration Committee, criticized the opposition, underlining the necessity of a thorough investigation. "We are committed to uncovering the truth behind the insurrection and ensuring such a breach of our democratic institutions never occurs again," Lofgren stated.

Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene echoed former President Donald Trump's sentiments by labeling the commission a "trap" orchestrated by Democrats. Trump had earlier called on Republicans to oppose the commission, framing it as an extension of the left's attempts to vilify him and his supporters.

As the bill heads to the Senate, the nation watches closely. The establishment of the commission not only seeks answers about the January 6 attack but also represents a broader struggle for the soul of American democracy and the lengths to which its leaders are willing to go to protect it.
