Taliban Negotiate with Qatar and Turkey Over Kabul Airport Management

The Taliban are currently in negotiations with Qatar and Turkey to oversee the management of Kabul's airport, a critical hub that has been at the center of evacuation efforts since the US withdrawal. This move aims to restart commercial flights, providing a crucial exit route for those seeking to leave Afghanistan.

The discussions are focused on ensuring that Kabul airport can safely facilitate commercial traffic, amidst the turmoil following the departure of US forces. The need for secure and accessible airport facilities has been underlined by global leaders, including French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. "The priority is to have a functional airport," Le Drian stated, emphasizing the international community's push for stability in Afghanistan's air travel infrastructure.

The collapse of Afghanistan's civil aviation capacity came in the wake of the US's chaotic withdrawal, which left Kabul airport severely handicapped, lacking proper air traffic control services. In response, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a stern directive, barring American civil aircraft from flying over Afghan airspace unless they obtain prior authorization. This decision was driven by ongoing security concerns and the absence of a functional civil aviation authority in the country.

During the height of the evacuation crisis, the US military briefly assumed control over air traffic management in Kabul, facilitating the exodus of tens of thousands of people from Afghanistan. However, with the military's departure, the challenge of maintaining safe skies has intensified.

For civil operators in the US, a high-altitude jet route near Afghanistan's eastern border remains available, but only with explicit FAA approval. Initially, during the evacuation phase, the FAA had relaxed its rules slightly, allowing US air carriers and civilian pilots to fly into Kabul for evacuation or relief efforts, provided they had the green light from the US Defense Department.

American airlines have played a significant part in these efforts, albeit operating from airbases and airports outside Afghanistan. This international endeavor continues to emphasize the global community's focus on ensuring that Afghanistan can maintain a connection to the outside world through air travel, despite the present challenges.
