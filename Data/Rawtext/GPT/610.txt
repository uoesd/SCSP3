Vice President Harris Launches Nationwide Effort to Transform Maternal Health and Equity

In a significant move to tackle the nation's maternal health crisis, Vice President Kamala Harris has announced a comprehensive Call to Action aimed at improving maternal health outcomes and reducing mortality rates across the United States. This initiative, part of the broader strategy by the Biden-Harris Administration, seeks to address the stark disparities in maternal morbidity, especially among Black and Native American women, and to ensure equitable healthcare access for all mothers and babies.

Central to this initiative is the proposal from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for a new "Birthing-Friendly" hospital designation. This pioneering proposal is designed to elevate the standards of maternal care nationwide. Furthermore, CMS has issued guidance supporting year-long Medicaid postpartum coverage, a move that could drastically improve health outcomes for new mothers. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) underscores the potential of this expansion, estimating that around 720,000 more individuals could gain access to Medicaid postpartum coverage if all states embrace the extended duration.

In response to the pressing need for action, the Biden-Harris Administration recognized the first-ever White House Maternal Health Day of Action. This milestone event spotlighted the urgency of addressing maternal health issues and announced new commitments under the Build Back Better Act to fortify the foundation of maternal healthcare in America. The Administration's proposal includes a robust $3 billion investment in maternal health initiatives, focusing on enhancing workforce diversity, advancing research, improving social determinants of health, and strengthening care coordination and coverage.

In alignment with these commitments, states are being urged to extend Medicaid coverage to 12 months postpartum, significantly augmenting the current 60-day coverage period. This extension is crucial, given a new HHS report that showcases the myriad benefits of a full year of postpartum Medicaid coverage. The report highlights how such an extension could serve as a lifeline for thousands of families, ensuring mothers have the access to necessary healthcare services during the critical postpartum period.

The United States stands out for having the highest maternal mortality rate among affluent nations, a rate that has alarmingly increased over the past two decades. This problem is particularly acute among Black and Native American women, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. Vice President Harris has been a longstanding proponent of enhancing maternal healthcare, having championed legislation such as the Maternal CARE Act and the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act, aimed at bridging these gaps.

Through this nationwide Call to Action and the initiatives it encompasses, the Biden-Harris Administration reaffirms its dedication to transforming maternal health and ensuring that every mother in the United States has access to the care and support she deserves. This concerted effort marks a pivotal step towards rectifying long-standing inequities in healthcare and actualizing a vision for a healthier, more equitable future for all families.
