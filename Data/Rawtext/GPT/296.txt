California Marks One-Year Anniversary of Vaccine Milestone and Urges Continued Vigilance Against COVID-19

SACRAMENTO – Today, the State of California commemorates the one-year anniversary of the first COVID-19 vaccine administered within the state, a pivotal moment that signaled the beginning of the end in the fight against the pandemic. In reflection of this significant milestone, Governor Gavin Newsom took the opportunity to publish an ethnic media column, calling on Californians to continue their efforts in maintaining strong immunity against the virus through timely vaccinations and booster shots.

Since the rollout of the vaccines, California has administered over 62.7 million doses, with 86% of all eligible Californians having received at least one dose, and more than 6 million adults have bolstered their protection with a COVID-19 booster shot. Governor Newsom emphasized the critical role that vaccines play in curbing the spread of the virus and protecting the state's most vulnerable populations, stating, "Vaccination is our most powerful tool in the fight against COVID-19. Through widespread vaccinations, we have the capacity to slow the spread of the virus, safeguard our communities, and ensure that our healthcare system can manage the ongoing impacts of the pandemic."

Early in the pandemic, California led the nation by implementing first-in-the-nation vaccine measures, setting mandatory vaccination protocols for healthcare workers and establishing school attendance requirements to ensure the safety and well-being of students and staff alike. Furthermore, the state has fostered partnerships with over 830 faith-based and community organizations in an effort to enhance vaccination equity and expand outreach to those in hard-to-reach communities.

In response to the rising case rates and hospitalizations, Newsom announced new state guidance that introduces universal indoor mask mandates, regardless of vaccination status, along with revised mega event and travel advisories. These measures underscore the ongoing commitment to public health and safety amidst the pandemic.

Importantly, COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots are provided free of charge for all Californians, irrespective of insurance or immigration status. Governor Newsom strongly urges all eligible residents to take advantage of this critical resource, stressing, "With the availability of vaccines and booster shots to all Californians at no cost, there has never been a better time to get vaccinated. As we face rising case rates and hospitalizations, it's crucial that we all do our part to protect ourselves and each other."

As California marks this one-year anniversary of vaccine administration, the message from Governor Newsom is clear: vaccination remains key to moving past the pandemic, and every Californian plays a vital role in achieving statewide immunity and returning to normalcy.
