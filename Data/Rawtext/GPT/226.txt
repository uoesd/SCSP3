Fuel Frenzy: Drivers Ignore Warnings Amid Pipeline Shutdown

ATLANTA, May 12 (Reuters) – In the wake of a significant pipeline closure, Southeast U.S. drivers are overlooking government appeals to avoid hoarding gasoline, leading to widespread shortages and chaos at gas stations. With the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline due to a ransomware attack, stations across several states are grappling with demand that has substantially exceeded supply, resulting in long queues and even physical altercations.

Despite repeated messages from officials to maintain normal consumption patterns, the situation has escalated. "Every gas station I passed was either out of fuel or had a line 10 cars deep," said Ronald Ross, a DoorDash driver in Atlanta, illustrating the desperation many are feeling. Ross, like many others, has been struggling to find fuel for his vehicle, emphasizing the dire circumstances for those reliant on driving for their livelihood.

James Jones, a contractor based in Atlanta, voiced his frustrations and fears. "It's been panic at the pumps. People are filling up whenever they can, wherever they can. I've seen fights break out over gas. It's getting out of hand," Jones shared, highlighting the social tensions the fuel shortages are causing in communities.

At the core of the crisis, nearly 60% of gas stations in metro Atlanta are devoid of gas, with figures soaring above 70% in cities such as Charlotte, Raleigh, and Pensacola, painting a grim picture of the fuel landscape. The scarcity is evident in the rising fuel prices, with the average national gasoline price peaking over $3.00 a gallon - a rate not seen since October 2014.

The Biden administration has cautioned against hoarding, going as far as to discourage the dangerous practice of filling plastic bags with gasoline. Despite these warnings, instances of people resorting to extremes to stockpile fuel have surfaced, underlining a widespread panic.

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp responded to the unfolding crisis by temporarily suspending gas taxes in a bid to mitigate price hikes, offering some relief to concerned drivers. However, the underlying issue of the pipeline shutdown looms large, emphasizing the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic's dependency on the Colonial Pipeline for their fuel needs.

Cherie Thomas, a manager at an Exxon Mobil station in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, explained the day-to-day challenges. "We get a shipment in and it's gone in a few hours. I've had more fights in the parking lot than I can count. People are scared, angry, and desperate," Thomas said, providing a glimpse into the frontline of the fuel shortage.

Amidst the chaos, industry experts are calling for calm. Rob Underwood, President of Energy Marketers of America, advocated for restraint, "We understand the panic, but we must urge drivers to stay calm. Hoarding does not help; it only exacerbates the situation. There's enough for everyone if we stick to our normal habits."

The Colonial Pipeline shutdown, initiated by a ransomware hack, has exposed the vulnerability of critical infrastructure and the cascading effects such a disruption can have on public behavior and economic stability. The pipeline, a vital vein for fuel distribution along the East Coast, remains offline as investigations and efforts to restore service continue.

Officials and industry leaders maintain that the best course of action is to avoid hoarding and to wait patiently for operations to normalize. Their message: staying calm and rational is the key to weathering this fuel shortage storm without further incident or exacerbation. However, with tensions high and fuel pumps dry, it remains a challenging ask for many.
