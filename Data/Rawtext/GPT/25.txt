In a monumental announcement, Sarah Fuller, the Vanderbilt kicker who made history in the world of college football, has been invited to take part in President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. Fuller, known for breaking barriers in sports, will grace an event that signals a new chapter in American history, underscoring the inauguration's theme of unity and progress.

The inauguration event, titled "Celebrating America," promises an evening filled with star-studded performances and inspirational messages. Hosted by acclaimed actor Tom Hanks, the primetime special aims to illuminate the resilience of the American spirit and the shared hope for a more united country.

Among the roster of renowned celebrities slated to appear are musical giants Foo Fighters, John Legend, and Bruce Springsteen. Their participation underscores the event's commitment to harnessing the power of art to heal and bring people together during these challenging times.

In addition to the musical performances, actresses Eva Longoria and Kerry Washington will take on the role of introducing segments throughout the evening.

Scheduled to air Wednesday night following Biden's swearing-in ceremony, the inauguration special is a much-anticipated event. It represents not just a political transition, but a cultural moment reflecting America's diversity and relentless optimism.

Sarah Fuller took to Twitter to express her excitement and honor in being part of this historic inauguration. Her involvement is particularly symbolic, representing the struggles and achievements of American women and girls in the realm of sports and beyond.

Fuller's message on Twitter was a rallying cry for female empowerment, encouraging women and girls to #LeadLikeAWoman. Her participation in the inauguration highlights the importance of female leadership and breaking glass ceilings in every field of endeavor.
