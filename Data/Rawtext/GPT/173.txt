Virginia Delegate Claims Mossad Behind 'Fossil Fuel Wars,' Prompting Criticism

ARLINGTON, Virginia – Controversial remarks by Virginia Democratic delegate Ibraheem Samirah accusing Israel's intelligence agency Mossad of engineering global conflicts have ignited a wave of criticism and scrutiny. Samirah, in a series of recent tweets, suggested Mossad's involvement in orchestrating 'fossil fuel wars,' including pivotal conflicts like the Iran-Iraq war and the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States.

The delegate's comments emerged as he expressed support for the Sunrise Movement's decision to boycott a rally due to the participation of Jewish movements with ties to Israel. In one of his posts, Samirah pointed to a Guardian article that he claimed alleged Mossad's role in creating such wars, although the article itself did not support his assertion.

Further stirring controversy, Samirah also implicated Israel in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war. He referenced a 1986 New York Times article detailing weapons deals between Israel and the Shah of Iran before the Islamic Revolution, attempting to draw connections to broader geopolitical maneuvers by Israel.

Amid his critique, Samirah addressed the conflation of Judaism with Zionism, labeling it a form of antisemitism. His stance has drawn varying responses, predominantly focusing on the political implications of his remarks. Republicans have been vocal in their criticism, particularly highlighting the Democratic Party's silence on the matter.

Boris Epshteyn, a Jewish adviser to former President Donald Trump, specifically questioned the lack of response from Jewish Democratic groups. "It's concerning to see such claims go unchallenged within the party. Silence in the face of such remarks is alarming," Epshteyn commented, reflecting a broader expectation for a more vociferous rebuttal of Samirah's assertions.

However, the Democratic Majority for Israel has somewhat distanced itself from Samirah's controversial opinions, noting his recent loss in a Democratic primary as an indication of where the party stands regarding his views.

Samirah, a Palestinian American who interrupted a rally by Donald Trump in 2019, has been a divisive figure in politics. His father, a noted Muslim activist, was deported in 2003 by the Bush administration, only to be ordered back to the U.S. by a judge a decade later, further entangling Samirah's personal history with his political narratives.
