GOP Challengers Target Incumbents Who Supported Trump Impeachment

In an unprecedented movement within the Republican Party, loyalists to former President Donald Trump are setting their sights on unseating GOP incumbents who voted in favor of Trump's second impeachment. Among those challengers are Chris Mathys and Jonah Schulz, who were galvanized by their targets' willingness to cross party lines and impeach or convict Trump.

This campaign season is shaping up to be a battleground for the soul of the GOP, as eleven out of the seventeen Republicans who supported Trump's impeachment are up for reelection in 2022. Significantly, forty Republicans have thrown their hats into the ring, filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to challenge the ten pro-impeachment GOP incumbents.

Trump's endorsements have become a pivotal factor in these races, with the former president selectively backing candidates poised to oust incumbents he deems unfaithful. "Our mission is to elect pro-Trump Republicans who will hold the line and advance America First policies," stated Chris Mathys, setting the tone for his campaign against Rep. David Valadao in California.

Traditionally, incumbents have a strong track record in primaries, but Trump is determined to change this dynamic, especially against those who voted against him. In Ohio, Trump has thrown his support behind Max Miller in his challenge against Rep. Anthony Gonzalez. "President Trump will be heavily involved in key races, bringing his enormous popularity and influence to bear," said Taylor Budowich, senior adviser to Miller's campaign.

South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice, who cast one of the most surprising votes for impeachment, now faces the most primary challengers, totaling eleven. Among those taking on impeachment-supporting incumbents is Catalina Lauf, who is challenging Rep. Adam Kinzinger in Illinois, criticizing him for "failing to honor the will of the people."

In Alaska, Trump has endorsed Kelly Tshibaka against Sen. Lisa Murkowski, pledging to actively campaign against the incumbent. Tshibaka's campaign adviser, Tim Murtaugh, highlighted the significance of Trump's backing, stating, "With President Trump's endorsement, Kelly represents the best path forward for Alaska and for our country."

This surge of pro-Trump candidates reflects a stark division within the GOP, as the party grapples with its identity and direction in the post-Trump era. The outcome of these primaries could redefine Republican politics for years to come, underscoring the lasting influence of Trump's presidency on the party's future.
