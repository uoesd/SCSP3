Clarifying the Royal Vows: Archbishop Sets Record Straight on Meghan and Harry's Wedding

CNN – In a revelation that has put to rest rampant speculation, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has confirmed that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were not legally married before their public ceremony, as had been claimed by the Duchess of Sussex. This announcement comes after Meghan Markle disclosed in a candid interview with Oprah Winfrey that she and Prince Harry had a private "exchange of vows" three days before the highly publicized event.

The private ceremony, described by Meghan, was a personal moment between her and Harry without any witnesses, which led to widespread conjecture about its legal legitimacy. Addressing the controversy, Archbishop Welby clarified, "The legal wedding was on the Saturday. I signed the wedding certificate, which is a legal document, and I would have committed a serious criminal offense if I signed it knowing it was false."

Held on May 19, 2018, the public and official ceremony took place at St. George's Chapel in Windsor, watched by millions around the globe. This confirmation underlines the significance of the formal occasion, as opposed to the private exchange of vows that occurred earlier.

The Archbishop of Canterbury's statement sheds light on the serious legal implications of signing a false wedding certificate. He emphatically stated, "So you can make what you like about it. But the legal wedding was on the Saturday."

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision to step back from royal duties in January of the previous year was a move that signaled their desire for a different life, one less encumbered by the traditional royal responsibilities and more focused on their own family and philanthropic efforts.

Their interview with Oprah Winfrey, a rare opportunity to speak more freely about their experiences within the royal family, was eye-opening. The couple discussed issues ranging from racism within the royal household to mental health struggles faced by Meghan during her time as a senior royal.

One of the most startling disclosures was the couple's assertion that there were concerns within the royal family about the skin color of their unborn child, Archie. This, among other revelations during the interview, highlighted the couple's difficulties and the reasons behind their unprecedented decision to relocate and step down from their royal duties.

As the Duke and Duchess of Sussex continue to chart their own path forward, their stories and experiences provide a rare glimpse into the complexities and challenges of modern royal life.
