Vistra Corp Raises Winter Storm Uri Cost Estimate to $1.6 Billion

April 26 – Vistra Corp announced on Monday a significant increase in the estimated costs associated with the February winter storm Uri, taking the figure up to approximately $1.6 billion. This new estimate is a sharp rise from the company's previous estimate range of $900 million to $1.3 billion. The company attributed this increase to additional expenses incurred during the storm, noting that the current estimate still excludes potential recoupments through legal and regulatory avenues.

In light of these revised figures, Vistra also reissued its financial guidance for the year 2021. The updated forecast includes an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) range of $1,475 to $1,875 million and an ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow range of $200 to $600 million. These revised estimates mark a significant downturn from the substantially higher EBITDA and free cash flow figures Vistra had projected for the year before the storm wreaked havoc on its operations.

Curt Morgan, the Chief Executive of Vistra, commented on the company's resilience during the crisis, saying, "Throughout the storm, Vistra generated more power than its market share, demonstrating our commitment to reliability and service. Unfortunately, unfulfilled gas contracts and the necessity to purchase power at extremely high prices significantly impacted our costs."

Morgan further explained that if not for the issues related to gas deliverability and the escalated costs associated with it, the impact of winter storm Uri on Vistra's 2021 EBITDA could have been slightly positive. This assertion underscores the significant financial strain that unforeseen operational costs placed on the company.

In response to the financial setbacks caused by storm Uri, Vistra announced it will not proceed with any additional share purchases for the remainder of 2021. However, the company affirmed its commitment to maintain its quarterly dividend, signaling confidence in its financial resilience and ability to navigate through the ongoing challenges.
