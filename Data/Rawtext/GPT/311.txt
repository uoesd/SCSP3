Ever Given Owner Accuses Suez Canal Authority of Negligence in Grounding Incident

The owner of the Ever Given, the colossal container ship that captured global attention when it got stuck in the Suez Canal last March, is laying the blame squarely at the feet of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) for the vessel's grounding. The ship, which was lodged across the canal for six days, created a significant bottleneck in one of the world's most crucial maritime trade routes, affecting global trade and shipping schedules.

Following the incident, the Ever Given has been detained, as the SCA has pursued a staggering $916.5 million compensation claim for the disruption and damages caused. The legal battle over the ship's detention and the hefty compensation sought by the SCA unfolded at the Ismailia economic court, with both parties presenting their arguments.

The ship's Japanese owner, Shoei Kisen, is fervently appealing against the detention and contesting the compensation claim laid out by the SCA. Lawyers representing Shoei Kisen have argued that the SCA was at fault for permitting the ship's voyage through the canal amidst adverse weather conditions and for not providing sufficient tugboat assistance, which could have possibly averted the grounding.

Recordings that have emerged show tense disagreements between the canal's pilots onboard the Ever Given and the SCA's control center regarding the decision to enter the canal under such precarious weather conditions. These recordings serve as a critical piece of evidence for Shoei Kisen's defense.

One of Shoei Kisen's legal representatives, Ahmed Abu Ali, emphasized that the actions of the SCA do not meet the legal criteria for a 'salvage operation,' undermining the authority's claim for compensation. "The Suez Canal Authority's pursuit of such an exorbitant compensation amount lacks a sound legal basis, considering their procedural missteps and the operational decisions made before and during the incident," stated Ahmed Abu Ali.

In addition to contesting the SCA's claim, Shoei Kisen is seeking $100,000 in initial compensation for losses incurred due to the detention of the Ever Given.

The maritime community and international onlookers await the court's decision, anticipated to be delivered on Sunday, with keen interest. This case not only involves significant financial stakes but also raises questions about the responsibilities and decision-making of pivotal entities managing critical global maritime passageways.
