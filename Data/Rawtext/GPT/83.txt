Tennessee Man Pleads Guilty to Capitol Riot Charge

Bryan Wayne Ivey, a Tennessee native, has admitted to his role in the January 6th Capitol riot, pleading guilty to a minor protest-related charge. In a recent court appearance, Ivey acknowledged entering restricted areas during the chaos that unfolded, accepting responsibility for one misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating, or picketing inside Capitol grounds.

As part of his plea agreement, Ivey has agreed to pay $500 in restitution to the United States. The consequences he faces could include prison time, a fine, or probation. This development comes after Ivey was apprehended on March 4 in Tennessee on four charges related to his participation in the riot, with the remainder of the charges dropped pursuant to his plea deal.

Leslie Goemaat, Assistant U.S. Attorney for D.C., highlighted the events leading to Ivey's arrest. A tipster identified him through social media photos amidst the crowd at the Capitol. Court records indicate that although Ivey did not personally break a window, he was an onlooker as another protester committed the act.

The journey to Washington, D.C., was a family affair for Ivey, who traveled with his wife and brother. Neither relative entered the Capitol during the riot. The court has scheduled a sentencing hearing for Sept. 28, with Ivey potentially facing up to six months in prison, a $5,000 fine, and/or one year of probation.

Robert David Baker, a Middle Tennessee public defender, emphasized the mitigation efforts to be presented at the upcoming sentencing. "We plan to present a comprehensive picture of Mr. Ivey and the circumstances surrounding his actions on that day," Baker stated. This case marks the first instance of a defendant with Tennessee ties pleading guilty in connection with the tumultuous events of January 6th.
