Disabled Californians Feel Left Behind by Golden State Stimulus Program

In an oversight that has sparked frustration and disappointment, some disabled Californians have found themselves excluded from the financial relief provided by the Golden State Stimulus. This group, particularly those on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), has expressed feeling neglected during a time when support is desperately needed.

Janet Clendenin, an SSDI recipient, felt a sting of frustration upon learning she was not eligible for the $600 Golden State Stimulus payments. "I didn't work in 2020, not because I chose not to, but because my disability prevents me from holding down a traditional job," Clendenin explained, highlighting a gap in the program's design that overlooked the unique circumstances of individuals like her.

This sentiment is shared among an estimated 1.2 million Californians on SSDI who were skipped over by the stimulus payments. The eligibility criteria for the payments mainly targeted individuals with work income in 2020 or those receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), inadvertently excluding a significant portion of the disabled community.

The oversight has drawn criticism from disability advocates who argue that California has not done enough to support its disabled residents during the pandemic. "It's disheartening to see that when plans are made to help those in need, disabled individuals are often overlooked," stated Andrew Imparato, Executive Director of Disability Rights California.

H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for the Department of Finance, cited logistical challenges as a reason for the exclusion of SSDI recipients. "We faced a distinct challenge in including this group due to a lack of access to federal records that would allow us to identify eligible SSDI recipients quickly and accurately," Palmer explained. However, this rationale provides little solace to those who feel marginalized by the decision.

The exclusion appears even more glaring against the backdrop of financial hardships commonly faced by SSDI recipients. Many live in poverty, grappling with the high costs of medical care and other necessities, making the lack of stimulus support particularly painful.

There is a glimmer of hope, as legislative efforts are underway to include SSDI recipients in future stimulus payments, with negotiations ongoing over the state budget. However, these discussions offer little immediate relief for those currently struggling.

Charis Hill, a disabled activist, managed to qualify for the stimulus payment by filing taxes on freelance work. "I'm one of the lucky few," Hill acknowledged. "But it highlights the unfairness and arbitrary nature of the qualifications, leaving many of my peers without much-needed support."

Governor Gavin Newsom initially announced the Golden State Stimulus in January, with several revisions and expansions occurring in the months that followed. Yet, despite these adjustments, a critical segment of the population remains conspicuously absent from the list of beneficiaries.

Sydney Chandler, who serves as a caretaker for her cousin with severe disabilities, expressed anger and frustration over the exclusion. "It's not just the individuals with disabilities who are affected, but their families and caretakers who bear significant financial burdens as well," Chandler noted, emphasizing the wide-reaching impact of the oversight.

The exclusion of SSDI recipients from the Golden State Stimulus points to a larger issue of accessibility and inclusivity in governmental assistance programs. As California navigates its recovery from the pandemic, advocates argue that a more comprehensive and equitable approach is necessary to ensure that all residents, regardless of disability status, receive the support they need.
