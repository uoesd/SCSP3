Bristol High School Student Arrested for Shooting Threat, Schools to Reopen with Added Security

BRISTOL BOROUGH — A Bristol Borough High School student has been arrested following a threatening message that led to the closure of all district schools on Monday. This precautionary measure was announced after the discovery of a plan to "shoot up" the high school, reported through the Safe2Say tip system. School officials have confirmed that classes will resume on Tuesday with an increased police presence to ensure student safety.

The arrest was made early Monday, as stated by Sgt. Joe Moors, the acting leader of the borough police. This was accomplished with the collaboration of the Bucks County District Attorney's Office and the Bucks County Juvenile Probation Department. "Our department acted quickly upon receiving the tip," Sgt. Moors explained. "Thankfully, we were able to apprehend the student without incident."

The minor in question faces charges in juvenile court for making terroristic threats and disorderly conduct. During the investigation, authorities found no weapons in possession of the student. However, Sgt. Moors highlighted the seriousness of the situation by revealing that there was a "specific plan and specific threat" mentioned.

This incident arrives in the wake of a tragic shooting in Oxford, Michigan, which left four students dead and raised nationwide concerns over school safety.

Acting Superintendent Dr. Thomas Shaffer addressed parents in a letter, informing them of the situation and the steps being taken to ensure their children's safety. "The well-being of our students and staff is our top priority," Dr. Shaffer stated. "I assure you that every measure is being taken to provide a safe learning environment."

As Bristol Borough School District prepares to reopen, the community remains vigilant, with ongoing discussions about measures to enhance school security and foster a safe educational atmosphere.
