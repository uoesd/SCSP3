Canadian Firm Sues Citigroup Over $100 Million Winter Storm Energy Charges

April 21 (Reuters) – Innergex Renewable Energy Inc, a prominent Canadian renewable energy company, has initiated legal action against banking giant Citigroup Inc, seeking redress over charges exceeding $100 million. These charges stem from elevated energy costs implicated by a devastating winter storm in February, which severely impacted Texas's power infrastructure.

Subsidiaries of Innergex, namely Shannon Wind and Flat Top Wind, experienced operational disruptions due to the harsh weather conditions, which led to the halting of their wind turbines. This unforeseen event significantly impacted their ability to deliver on power agreements established with Citi Energy, prompting a financial dispute that has escalated to the courts.

The winter storm in question was nothing short of catastrophic for Texas, causing nearly half of the state's power plants to fail. This infrastructural collapse left approximately 4.5 million residents without access to heat or electricity, setting off a domino effect of financial distress and several bankruptcies across the energy sector.

Upon facing operational difficulties, Shannon Wind and Flat Top Wind declared force majeure, attributing their inability to meet power supply commitments to the freezing of their turbines. However, they allege that Citi Energy disregarded these declarations, opting instead to bill them for the cost of replacement power at rates they describe as noticeably inflated.

Details emerging from the lawsuits reveal that Shannon Wind was billed around $39.5 million, while Flat Top Wind received an even steeper invoice of $79.3 million for electricity. These billed amounts are reported to surpass the projected annual revenues of both entities, highlighting the scale of financial discord between the parties.

The legal action initiated by Innergex seeks to inhibit Citi from progressing with any further actions that could potentially culminate in the foreclosure of the wind projects, alleging that Citi "improperly defaulted" the firms amidst a crisis.

In defense, Citi has posited that disputes of this nature are better suited for resolution under New York law, advocating for the proceedings to be transferred to New York courts. This stance introduces a jurisdictional complexity to the matter, which is currently being deliberated in the Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas.

Notably, the replacement power was billed at $9,000 per megawatt hour, a figure starkly higher than the original contract rates, which hovered around $22 to $26 per megawatt hour. This discrepancy underscores the financial strife faced by the wind firms in the aftermath of the February storm.

Stakeholders such as BlackRock, which holds a partial ownership in one of the wind firms, have remained tight-lipped, declining to comment on the ongoing litigation. Similarly, Starwood Energy Group and Innergex have not yet offered public remarks on the matter.

As the case unfolds in Harris County, it encapsulates broader issues of energy reliability, contractual obligations, and financial resilience within the renewable energy sector, especially in the face of unprecedented weather events.
