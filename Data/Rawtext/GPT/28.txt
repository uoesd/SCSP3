Chicago Man Charged with Threatening to Kill Democrats During Biden Inauguration

In an unsettling aftermath of the recent storming of the U.S. Capitol, a Chicago Heights man has been arrested for threatening to kill Democrats during President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. Louis Capriotti, 45, was taken into custody Tuesday on charges of transmitting a threat in interstate commerce, according to federal prosecutors.

The alarming threats were allegedly made in a voicemail to a U.S. House member from New Jersey on December 29, proclaiming that if certain individuals attempted to remove President Donald Trump from office, "we will surround the motherf---ing White House and we will kill any f---ing Democrat that steps on the motherf---ing lawn."

This was not the first instance of Capriotti delivering frightening messages to members of Congress. He has a history of allegedly leaving disturbing and threatening messages, which has now culminated in legal action against him.

U.S. Attorney John R. Lausch Jr. made it clear that the severity of threats against public servants will not be taken lightly. "Our office takes the security of our public servants very seriously," Lausch stated. "Individuals who cross the line of free speech by making unlawful threats will be held accountable."

If convicted of the charge, Capriotti faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The case against him underscores the heightened tensions and concerns about potential violence leading up to and during the upcoming inauguration.

This arrest follows a distressing episode in American history, where supporters of President Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol, resulting in the tragic loss of five lives, including a Capitol Police officer. The violent breach has ignited fear of further unrest, prompting President Trump to approve an emergency declaration to bolster security measures in Washington D.C.

To further complicate matters, an FBI memo has warned of armed protests anticipated at all 50 state capitols and in D.C. around the time of the inauguration. This has put law enforcement on high alert as they work to ensure the safety of the public and prevent any acts of violence.

The crackdown on individuals making threats of violence illustrates the urgent effort to safeguard the democratic process and protect public servants from harm. As the nation prepares for a new presidency, the focus remains on securing a peaceful transition of power amidst a backdrop of potential threats.
