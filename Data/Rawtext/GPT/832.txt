Tiger Woods' Car Crash Cause Determined but Remains Under Wraps, Officials Seek Privacy Waiver

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has concluded its investigation into the car crash involving celebrated golfer Tiger Woods that occurred in February in California. However, the specific findings regarding the cause of the accident remain undisclosed due to privacy concerns expressed by Woods' team.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said the investigation had "determined what caused the accident," but they are prohibited from releasing this information publicly. This decision comes after Woods' representatives requested privacy regarding the details of the crash. "Some privacy issues on releasing information on the investigation were asked to be kept," Villanueva stated, hinting at the delicacy surrounding the high-profile case.

Efforts are underway to contact Woods and his personnel about the possibility of waiving privacy to enable the release of the investigation's findings. The emphasis is on ensuring that Woods' wishes concerning his private information are respected while also balancing public interest in the incident.

On February 23, Woods was involved in a serious car accident that left his vehicle severely damaged. The crash report details that Woods' car hit a sign, tore through a tree, and ended up in the brush alongside the road with significant damages. Originally, reports surfaced noting that Woods had no recollection of driving or how the incident occurred. This was laid out in a search warrant affidavit aimed at accessing the car's black box.

According to the affidavit, though Woods was unconscious for a time following the accident, he was awake and conscious by the time deputies arrived at the scene. Deputy Johann Schloegl shared, "We have a witness who stated Mr. Woods was unconscious after the accident." This hints at the severity of the crash and the immediate aftermath experienced by the golf star.

Following the accident, Woods underwent emergency surgery to address major injuries sustained to his right lower leg. Mid-March saw Woods returning home to continue his recovery process. A source close to Woods tells PEOPLE, "He's focused on his recovery and feeling grateful to be alive. Tiger appreciates all the great medical care and support he has received from friends, family, and fans."

Woods himself has taken to social media to express his gratitude and share updates on his recovery journey. "Happy to report that I am back home and continuing my recovery," Woods wrote. "I am so grateful for the outpouring of support and encouragement that I have received over the past few weeks."

The golfing legend also shared the joy of being reunited with his children, which has undoubtedly played a significant role in his recovery. "There is no place like home," he noted.

As the investigation wraps up, the public and fans of the golfer await potential future disclosures regarding the cause of the accident. Meanwhile, Woods continues to focus on his health and family, embodying resilience and determination in the face of adversity.
