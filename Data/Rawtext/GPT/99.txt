ECB Joins Global Trend in Tapering Asset Purchases Amidst Economic Recovery

In a significant move that aligns with actions taken by other major global central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has announced its plans to begin the tapering process of its asset purchases. This step marks a crucial shift in the monetary policy approach adopted in response to the economic fallout caused by the global pandemic.

For months, the ECB's rate of asset purchases has outstripped that of the Federal Reserve, averaging an impressive $181 billion per month. This hefty sum underscores the aggressive stance the ECB has taken to mitigate the economic impacts of COVID-19 on the Eurozone. However, as the global economy shows signs of recovery, the ECB, like its counterparts in Japan, Canada, England, New Zealand, and Australia, is starting to scale back its support measures.

Interestingly, the ECB has chosen to frame its decision not as tapering but as a 'recalibration' of its asset purchase programs. "We have judged that a moderately lower pace of net asset purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) would be appropriate, reflecting the progress the economy has made towards recovery," Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, explained. This careful language mirrors the cautious approach other central banks have taken, aiming to avoid any abrupt market reactions.

The recalibration involves adjusting the pace of the PEPP, which is set to continue at a somewhat reduced rate until at least March 2022. The ECB plans to maintain the total balance of purchased assets at least until the end of 2023, ensuring a gradual transition away from emergency measures. Other programs, including the Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO III) and the Asset Purchase Program (APP), will proceed without change, signaling a nuanced approach to tapering.

The ECB's total asset balance, predominantly comprising bonds and loans to banks, has soared to approximately €8.2 trillion. This significant accumulation of assets highlights the extraordinary measures taken to support the Eurozone economy during unprecedented times.

Central banks globally concur that winding down QE programs is a necessary precursor to raising interest rates. This step is critical to avoid distortions in the yield curve that could jeopardize financial stability. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve continues to expand its balance sheet by $120 billion a month, though there is a growing consensus on the need to start tapering within the year.

In her remarks, Lagarde emphasized the unanimous support for the decision to recalibrate asset purchases. "This decision was taken with an eye towards the future, ensuring that we can navigate the path to recovery without destabilizing the Eurozone," she stated. This stance reflects a careful balance between supporting the economy and preparing for the inevitable task of unwinding the extraordinary financial measures taken during the pandemic.
