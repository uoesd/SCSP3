Buccaneers' O.J. Howard Finds Joy in Fatherhood Amid Injury Recovery

TAMPA – For Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end O.J. Howard, the 2020 NFL season could have been the pinnacle of his professional career. Poised for a breakthrough year, Howard's ambitions were suddenly halted by an Achilles rupture, sidelining him for most of the team's Super Bowl-winning season. However, the birth of his daughter, Caliana Mia Howard, has provided him with comfort and a new perspective during his recovery.

"It was devastating to miss out on what my team accomplished, but becoming a father has been the most incredible experience," Howard shared, reflecting on the unexpected silver lining during one of the toughest times in his career. "It's given me something positive to focus on every day."

Before the injury, Howard was evidently on track for his best season. He had become a key target for legendary quarterback Tom Brady, who joined the Buccaneers that season. Howard's performance was notably impressive until that unfortunate game against the Los Angeles Chargers. "I just went to plant and push off, and it felt like someone kicked me in the back of my leg," Howard recounted. "I knew immediately something was seriously wrong."

The injury was a heart-wrenching setback for Howard, who had diligently prepared for the season. Understanding the level of excellence required with Brady's arrival, he had invested considerable time into enhancing his fitness and focus on the game. "There was a definite sense that we were building towards something special, and I wanted to contribute to that," said Howard.

Despite the rigors of his NFL career, Howard has always prioritized family, a value deeply rooted in his upbringing in Prattville, Ala. Coming from a family that often gathered around children, Howard was thrilled at the prospect of becoming a father himself. "I've always been surrounded by love and family, so the arrival of Caliana was something I looked forward to immensely," Howard expressed.

The timing of his daughter's birth, amidst the throes of injury recovery, afforded Howard a rare opportunity. "Most athletes don't get to spend this much time at home during the season," said Chanel Sideboard, Howard's girlfriend and the mother of Caliana. "We've really cherished these moments together."

Finding joy in fatherhood while away from the football field, Howard has embraced the role of a full-time parent during his rehab process. In addition to the support from Sideboard, Howard spent considerable time with teammate Vita Vea, who was also on the injured reserve list. "Vita and I leaned on each other a lot. Just being able to share that recovery process with someone who understands has been invaluable," Howard acknowledged.

As Howard's rehab nears its completion, his anticipation to return to football is met with equal enthusiasm for the continued joys of fatherhood. "I can't wait to get back on the field with my teammates and continue where I left off," Howard stated confidently. "But this time away has shown me how important it is to find a balance. My family, especially Caliana, is a huge part of that."

The narrative of Howard's career thus far is undeniably marked by its highs and lows, characterized by promising performances disrupted by injuries. Nevertheless, his journey over the past year highlights an athlete's resilience and the profound impact of fatherhood.

Sideboard mirrored Howard's sentiments, emphasizing the personal growth both have experienced through this chapter. "Seeing O.J. embrace being a dad and tackle his rehab with such determination has been so inspiring," she remarked. "Caliana has brought an incredible amount of joy to our lives."

The community and family environment from which Howard hails has rallied around him, offering support and celebrating the Buccaneers' success in his absence. For Howard, this sense of community and family ties has played a significant role in his recovery. "Knowing I have the support of so many people means the world to me. It's motivated me to come back stronger," he said.

While the memory of not being able to physically contribute to the Buccaneers' Super Bowl victory still stings, Howard is focused on the future. His ambitions for the upcoming season are clear, aiming not only to make an impact on the field but also to build lasting memories with his daughter.

"The experiences I've had over the past few months have changed me for the better," Howard reflected. "I'm excited to return as not just a better player, but a better person and father."

As Howard continues his journey in the NFL, the balance between professional athlete and devoted father will undoubtedly define his path. With his reemergence on the field on the horizon, Howard is not just looking forward to scoring touchdowns and winning games. He's equally excited about bedtime stories and watching Caliana take her first steps.

"I want Caliana to grow up knowing her dad is there for her, no matter what," Howard concluded. "Whether it's on the field or at home, I want to be her biggest supporter."

Through the adversity of injury and the transformative experience of becoming a father, O.J. Howard embodies the resilience and multifaceted identity of modern athletes. As he readies himself to don the Buccaneers' jersey once again, Howard's heart remains firmly rooted in the love for his family and the unwavering support for his team.
