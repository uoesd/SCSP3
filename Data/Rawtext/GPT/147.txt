Sean Hannity Dominates Cable News Ratings, Topping Tucker Carlson

In a significant show of dominance, Sean Hannity's evening program on Fox News Channel emerged as the most-watched cable news show last week, drawing in a massive audience of 3.7 million viewers. This put Hannity's show slightly ahead of "Tucker Carlson Tonight," which is also known for its high viewership on the network. The competition between the two heavyweight shows underscores Fox News' continued prowess in attracting large audiences in the ever-competitive cable news landscape.

Not only did Hannity lead in overall viewership, but he also took the lead in the coveted 25-54 age demographic, securing 669,000 viewers within this group. Tucker Carlson closely followed with 654,000 viewers in the same demographic, highlighting the close race for viewers' attention between the two hosts. The demographic is especially important for advertisers, making Hannity's lead a significant victory for his program.

During the week of August 16 through 22, Fox News Channel outperformed its competition, averaging a total audience of 2.980 million viewers in prime time, the highest among all cable news networks. The network's performance surpassed that of CNN and MSNBC, and even outdid broadcast networks during prime time hours, marking a noteworthy achievement in Fox News' ratings history.

Fox News' lineup continued to show its strength with other programs like "The Five," "The Ingraham Angle," and "Special Report with Bret Baier" also drawing significant viewership numbers. Meanwhile, the return of Chris Cuomo to CNN with "Cuomo Prime Time" saw a total audience of 1.076 million viewers, reflecting a 28% decline, and a more than 30% reduction in the key 25-54 demographic. Notably, CNN also experienced a substantial drop of 30% in women viewers for "Cuomo Prime Time," pointing to shifting viewer preferences and challenges faced by the network.

As cable news battles for viewership, Fox News Channel continues to lead, drawing large audiences with its prime-time lineup. The network's ability to outperform its competitors, including in the significant 25-54 demographic, underscores the loyalty of its viewer base and its superiority in the cable news sector.
