Biden's Historic Arrival in D.C. Marks Solemn Eve of Inauguration

WASHINGTON (AP) – On the eve of his inauguration as the 46th president of the United States, Joe Biden arrived in Washington D.C. from Delaware, transitioning to his new role amidst unprecedented challenges and national tension. Biden's journey to the capital was marked by a poignant farewell to his home state and sobering realities of security threats, as he flew into Joint Base Andrews on a privately chartered plane—a departure from the tradition that saw President Donald Trump arriving on a government aircraft in 2017.

Security concerns, heightened by the recent Capitol riot and ongoing threats, necessitated Biden's choice to fly rather than travel by Amtrak train, a mode of transport that the president-elect had favored throughout his political career for trips between Delaware and D.C. The alteration in travel plans underscores the tense atmosphere surrounding this inauguration.

Upon arrival, President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are slated to attend a COVID-19 memorial, acknowledging the devastating toll of the pandemic on the nation. Biden will then spend the night at Blair House, the president's official guesthouse, further underscoring the traditional rites of passage to the highest office in the land, even as they are adapted for these extraordinary times.

In a farewell address to his home state, Biden expressed his deep emotional ties to Delaware, affirming, "I will always be a proud son of the state of Delaware." His words resonated with the sense of personal and national journey as the country stands on the threshold of a new administration.

Meanwhile, security preparations for the inauguration have led to the vetting of all military personnel involved in the event. Gen. Daniel Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard, addressed concerns, saying, "Due to operational security, I'm not going to talk specifically about numbers. But I will say that we've had 12 identified that have been removed from the mission." He added that the vetting process was standard but emphasized due to the context of the inauguration.

While no specific plot against Biden was cited as the reason for the removal of two National Guard members, the discovery of extremist views or ties to right-wing militias among a dozen Army National Guard members has underscored the heightened state of alert.

In his farewell address, President Donald Trump stated, "I prayed for the success of the next administration." However, his sentiment stands in contrast to the tension and division his presidency has engendered, climaxing in the attack on the Capitol that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has attributed to Trump's provocation.

As Biden prepares to take office, the political landscape sees a shift with the swearing-in of three new Democratic senators, effectively granting Democrats control of the Senate. This transition promises significant implications for Biden's ability to enact his agenda and navigate the challenges ahead.

The nation now watches as Joe Biden steps into his role as president, against the backdrop of a deeply divided America and an ongoing global pandemic. His arrival in D.C. not only marks a personal milestone but also a significant moment in American history, as the country grapples with its ideals, its fears, and its future.
