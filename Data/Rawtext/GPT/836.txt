Tiger Woods' Car Crash: Speeding and Disorientation Detailed in Report

In a revealing account of the events surrounding Tiger Woods' single-vehicle crash in February, details have surfaced that paint a picture of disorientation and high speed leading up to the accident in Los Angeles. Despite Woods' mistaken belief that he was in Florida during a hospital interview, investigators pieced together the moments leading to the crash.

Following the accident, medical personnel found that Woods' blood pressure was too low to administer pain medication. At the scene, an empty pharmaceutical bottle was discovered, raising initial concerns. However, further investigation clarified the sequence of events.

Vehicle data revealed that Woods was traveling straight, with no steering input detected until late in the crash sequence. This detail suggested a loss of control that Sergeant Michael Downing, who authored the data report, said was due to Woods driving at a speed unsafe for the road conditions and his inability to negotiate a curve.

"Woods was traveling over 82 mph in a 45-mph zone and applied the gas pedal at 99% just before the crash," stated Jonathan Cherney, a forensic crash reconstruction expert. The absence of braking or steering effort led to speculation that Woods might have been unconscious or incapacitated in the moments before the accident.

Despite the circumstances, Officer Justin Smith and investigators found no reason to believe Woods was impaired by alcohol or drugs at the time. Sheriff Alex Villanueva of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department confirmed this, dispelling rumors of impaired driving.

Deputy Kyle Sullivan, who interviewed Woods post-crash, noted that the golf legend was "somewhat combative," a behavior attributed to the trauma and shock from his injuries, rather than any substance influence.

This incident marks Woods' third notable encounter with driving mishaps since 2009, including a previous careless driving citation and a DUI arrest, adding a tumultuous chapter to the sports icon's career and personal life.
