Prince Harry Returns to UK for Prince Philip's Funeral Amidst Royal Baby Name Speculation

This weekend, Prince Harry made a solemn journey back to London to attend the funeral of his grandfather, Prince Philip, marking his first visit since relocating to California. The Duke of Sussex, who now resides in the US with his wife Meghan Markle and their son Archie, made the trip alone, leaving behind Meghan, who is heavily pregnant with their second child.

Meghan Markle, advised not to travel due to her advanced pregnancy, remained in the US. The couple, who stepped back from their royal duties last year, are expecting a baby girl due in the summer months of June or July, a delightful announcement they shared with the world on Valentine's Day.

Amidst the solemn occasion, speculation continues to swirl around the name the Duke and Duchess of Sussex might choose for their daughter. A significant detail is capturing the imagination of royal fans and bettors alike: the couple may choose to honor Queen Elizabeth and the late Prince Philip in naming their baby girl. The name 'Lily' is gaining traction as a strong contender, seen as a potential nod to the Queen's childhood nickname, 'Lilibet,' affectionately used by her parents and her beloved husband, Prince Philip.

Social media platforms and betting sites are abuzz with anticipation, considering how the couple may wish to pay tribute. Given Prince Harry's evident affection for his grandparents, it is widely speculated that their daughter's name could serve as a heartfelt homage.

Royal enthusiasts and pundits alike scrutinize the Sussexes' choice, as the selection of a name is seen as laden with significance. Betting odds from the likes of Paddy Power are offering up various possibilities, with names like Diana, after Harry's late mother, Princess Diana, Allegra, and Maya also in the running. However, 'Lily' remains a poignant possibility, intertwining the family's past and future.

This speculation is not without precedent; royal names often carry deep familial and historical significance. The name 'Lilibet', while unique, was a personal touch, signifying the close bond between the Queen and Prince Philip. By choosing a variant of this name, Harry and Meghan could be signaling a desire to maintain a connection to Harry's heritage and to honor the matriarch of the family.

Public speculation on the matter is rife, with the couple's choice seen as not merely a personal decision but a statement of their current standing within, or alongside, the royal family. Names can embody reconciliation, respect, and remembrance, elements that are closely watched by observers of the Royal Family.

As the world anticipates the arrival of Meghan and Harry's baby girl, the choice of name remains a closely guarded secret. Yet, whether they opt for 'Lily' or another name entirely, the decision will undoubtedly be made with deep personal significance and a nod to their family's roots and legacy. In a time of reflection following Prince Philip's funeral, the future arrival of their daughter stands as a beacon of new beginnings and hope for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.
