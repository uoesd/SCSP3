Prince Harry and Meghan to Advocate for Vaccine Equity at Global Citizen Live in NYC

In a pivotal move for global health, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan, are set to champion vaccine equity at the forthcoming Global Citizen Live event. Scheduled for September 25 in New York City's Central Park, the event is a crucial part of a 24-hour global broadcast aimed at fostering global vaccine equity to halt the spread of COVID-19.

Global Citizen Live seeks to mobilize support against the glaring injustice in vaccine access across the world. The campaign's primary call to action targets G7 countries and the European Union, urging them to share at least 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses immediately. Additionally, it pushes for the waiver of vaccine intellectual property rights to facilitate broader, more equitable access to life-saving vaccines.

Adding a technical plea, the campaign beseeches leading vaccine manufacturers Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna to share their mRNA vaccine technology with the World Health Organization-backed technology hub in South Africa. This would greatly enable the production of vaccines in regions that are currently facing acute shortages.

The Duke and Duchess are no strangers to advocating for vaccine equity. Their previous involvement as co-chairs of the VAX LIVE event and authors of an open letter to pharmaceutical giants underscore their commitment to this cause. Through their efforts, along with the formidable platform of Global Citizen, they successfully spearheaded a fundraising initiative that gathered $3.5 million for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. This substantial fund is earmarked for COVAX to facilitate the distribution of vaccines to the world's poorest countries, illustrating a significant stride towards equitable vaccine access.

Prince Harry's vocal stance that vaccine access should be a universal right reflects the underlying ethos of the Global Citizen Live campaign. "Access to the vaccine is not just a privilege but a right for all," he has pointed out, spotlighting the dire need for equitable health resources, especially as the coronavirus mutates and evolves, posing new threats worldwide.

The crux of the issue lies in the ongoing disparities in vaccine distribution and access. Wealthy nations have been criticized for hoarding vaccines, thereby exacerbating an already tense global health emergency. The spread of more infectious coronavirus variants only amplifies the urgency for a concerted, equitable approach to vaccine distribution.

Global Citizen Live aims to extend its advocacy beyond vaccine equity, with a roster of appearances by health and global leaders, activists, and artists. The event will champion not only global health but also environmental protection and the fight against poverty. With the world at a crucial juncture, the contributions of such influential figures are anticipated to make a significant impact.

The backdrop of this global campaign is the pressing need for substantial commitments from wealthy nations concerning climate change. The event calls for aggressive emissions reductions by businesses and seeks a $6 billion contribution to address global hunger, highlighting the interconnectedness of health, environment, and economic stability.

In essence, Global Citizen Live encapsulates a holistic approach to global challenges, leveraging the star power of figures like The Duke and Duchess of Sussex to catalyze change. As the world tunes in on September 25, the hope is that this collective call to action will resonate across continents, prompt policy shifts, and usher in a new era of global solidarity and equity.
