AFI Launches Scholarship in Honor of Halyna Hutchins, Championing Women in Cinematography

In a heartfelt tribute to the late Halyna Hutchins, a groundbreaking cinematographer whose life was tragically cut short on the set of "Rust," the American Film Institute (AFI) has inaugurated a scholarship fund dedicated exclusively to supporting aspiring women cinematographers. This initiative not only commemorates Hutchins' remarkable legacy but also aims to pave the way for upcoming female talents behind the camera.

Hutchins' fatal accident occurred during a tragic mishap involving a prop gun, which unexpectedly discharged a live round, claiming her life on the set. Despite the tragedy, her spirit and influence persist, particularly in those who were closest to her. Olia Oparina, a close friend and collaborator of Hutchins, reminisced about their shared journey from their initial steps in Hollywood to making significant strides in an industry that's tough to navigate. "Halyna was more than a friend; she was a beacon for many of us, sharing a passion that transcended her craft. She advocated for women's voices in our field, always pushing the boundaries of storytelling through her lens," Oparina expressed.

Their story is one of determination and mutual support. Hutchins and Oparina, both immigrants, forged their path in the competitive landscape of Hollywood, creating a 'tribe' of like-minded individuals committed to lifting each other up. Her dedication to her craft and to fostering a more inclusive industry was evident in everything she did. "She was not just brilliant behind the camera; she was a force for change, challenging us to look beyond the frame and see the potential in ourselves and each other," said Oparina.

Before the incident that took her life, Hutchins was making a name for herself with an impressive array of projects like 'Archenemy' and 'Blindfire.' Her untimely death at 42 left a void in the hearts of her family, friends, and admirers within the broader film community.

The AFI scholarship in her memory is now open for donations, aimed at empowering female cinematographers to build sustainable careers in an industry where Hutchins herself was a shining example. Born in Ukraine, Hutchins was an alumna of UCLA's Professional Producing program and the AFI Conservatory, marking significant milestones that underscore her dedication and passion for cinema. Through this scholarship, Hutchins' legacy will continue to inspire and support the next generation of women in film.
