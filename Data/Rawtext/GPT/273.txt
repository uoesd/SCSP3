WHO Grants Emergency Authorisation to Two AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 Vaccines

The World Health Organization (WHO) has marked a significant milestone in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by listing two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine for emergency use. Produced by AstraZeneca-SKBio (Republic of Korea) and the Serum Institute of India, these vaccines are now set to play a pivotal role in the global effort to halt the coronavirus's spread.

The Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by WHO is a critical step in ensuring the vaccines' global supply, particularly via the COVAX Facility — a global initiative aimed at equitable vaccine distribution. It also empowers countries worldwide to expedite their regulatory approval processes for the vaccine's deployment.

Dr. Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products, highlighted the significance of this achievement, stating, "Countries with no access to vaccines to date will finally be able to start vaccinating their health workers and populations at risk, contributing to the COVAX Facility's goal of equitable vaccine distribution."

The EUL process entails rigorous evaluation by WHO, requiring vaccine developers to submit comprehensive data to facilitate a swift and thorough assessment. Remarkably, the assessment for the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines — including the review of late-stage trial data and manufacturing quality — was completed in under four weeks, showcasing the efficiency and dedication of all involved.

In addition, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has recommended the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine for individuals aged 18 and above, broadening the scope of its potential impact. The vaccine, known as ChAdOx1-S, demonstrated a 63.09% efficacy in global trials, making it a strong candidate for deployment in low- and middle-income countries due to its affordable cost and storage requirements.

This move underscores WHO's commitment to making health products available swiftly in emergency situations without compromising safety, efficacy, and quality standards. Dr. Simão's emphasis on equitable distribution reflects a collective aspiration for widespread, inclusive access to lifesaving interventions.

Earlier, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine received WHO's emergency use listing on 31 December 2020, marking the beginning of the global vaccine rollout under the COVAX initiative. As more vaccines gain emergency approval, the horizon for overcoming the pandemic broadens, heralding hope for a return to normalcy across the globe.
