East Bay Man Mourns Family Victims in Kabul Airport Blast Amid Community Heartache

SAN LEANDRO, Calif. (KGO) – In a tragic blend of personal loss and geopolitical turmoil, an East Bay man, Qiamuddin Safi, is reeling from the catastrophic effects of the Kabul airport attack on his family. Safi, who recently escaped Afghanistan, has relayed the harrowing news that his cousin, a dedicated interpreter for the U.S. Army, lost his life in one of the deadly explosions at Abbey Gate. The horror did not end there for Safi's family; his brother and another cousin currently fight for their lives in the ICU, while two more cousins are recovering in the hospital.

Safi's narrative sheds light on the perilous conditions his family navigated despite holding Special Immigration Visas (SIV), designed to offer a safe passage for Afghans who worked for the U.S. government. "It wasn't supposed to be like this. They served the U.S. Army, believing in a promise of safety," a devastated Safi shared.

The Kabul airport attack has resonated deeply within the Afghan community in the United States, adding layers of heartache and fear. Many, like Safi's family, sought refuge and a new start in America, only to confront violence and uncertainty.

Community leaders and organizations have taken up the mantle to support Afghan refugees caught in the crisis. They emphasize the urgency of addressing the ongoing human rights violations in Afghanistan and the need for a more robust support system for those fleeing the regime.

Harris Mojadedi, with the Afghan Coalition, noted, "The situation in Afghanistan is not just a political crisis; it's a humanitarian disaster. We must do everything we can to support our brothers and sisters in need."

Safi's story is a stark reminder of the Taliban's threat to Afghans associated with the U.S. government, marking them as targets for retribution. Despite Safi's proactive efforts to secure his family's safety by reaching out to Bay Area lawmakers for help with the SIV application, his pleas went unanswered.

"This tragedy has underscored the confusion and grief peeling through our community," commented Sara Fain, an attorney with the Immigration Institute of the Bay Area. "Navigating the SIV process is complex under the best circumstances, let alone during a crisis."

Indeed, the grim reality for many trying to assist their family members escape Afghanistan is a labyrinth of bureaucratic and logistical challenges, exacerbated by the current conditions.

Adding to Safi's torment is the loss of his cousin, who left behind two young children and was expecting a third. "He was more than a cousin to me; he was a brother. He had dreams for his children's future, dreams that are now lost," Safi lamented.

The distressing events at Kabul airport have galvanized the Afghan diaspora and their allies, highlighting the dire need for immediate and concerted action to aid those at risk. According to Fain, "Time is of the essence. Every moment we delay, lives are put at risk. It's imperative we streamline SIV processing and evacuation efforts."

Echoing this sentiment, Mojadedi pointed out, "Our community is tight-knit. When one suffers, we all feel the pain. It's crucial now more than ever to stand in solidarity and push for change."

As Safi grapples with his profound loss, he is also bracing for the challenging road ahead for his injured family members. "The path to recovery will be long and wrought with obstacles. But it's a testament to their resilience," he stated.

Safi's story, while uniquely heartbreaking, is not isolated. Many Afghan families in the Bay Area and across the United States continue to face similar uncertainties and fears for their loved ones' safety.

The Afghan Coalition, along with immigration advocacy groups, are urging the community to rally support for Afghan refugees. "We need to amplify our voices, reach out to our representatives, and demand faster, more humane processing of SIV applications," Mojadedi urged.

While the situation in Afghanistan remains precarious, the resilience of its people, both at home and abroad, shines through the despair. Safi, through his pain, holds on to hope, "For my family, and for all Afghans, we can't give up. Our spirit is strong, and our will to create a better future is unbreakable."

As the Bay Area and the wider world observe the developments, the story of Safi and his family underscores the urgent need for compassion, action, and a commitment to safeguard the rights and lives of Afghan refugees and their families.
