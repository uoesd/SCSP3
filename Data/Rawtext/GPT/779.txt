Safety Negligence Alleged on Film Sets Including 'Rust' Involving Head Armorer

In a shocking revelation surrounding the tragic shooting on the set of 'Rust' that resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, new allegations have emerged about the head armorer's previous conduct. Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the professional responsible for managing firearms on set, is now under scrutiny for her alleged 'carelessness' with guns, including an incident where she reportedly handed an improperly checked gun to 11-year-old actress Ryan Kiera Armstrong on a different film set.

This comes amidst an investigation by the New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Bureau into the circumstances leading up to the fatal shooting on the 'Rust' set. The bureau aims to determine whether health and safety violations contributed to the accident, which could lead to severe civil penalties.

Sources from the production have come forward, claiming that Gutierrez-Reed had once provided a loaded weapon to a child actress without verifying if the barrel was clear of obstructions. The alarming oversight called for immediate action from concerned crew members, leading to the halt of filming until the firearm was adequately inspected.

Adding to the concerns, Gutierrez-Reed had openly discussed her apprehensions about her experience level for such a critical role. Remarkably, 'Rust' marked only her second project as the principal gun handler, raising significant questions about the adequacy of her experience for managing weapons on a movie set.

Prior incidents of negligent handling of prop firearms had already put the 'Rust' production team on edge. Before the tragedy that led to Hutchins's death and injured director Joel Souza, crew members had vocalized their worries following several unintentional discharges of prop guns.

The incident has cast a stark spotlight on the film industry's practices regarding on-set safety, particularly concerning the use of real firearms. Gutierrez-Reed's role as head armorer has become a focal point in the ongoing discussions about the necessity of stringent safety protocols and adequate training for all individuals responsible for handling dangerous equipment on film sets.

The loss of Halyna Hutchins has reverberated through the film community, prompting calls for immediate and comprehensive reform to prevent similar tragedies. As the New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Bureau continues its investigation, the entertainment industry awaits recommendations that could lead to significant changes in how on-set safety is approached, especially in productions involving firearms.

The outcome of this investigation could potentially reshape safety standards and enforce stricter regulatory compliance across the board, ensuring that the tragic events that unfolded on the 'Rust' set do not occur again. As the film community mourns, the urgency for actionable change has become clear, underscoring the paramount importance of prioritizing the well-being of all individuals involved in the creative process.
