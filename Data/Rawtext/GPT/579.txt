Baby Lifted Over Kabul Airport Wall Now Safe in Phoenix

In a heartwarming turn of events, Liya, the Afghan baby who captured the world's attention when she was passed over a wall to U.S. troops during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, is now safely settled with her family in Phoenix. Born amidst turmoil, Liya was just 16 days old when her father, Hameed, a linguist and cultural adviser, made the desperate decision to lift her into the hands of waiting Marines outside Kabul airport in August.

The baby girl became an emblem of hope and despair woven into the narrative of the U.S. exit from Afghanistan. Hameed, her father, had turned to the U.S. Marines for help after observing that his family needed assistance to navigate the perilous surroundings. Clutching his daughter for a brief moment, Hameed then handed her over to another Marine to ensure his wife could receive help after being robbed by the Taliban.

Liya's journey from her father's arms over the barbed wire to safety captured the hearts of millions worldwide as the image spread like wildfire across social media platforms during the Taliban's swift takeover. "It was a moment of pure hope amid chaos," a Phoenix resident, who followed the story, shares.

In a conversation with PEOPLE, John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesperson, confirmed in August, "The child was reunited with her father and was being treated for an illness at a Norwegian field hospital at the airport." Kirby's words helped quell the growing concern for Liya's well-being amidst the uncertainty following the evacuation efforts.

Describing his daughter, Hameed calls Liya "a fighter," revealing he is contemplating adding 'Marine' as her middle name in honor of the bravery and compassion shown by the troops who ensured her safety. This symbolic gesture underscores the indelible bond formed in those fleeting, yet pivotal, moments.

Complicating the narrative, Lance Cpl. Hunter Clark recently claimed at a Trump rally that he was the Marine who lifted Liya over the wall, a statement which has sparked controversy and scrutiny. The Marine Corps has refuted his claim, asserting that Clark was not the one responsible for this act. The Corps' denial adds a layer of complexity to the already emotional tale, raising questions about memory, heroism, and the fog of crisis.

Currently, Clark finds himself under investigation for potentially violating Pentagon policies aimed at keeping military personnel from engaging in partisan political activities. His mother, speaking on his behalf due to the ongoing probe, indicated that her son could not engage with the media at this time.

The investigation underscores the delicate balance military members must maintain between their personal convictions and their professional obligations, a balance that has been thrust into the limelight by Clark's public appearance at a political event.

As for Liya and her family, their journey from the brink of despair at Kabul airport to the safety of their new home in Phoenix is a testament to human resilience and the unpredictable paths life can take. The community has rallied around them, offering support and celebrating the safety of the young child who, for a moment, became the face of the Afghan crisis.

Liya's story, marked by fear, bravery, and eventual relief, continues to resonate with those who followed her journey and with many more who find in her narrative a symbol of hope amid adversity. As her father contemplates the addition of 'Marine' to her name, it serves as a reminder of the profound impact a single act of kindness can have, crossing boundaries, and touching lives in ways unimaginable.
