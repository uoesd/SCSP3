Kyle Rittenhouse Announces Plans to Attend Arizona State University In-Person Amid Confusion Over Enrollment Status

In a recent turn of events, Kyle Rittenhouse revealed in a podcast appearance his intention to attend Arizona State University (ASU) in-person for the spring semester. This announcement has stirred both interest and confusion regarding his current enrollment status at the institution. Promptly responding to the buzz, an Arizona State University spokesperson stated that Rittenhouse has not yet applied but is encouraged to go through the application process like any other prospective student.

Previously, Rittenhouse took a 'compassionate withdrawal' from two online nursing classes at ASU, a decision that led to contentious reactions on campus. Protests emerged both in opposition to and in support of his potential physical attendance at the university, illuminating the divide in public opinion following his acquittal.

Last month, Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all counts related to the shooting of two individuals during a 2020 protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Despite the controversy, Rittenhouse claims he is still an admitted student at ASU and holds a student portfolio, albeit not enrolled in any current classes. His expressed intent is to pursue an undergraduate degree with aspirations to eventually attend law school.

Addressing the situation, Jay Thorne, an Arizona State spokesperson, told Forbes, "Arizona State University has not received an application from Mr. Rittenhouse. Like any prospective student, Mr. Rittenhouse would need to undergo the standard admissions process."

As the conversation around Rittenhouse's academic and legal journey continues, his representative has not immediately responded to Forbes' request for comment. The heart of the controversy remains focused on whether Rittenhouse will indeed become a part of the ASU community and how his past and aspirations will influence his academic path.
