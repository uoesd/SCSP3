Body Found in Wyoming Believed to Be Missing Traveler Gabby Petito

MOOSE, Wyo. (AP) – A tragic turn in the search for 22-year-old Gabrielle "Gabby" Petito came on Sunday when a body, believed to be hers, was discovered in Wyoming. Petito had captivated national attention after she vanished during a cross-country trip with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie. The discovery in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, as announced by the FBI, marks a significant, yet somber development in the case.

FBI Supervisory Special Agent Charles Jones confirmed the find to reporters, stating, "Human remains were discovered consistent with the description of Gabrielle 'Gabby' Petito. Full forensic identification has not been completed to confirm 100% that we found Gabby, but her family has been notified of this discovery." The grim news followed an intensive two-day search of campgrounds in the area.

While the discovery is a critical piece in the puzzle of Petito's disappearance, the cause of death remains undetermined. "The cause of death has not been determined at this time," Jones added, emphasizing the ongoing nature of the investigation.

In response to the day's developments, Richard Benson Stafford, an attorney for Petito's family, requested that the family be given space to grieve. "The family expresses its gratitude for the love and concern shown for Gabby," Stafford relayed in a statement. "We will be making a statement when Gabby is home. I will personally contact you to arrange a time to discuss what comes next."

The discovery has prompted authorities to close off parts of Grand Teton National Park and surrounding areas, underscoring the seriousness of the ongoing investigation. Officials hope the closures will assist in piecing together the events leading up to Petito's disappearance.

Petito and Laundrie had set out in July on a cross-country trek in a converted van to visit national parks across the U.S. However, Laundrie returned to his parents' home in North Port, Florida, on September 1 without Petito, sparking widespread concern and leading to the initiation of a missing persons report on September 11 by Petito's parents.

In parallel, the search for Laundrie, who has been named a person of interest in the case, intensifies. Over 50 law enforcement officers from multiple agencies have been combing the Carlton Reserve in Sarasota County, Florida, following reports of him heading there.

Authorities have called for anyone with information about Petito's or Laundrie's movements near the Grand Teton camp sites to come forward. This beckoning for public assistance underscored the complexities facing investigators as they work to unravel what happened to Petito and Laundrie's role in the matter.

As the investigation unfolds, the converging lines of inquiry in Wyoming and Florida underscore a deeply troubling case that has captured the nation's attention. The communities around Grand Teton and North Port await further developments, hoping for answers in the heartbreaking disappearance of Gabby Petito.
