Suez Canal Backlog Nears End, But Shipping Disruptions Likely to Persist for Months, Warns Maersk

After a nerve-wracking week that saw over 400 ships stranded due to the Ever Given blocking the Suez Canal, a notable development is on the horizon. Authorities report that 61 remaining ships are expected to clear the Canal today, marking the end of the immediate backlog caused by this unprecedented event.

The world's biggest shipping company, Maersk, however, has sounded a note of caution. The logistics giant has warned of months needed to resolve the cascading disruptions across global supply chains, suggesting the ripple effects of the blockage are far-reaching and complex to untangle swiftly.

Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, Osama Rabie, announced optimism, stating that 85 ships will pass through the waterway on Saturday. "The Canal's swift return to full operation has beat initial estimates by a couple of days, reflecting the dedication and hard work of our team to rectify this unforeseen blockage," Rabie said.

However, clearing the backlog doesn't imply an immediate return to regular shipping operations. The reopening of the canal marks the beginning of a long road towards normalization, with the maritime and logistics sectors bracing for prolonged disruptions.

Maersk has stressed the point, predicting that the consequences of the blockage could take several months to fully unravel. The Ever Given, a colossal container ship, was lodged in a critical segment of the Suez Canal for almost 152 hours, effectively halting traffic in a waterway that handles about 12% of global trade.

According to estimates, the blockage has caused a staggering $60 billion in total costs, encompassing delayed goods, skyrocketing shipping rates, and the crucial time lost for shipping lines worldwide.

Further complicating matters, an ongoing investigation into the exact causes of the blockage is expected to shed light on what went wrong. "The investigation is going well and will take two more days. Then we will announce the results," stated Rabie, hinting at imminent answers to the myriad questions raised by this incident.

As the global shipping industry watches closely, the conclusion of the Suez Canal's traffic jam does not signify an end to the challenges ahead. The weeks and months to come will be crucial in determining the full impact of this event and in implementing measures to mitigate such disturbances in the future.
