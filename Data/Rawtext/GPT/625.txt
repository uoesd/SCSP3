Vice President Harris to Forge Stronger Ties in Asia with Landmark Trip to Singapore and Vietnam

In a strategic move that underscores the Biden-Harris administration's pledge that "America is back," Vice President Kamala Harris is slated for a landmark journey to Singapore and Vietnam from August 20 to August 26. This trip aims to reinforce the United States' commitment to Asia, highlighting the necessity of comprehensive engagement and deepening strategic partnerships across the continent.

According to the administration, the Vice President's visit is set to address critical issues including trade, security, particularly concerns in the South China Sea, and fostering economic cooperation. Harris's itinerary includes high-level meetings with government officials, influential leaders from the private sector, and prominent figures in civil society, reflecting a broad approach to reinforcing diplomatic and economic bonds.

"Vice President Harris's trip will be focused on strengthening the United States' leadership in the world and expanding our economic partnerships and engagement in the Indo-Pacific region," explained Symone Sanders, Chief Spokesperson for the Vice President. This visit marks a historic first, as Harris will be the first Vice President ever to step foot in Vietnam, symbolizing the Administration's dedication to building bridges and opening new avenues for dialogue in Asia.

The discussions throughout the visit will not shy away from tackling global challenges. Regional security, the ongoing battle against the Covid-19 pandemic, and the pressing issue of climate change stand at the forefront of the agenda. These topics reflect the Biden-Harris administration's holistic approach to foreign policy, one that recognizes the interconnected nature of security, economic health, and environmental sustainability.

This trip represents Harris's inaugural visit to the region as vice president and her second international trip since stepping into office, following closely on the heels of her journey to Guatemala and Mexico aimed at addressing the root causes of migration to the U.S. southern border.

The Vice President's impending visit to Asia is a critical component of the Biden Administration's broader strategy to counter China's expanding influence. By forging democratic partnerships and strengthening alliances in the region, the U.S. aims to present a solid front of shared values and mutual interests.

While President Biden has yet to travel to the region since taking office, his administration has actively engaged with Asia, hosting leaders from Japan and South Korea in a show of the enduring priority the region holds for U.S. foreign policy.

As Vice President Harris prepares for her historic trip, the world watches closely, eagerly anticipating the next steps in the evolving relationship between the United States and Asia, a relationship that grows ever more critical in the globally connected and dynamically changing 21st century.
