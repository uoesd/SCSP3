Chris Cuomo Reportedly Targeted Fox News' Janice Dean Over Brother's COVID-19 Controversy

In a development that deepens the controversy surrounding the Cuomo family, Chris Cuomo, the former CNN anchor, is reported to have launched personal attacks against Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean. Dean, who vocally criticized former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's nursing home COVID-19 policy following the death of her in-laws from the virus, appears to have been singled out by the disgraced journalist.

Dean has been an outspoken critic of Andrew Cuomo's handling of the COVID-19 crisis, particularly the policy that required nursing homes to admit patients who had tested positive for the virus. This policy, Dean believes, directly contributed to the deaths of her in-laws, both of whom were nursing home residents at the time of their deaths.

Sources indicate that Chris Cuomo sought advice on strategies to discredit Dean, exploring ways to paint her as a "far right crazy." This move suggested an attempt to dismiss her criticisms by attributing them to partisan bias rather than substantive concerns with the policy or its outcomes.

Allegations have surfaced claiming Chris Cuomo engaged in discussions focused on attacking Dean by emphasizing her political leanings. This strategy appears to have been part of a broader effort to protect his brother's political reputation amid growing public scrutiny.

Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Andrew Cuomo, addressed these claims, stating, "I have no knowledge of such actions." His statement reflects an attempt to distance the former governor's office from the controversy surrounding these alleged efforts to discredit Dean.

Further reporting suggests that Chris Cuomo and Cuomo aide Melissa DeRosa conspired on how to undermine Dean's credibility, seeing her not merely as a grieving family member, but as a right-wing commentator aiming to damage Andrew Cuomo's political standing.

This saga adds another layer to Chris Cuomo's fall from grace. The former anchor was fired from CNN following an allegation of sexual misconduct, an incident that is reported to have occurred during his tenure at ABC News, before the allegation that precipitated his firing from CNN.

The termination came after Cuomo had already been suspended from the network. Investigations revealed that he had provided extensive assistance to his brother's team as the former governor faced sexual misconduct allegations. This assistance reportedly included using his media connections to gather information on his brother's accusers, crossing ethical boundaries for a journalist.

Chris Cuomo's efforts to help his brother navigate the scandal highlight the complexities of mixing familial loyalty with professional responsibilities. The former CNN anchor's involvement went beyond offering brotherly support, raising questions about journalistic integrity and the misuse of media influence for personal objectives.

Now, as more details emerge about Cuomo's alleged attempts to target Dean, the story underscores the challenges of balancing public accountability with personal vendettas. Dean, for her part, maintains that her criticisms of Andrew Cuomo were rooted in genuine grief and concern over policies she believes exacerbated the COVID-19 crisis in nursing homes.

This unfolding controversy sheds light not just on the Cuomo brothers' actions but on the broader issues of power, media, and accountability in times of crisis. As the situation evolves, the public will be watching closely to see how these tangled threads of politics, journalism, and personal tragedy continue to unravel.
