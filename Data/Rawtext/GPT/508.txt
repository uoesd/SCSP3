Nassau County Included in Major Disaster Declaration for Hurricane Ida Relief

In a significant announcement that brings hope and support to the residents of New York affected by Hurricane Ida, Governor Kathy Hochul, in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), declared Nassau County's inclusion in the Major Disaster Declaration. This inclusion is a pivotal measure in the state's ongoing recovery efforts, offering both Individual and Public Assistance to several New York counties battered by the storm.

Gov. Hochul expressed her gratitude towards the federal government for their support in the wake of the disaster. "I want to thank President Biden and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell for their unwavering support as we recover from the impacts of Hurricane Ida," said Gov. Hochul. "This declaration is a vital step forward in providing much-needed assistance to our communities and individuals who are struggling with the aftermath of the storm."

The assistance earmarked for New York is comprehensive, slated to support affected residents through funds allocated for housing, counseling, and legal services. This federal aid is designed to alleviate the financial burdens placed on individuals and communities as they navigate the complexities of recovery.

Echoing the sentiments of state leadership, Nassau County Executive Laura Curran emphasized her commitment to securing the disaster declaration and the importance of residents availing themselves of this assistance. "After relentless advocacy for our community's needs, I am heartened to see Nassau County included in the Major Disaster Declaration. I urge all affected residents to apply for the aid available to them," Curran elaborated.

This declaration plays a crucial role in the financial recuperation for local communities and individual New Yorkers, whose lives and livelihoods were upended by Hurricane Ida. The New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services spearheaded meticulous damage assessments, laying the groundwork for the application for federal aid.

Hurricane Ida left a wake of destruction estimated at over $140 million, damaging public infrastructure and impacting approximately 2,900 homes. To mitigate such destruction, FEMA's Public Assistance Program is set into motion to support the restoration of affected public infrastructure, ensuring communities can rebound and rebuild.

In a forward-thinking move to protect the state against future extreme weather events, Gov. Hochul announced, "We are ensuring the allocation of $378 million in hazard mitigation funding from FEMA." This funding aims to strengthen the state's infrastructure, making New York more resilient in the face of climate change.

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell remarked, "Our commitment to the people of New York in their time of need is unwavering. Together, with state and local partners, we are working diligently to ensure communities have the resources needed to recover and build back stronger."

This declaration is a beacon of hope for many, laying the foundation for a robust recovery and resilience plan post-Hurricane Ida. Affected residents and communities are encouraged to seek out the assistance provided and take the necessary steps towards recovery and reconstruction.
