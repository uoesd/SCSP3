Prince Harry Returns to the UK for Prince Philip's Funeral, Pays Heartfelt Tribute

In a solemn return to the United Kingdom, Prince Harry has arrived to attend the funeral of his grandfather, Prince Philip, who passed away at the age of 99. In compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, Harry is staying at Frogmore Cottage, the Sussexes' residence within Windsor Castle's grounds, as he observes the necessary protocols ahead of the ceremony.

Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has notably remained in California due to her pregnancy. Medical advice against her travelling at this advanced stage has led to her absence. The Sussexes recently disclosed in their intimate interview with Oprah Winfrey that they are expecting a girl this summer, adding a note of hope amidst these somber times.

In the wake of Prince Philip's passing, Prince Harry has released a poignant statement reflecting on his grandfather's enduring legacy, emphasizing his "unparalleled sense of humor, service, and honour." Harry's words paint a vivid picture of the Duke of Edinburgh as not just a public figure but a beloved family member whose influence and charisma resonated deeply within the royal family and beyond.

The prince made it a point to highlight how Prince Philip will be "sorely missed but always remembered" by his family, including Meghan, their son Archie, and their soon-to-arrive daughter. It's a touching acknowledgment, bridging the physical distance the Sussexes have with the UK during this period of mourning.

Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge and Harry's brother, also issued a statement this morning. The coordinated yet personal tributes from the brothers underscore the profound impact Prince Philip had on their lives, shedding light on the unique bond shared between the grandchildren and their grandfather.

Prince Harry fondly recollected Prince Philip as 'Grandpa', a 'master of the barbecue', 'legend of banter', and 'cheeky right 'til the end', a testament to the Duke's spirited personality and his ability to engage with people on a genuinely human level.

The world remembers Prince Philip for his long service and dedication, notably as the longest reigning consort to the Monarch. His stalwart support of Queen Elizabeth II throughout her reign, and his significant contributions to the commonwealth and numerous charitable endeavors, have left an indelible mark on the fabric of British society and beyond.

In his tribute, Harry ended with a heartfelt note of thanks and the phrase 'Per Mare, Per Terram', a nod to Prince Philip's decorated naval career and his unwavering commitment to duty and service. It echoes the deep respect and admiration that Harry holds for his grandfather, encapsulating the essence of the Duke's remarkable life and legacy.

As the royal family and the world prepare to say their final farewells, the sentiments expressed by Prince Harry serve as a poignant reminder of Prince Philip's vibrant spirit and the profound impact he had on those around him. The Duke of Edinburgh's legacy, characterized by his remarkable service, dedication, and an enduring sense of humor, will undoubtedly live on through his family, fondly remembered and deeply missed.
