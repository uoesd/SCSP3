Governor Cuomo's Office Accused of Underreporting COVID-19 Nursing Home Deaths

In a shocking revelation that has caused uproar across New York and beyond, Governor Andrew Cuomo's office has been accused of significantly underreporting the number of COVID-19 related deaths within state nursing homes during the spring of 2020. This grave allegation suggests that the underreporting was a deliberate attempt to evade a federal investigation by the Trump administration. The underreported figures have prompted widespread criticism and raised questions about the transparency and handling of the pandemic by Cuomo's administration.

At the heart of the controversy is Howard Zucker, the state health commissioner, whose directive required nursing homes to admit patients who were either infected with COVID-19 or recovering from it. This policy, critics argue, significantly contributed to the spread of the virus within these vulnerable facilities. "Our intention was to ensure that no hospital lacked the medical capacity to handle patients," Zucker defended, emphasizing that the mandate was lifted on May 10. However, by then, significant damage had been done, with official counts admitting to approximately 7,000 nursing home deaths, although external estimates suggested a number closer to 12,000. New York Attorney General Letitia James later reported that the real death toll might be closer to 13,000, underscoring the gravity of the situation. "These numbers show a more significant problem than we initially thought," James stated, highlighting the discrepancy in reported figures.

In an unguarded moment, Melissa DeRosa, Governor Cuomo's top aide, acknowledged the administration's deliberate stonewalling to avoid federal scrutiny. "We were concerned about a federal investigation and felt it was necessary to delay the release of accurate numbers," DeRosa admitted, revealing the administration's apprehensions about potential repercussions from the federal government.

Despite facing severe backlash for the handling of the pandemic, particularly in nursing homes, Governor Cuomo had initially received widespread acclaim for his leadership during the early stages of the crisis. He was celebrated nationally, even winning an Emmy in 2020 for his daily COVID-19 briefings. However, this praise has since waned in light of these allegations. It appears, however, that the Biden Justice Department is not expected to pursue any investigations into Cuomo's actions during the pandemic, leaving many to wonder about accountability and transparency within the state's handling of one of the most challenging periods in recent memory.
