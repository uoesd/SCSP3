California Preps For Third Batch of Stimulus Checks Under Golden State Stimulus Program

SACRAMENTO, Calif. – Californians have a new round of financial relief on the horizon as the state readies to send out the third batch of stimulus checks on October 5. This installment is part of the ongoing Golden State Stimulus program designed to provide economic support during the pandemic.

Though the exact size of the upcoming batch remains undisclosed, previous disbursements reached 2 million and 600,000 Californians respectively. With an estimated 9 million Californians eligible for the payments, the relief efforts are substantial. Unlike prior rounds, which focused on direct deposits, this batch will also include mailed paper checks to recipients.

The state has maintained a two-week interval schedule for sending out payments, with previous distributions on August 27 and September 17. To assist residents in determining their eligibility and potential payment amount, the California Franchise Tax Board offers a convenient online tool.

Eligibility criteria and the amount of payment vary, taking into account factors such as qualification for previous stimulus checks and whether claimants have dependents. The initiative is part of a broader $12 billion pandemic relief effort signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on July 12, targeting those hit hardest by the pandemic's economic impact.

Gov. Gavin Newsom emphasized the purpose behind the stimulus, stating, "This round of stimulus checks is part of our commitment to addressing inequity and supporting those who face the greatest hardship. We are taking significant steps to make our state more equitable and emerge from the pandemic stronger."

The Golden State Stimulus program is a cornerstone of California's effort to combat the financial downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. By distributing these funds, the state aims to alleviate some of the economic strains experienced by its residents, providing a much-needed boost for those struggling the most during these challenging times.
