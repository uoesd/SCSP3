Parents of Michigan Teen Charged in School Shooting Face Involuntary Manslaughter

PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) – In a rare legal move, charges have been filed against the parents of a Michigan teenager accused of a deadly school shooting. James and Jennifer Crumbley face involuntary manslaughter charges, with authorities contending they failed to take preventive steps despite glaring warning signs before the tragedy unfolded.

The parents of Ethan Crumbley, who is charged with murder and terrorism for the killings of four students at Oxford High School, allegedly bought him a gun and did not secure it. Additionally, they are accused of resisting school officials' efforts to remove him from the premises on the day of the attack.

"These charges are intended to hold the individuals who contributed to this tragedy accountable and also send a message about the importance of responsible gun ownership," Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald stated.

According to McDonald, the Crumbleys neglected multiple red flags, including a disturbing drawing found on their son's desk. This drawing, uncovered hours before the shooting, depicted a handgun and the words "The thoughts won't stop. Help me."

Despite these warnings, there was a resistance from the parents to take meaningful action. "The idea that a parent could read those words and also know that their son had access to a deadly weapon that they gave him is unconscionable," McDonald said.

Amid the investigation, the U.S. Marshals announced a reward for information leading to the arrest of the Crumbleys, who were missing following the filing of charges. Their attorney, Shannon Smith, however, stated they were not fleeing from law enforcement. "The Crumbleys left town on the night of the tragic shooting for their own safety. They are returning to the area to be arraigned," Smith declared.

Further reports have surfaced indicating school officials were previously alarmed by Ethan's conduct, including an incident where he was found searching for ammunition on his phone. Instead of imposing disciplinary measures, his parents were merely informed, prompting Jennifer Crumbley to text her son, "LOL. I'm not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught."

Following the mass shooting, Jennifer Crumbley texted Ethan, urging him not to proceed, while James Crumbley reported a gun missing from their home. The firearm had been openly flaunted on social media by Ethan, who had access to it despite his parents' claims of securing it.

Sheriff Mike Bouchard underscored the significance of the charges against the parents. "The actions or lack thereof of a parent who had every reason to know their son was distressed and had access to a deadly weapon are clearly negligent," Bouchard remarked.

In a press conference, Prosecutor McDonald did not rule out the possibility of levying charges against school personnel, hinting that the broader investigation is still unfolding. "We have to do better. This cannot happen again," she emphasized, stressing the need for an overhaul in how such warning signs are addressed.

The Crumbleys were instructed to find counseling for Ethan within 48 hours following the discovery of the disturbing note, a deadline they did not meet. McDonald highlighted the systemic failures that allowed the shooting to occur, from the parents' inaction to potential lapses by school officials.

As the case captures national attention, it raises critical questions about parental responsibility and the measures schools take in response to threats. The charges against James and Jennifer Crumbley mark a significant step in addressing the broader issues of gun ownership and accountability in preventing future tragedies.

The legal proceedings and compelling evidence against the Crumbleys serve as a wake-up call, underscoring the urgent need for vigilance and proactive measures by both parents and school authorities to protect students from harm.
