Innovative Locks at Oxford High School Credited with Saving Lives During Shooting

In the wake of a terrifying shooting spree at Oxford High School last week, attention has been brought to the special lockdown locks installed at the school four years ago, which likely played a significant role in saving lives. The locks, designed by Nightlock in Mt. Morris, Michigan, have seen widespread adoption, with approximately 10,000 school districts nationwide implementing the safety devices.

The device operates with a simple yet effective mechanism. A red handle, stored in a wall-mounted box, can be quickly inserted into the door, effectively barricading the entry against intruders. This design ensures that even if the glass on a door is shattered, an outside party can't reach in and unlock the door from the outside.

These critical safety devices were installed at Oxford High School back in 2017, catering to both inward and outward swinging doors, thus providing comprehensive safety solutions for different classroom setups. Tragically, during last week's incident, the alleged shooter did not manage to enter any classrooms thanks to these preventative measures; all victims were caught in hallways, underscoring a harrowing limitation of the safety devices.

Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard acknowledged the role of the safety precautions and training protocols established by Oxford Community Schools. "The layers of security and the rapid response protocols in place at Oxford High School undoubtedly saved lives," Bouchard stated.

However, Cris Ahearn, Director of Sales at Nightlock, expressed a deep emotional disturbance over the incident, reflecting on the inherent limitations of such security devices. "Our hearts break knowing that while the locks protect those inside classrooms, they can't secure individuals in the open spaces like hallways," Ahearn said, voicing a somber reality faced by many educational institutions.

This tragic event has prompted increased demand for improved security measures in schools across the nation. Nightlock has reported a surge in inquiries from school districts eager to bolster their facility's security to prevent similar incidents.

Nightlock's journey into the creation of school security devices was initially sparked by a home invasion experienced by the owners' parents. The dire circumstances surrounding the Sandy Hook shooting further propelled the company to adapt their technology for educational environments, focusing on preserving the safety of students and educators alike.

Sheriff Michael Bouchard praised the quick-thinking and preparedness of school staff during the ordeal, saying, "The combination of advanced security measures and the heroism of school staff prevented an even greater tragedy."

Cris Ahearn reiterated the importance of comprehensive safety strategies, stating, "While our devices play a crucial role, we continually advocate for wider measures that address all aspects of school safety."

As communities and schools across the country grapple with the complexities of ensuring safety in educational spaces, the tragic incident at Oxford High School has illuminated the indispensable value of preparedness and robust security apparatus like Nightlock's lockdown locks.
