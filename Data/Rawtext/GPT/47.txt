National Guard Restrictions and Delays Criticized in Capitol Riot Response

WASHINGTON (AP) – The Defense Department imposed unusual restrictions on the National Guard in the lead-up to the January 6 Capitol riot and delayed sending assistance as the violence escalated, contributing to a significant gap in the Capitol's defenses during a critical time. Maj. Gen. William Walker, Commanding General of the District of Columbia National Guard, highlighted the slow pace of the approval process that held back the deployment of National Guard troops as the Capitol was besieged by rioters.

Walker noted, "There was an unusual amount of restrictions placed on the National Guard that day. The delay in obtaining approval resulted in our troops arriving hours after the first urgent request for help." This critical delay allowed the rioters to gain further control of the situation before the National Guard's presence could be established.

Officials from the Pentagon have voiced concerns over the optics of a large National Guard presence at the Capitol, leading to restrained pre-riot preparations and deployment. Pentagon officials' hesitance underscored an overarching caution about the military's visibility, which, as events unfolded, contributed to a more chaotic situation on the ground.

Senate hearings have brought to light the considerable mishandling and lack of preparation by law enforcement in the run-up to and during the Capitol riot. During these hearings, it became evident that the FBI did not adequately share intelligence warnings of possible violence, with the Bureau's top counterterrorism official, Jill Sanborn, stating, "We work tirelessly to share information; however, the dynamic nature of the threat environment sometimes challenges our efforts."

The Capitol Police were found to have been informed of a possible plot by militia groups to breach the Capitol again, illustrating a systematic failure to address the intelligence in a way that could have prevented or mitigated the riot. Acting Chief of Police for the Metropolitan Police Department, Robert Contee, expressed his frustration with the delay, saying, "I was surprised at the reluctance to send the National Guard to the Capitol immediately. Our officers were overrun, and the National Guard could have made a significant difference in our response."

There remains a controversy over the exact timeline and the decision-making process for deploying the National Guard on January 6, with senior officials pointing fingers at one another for the security failures. This maze of accountability has made it difficult to pinpoint where the critical breakdowns in communication and command occurred.

Senior Pentagon official Robert Salesses attempted to clarify the timeline, but confusion persists about who ultimately had the authority to approve the deployment of troops. "The process was complicated, to say the least, and there were significant misunderstandings and miscommunications across all levels of government," Salesses remarked.

These revelations have prompted congressional investigations to focus more acutely on the security failures, the motivations behind the riot, and how similar incidents can be prevented in the future. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) underscored the importance of these hearings, stating, "We must understand what went wrong on January 6. The safety of our Capitol, the safety of our democracy, depends on it."

As lawmakers and officials continue to unravel the events leading to and occurring on January 6, the emphasis remains on ensuring such a breach of the Capitol—and of democracy—never happens again.
