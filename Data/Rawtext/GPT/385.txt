Facebook Suffers $99.75 Million Loss Due to Major Outage Amidst Whistleblower Accusations

Facebook faced a double whammy on Monday as it contended with a significant outage across its services and faced fallout from whistleblower accusations. The tech giant estimated a whopping $99.75 million revenue loss due to the service disruption that affected Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger from approximately 11:30 a.m. ET to just after 7 p.m. ET.

Calculating the financial toll based on the company's Q2 earnings, which boils down to $319.6 million per day or $13.3 million per hour, the outage represents a dent in Facebook's overall revenues. Despite the significant number, this constitutes a minor impact in the grand scheme of the tech giant's financial health.

Further intensifying the company's challenges, Facebook's stock took a 4.9% dive following explosive revelations from whistleblower Frances Haugen. Haugen, a former product manager at Facebook, came forward in a "60 Minutes" interview revealing herself as the source behind the damning leaks of internal Facebook research to The Wall Street Journal and lawmakers.

The documents Haugen leaked suggested Facebook prioritized "profit over safety," particularly spotlighting the company's decision to deactivate safeguards against misinformation and offensive content post the 2020 U.S. presidential election. She directly linked these decisions to the turmoil of the Jan. 6 Capitol Riots. "The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook. And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimize for its own interests, like making more money," Haugen disclosed.

While Facebook has downplayed the significance of the leaked documents, Haugen's accusations have sparked a renewed debate over the social media company's responsibility and the balance between profit and public safety.
