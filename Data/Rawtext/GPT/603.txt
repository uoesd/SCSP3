Vice President Kamala Harris Satisfies Sweet Tooth at Chicago's Brown Sugar Bakery

In a delightful detour on her journey from California to Washington, D.C., Vice President Kamala Harris made a warmly received stop at Chicago's renowned Brown Sugar Bakery. The visit was not just a moment of indulgence but also shone a spotlight on a cherished local business that embodies resilience, community, and the sweet taste of success.

Founded in 2004 by Stephanie Hart, Brown Sugar Bakery has become a staple for those craving southern-style desserts in the Windy City. The bakery has garnered notable acclaim over the years, not just for its delectable treats but also for the story of hard work and determination that underpins its success.

During her visit, Vice President Harris declared her affection for German chocolate cake, dubbing it her favorite as she ordered a slice. But the indulgence didn't stop there. In a gesture as generous as her smile, Harris didn't return empty-handed but left with trays of cupcakes for her continued journey back to the capital.

The story behind Brown Sugar Bakery's success is as sweet as its offerings. Particularly celebrated is the bakery's caramel cake, a recipe that Hart learned from an elderly lady in Arkansas, which has become a cherished delight among patrons.

This tale of growth saw another chapter with Hart's expansion of her culinary empire. In a display of faith in her endeavors and the community's support, Hart purchased the Cupid Candies factory, bolstered by a $500,000 state grant—a testament to her ambition and vision.

Despite facing the formidable challenges posed by the pandemic, including temporary closures, Brown Sugar Bakery has continued to thrive, buoyed by unwavering support from the community. This support was underscored when the Local Initiatives Support Corporation awarded the bakery a $10,000 grant, a moment of triumph shared on 'Good Morning America'.

Devotion to Brown Sugar Bakery is palpable, with customers often braving the cold, queuing outside just to get a taste of Hart's famous desserts—a true testament to the bakery's place in the hearts of Chicagoans.

Moreover, the bakery's reputation and appeal have extended beyond the local, with nationwide shipping bringing a piece of Chicago to dessert lovers across the country.

Stephanie Hart reflects on the Vice President's visit with warmth and gratitude, noting, "Her choosing Brown Sugar Bakery for a slice of cake is a sweet call that resonates deeply. It's not just about cake or dessert but recognizing the spirit of this place, the community."

As Vice President Harris's visit to Brown Sugar Bakery exemplifies, sometimes the sweetest calls are those that spotlight a blend of culinary delight, resilience, and the power of community. For Hart and her bakery, it's clear that the recipe for success includes generous measures of all three.
