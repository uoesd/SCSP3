Harry and Meghan Bid Farewell to Social Media amidst Online Hate

In a bold move that has surprised many, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry, and Meghan Markle, have decided to abandon social media platforms. Once avid users with a following of over 10 million on their official royal Instagram account @sussexroyal, the couple has grown disillusioned by the persistent "hate" they've encountered, especially on platforms like Instagram.

According to a report from The Sunday Times, Harry and Meghan have no intentions of engaging in social media for their non-profit venture, Archewell. Furthermore, the couple does not foresee a personal return to these platforms. This decision underscores a significant shift in their approach to public communication and follows a period of intense scrutiny and criticism both as members of the royal family and as public figures.

The couple's disenchantment with social media comes at a time when these platforms are increasingly under fire for their role in political and social events. Notably, the controversial indefinite suspension of former US President Donald Trump from several platforms has sparked a global conversation about the power and responsibility of tech giants in shaping public discourse.

Harry and Meghan's decision to step away from social media is part of their broader journey towards establishing a new life in the United States. Having stepped down as senior royals, the couple has been vocal about their desire for financial independence and the ability to chart their own course free from the constraints of traditional royal duties.

Meghan, in particular, has been open about the toll that online abuse has taken on her mental health. In a stark revelation, she claimed to have been the "most trolled person in the world" in 2019, highlighting the dark side of social media fame.

Amidst these challenges, Archewell, their non-profit organization, aims to drive systemic cultural change. The couple plans to achieve their goals through a combination of non-profit work and media production, all without the backing of an official social media presence.

In line with their mission, Harry and Meghan have inked lucrative deals with Spotify and Netflix to produce podcasts and documentaries that resonate with their values. Through these partnerships, they hope to leverage traditional and new media to spread their message of empathy and social justice.

Interestingly, the couple's exit from social media contradicts their earlier statements, in which they expressed a desire to continue using these platforms post their royal exit. This reversal highlights the evolving nature of their public strategy and their ongoing struggle to find a balance between engagement and personal well-being.

By relinquishing their social media accounts, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are setting a precedent for public figures, showing that it is possible to have an impactful presence without succumbing to the pressures and pitfalls of online platforms. Their decision underscores a commitment to mental health and well-being over the fleeting allure of digital popularity.
