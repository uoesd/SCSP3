Gun Safety on Set: Former Gunfight Actor's Mission After On-Set Injury

In a revealing interview, Robert Bradley, once a western gunfight actor who suffered a severe injury from a prop gun, has emerged as a vocal advocate for stringent safety measures on movie sets. Bradley's career took a dramatic turn during a staged show in Maggie Valley amusement park in 2013 when he was accidentally shot in the leg with a slug from a shotgun. The projectile lodged perilously close to his femoral artery, leaving doctors with no choice but to leave it in situ due to the high risk of removal.

The incident transformed Bradley's perspective on firearm safety in the entertainment industry. Now an armorer on movie sets, Bradley has taken his harrowing experience and channeled it into ensuring the safe handling of firearms during production. Currently serving as an armorer for the filming of "Silent Night in Algona" in Iowa, Bradley is implementing rigorous protocols to guarantee that the tragedy he endured is not repeated.

Central to Bradley's safety guidelines is the absolute prohibition of live ammunition on set. This rule, seemingly straightforward, is a critical measure in the prevention of accidents. However, Bradley's move towards strict adherence to safety norms has been further motivated by the tragic shooting incident on the set of "Rust."

The "Rust" incident, where cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot, has captivated the film industry's attention toward the imperative of gun safety. The investigation into the incident is primarily focused on the actions of the film's rookie armorer and the assistant director, raising questions about the accountability of professionals responsible for weapon safety on sets.

Bradley strongly advocates for charges against the individual who handed the gun to actor Alec Baldwin, assuring it was safe when it was not. He underscores the adage that firearms, loaded or not, should never be pointed at anyone on a movie set, a basic tenet of gun safety ignored in this tragic case.

The repercussions of the "Rust" incident are still unfolding, and Bradley is closely monitoring the potential for significant safety changes in film production practices. His personal ordeal and the high-profile nature of the "Rust" tragedy serve as sobering reminders of the risks associated with inadequate safety protocols. As someone who has lived through the consequences of such oversight, Bradley's voice adds a critical perspective to the ongoing dialogue about how to ensure such tragedies are never repeated.
