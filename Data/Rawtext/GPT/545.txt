Tragic Outcome: Kabul Airport Attack Linked to Prisoner Release Amid Chaotic US Withdrawal

In a revelation that underscores the chaotic final days of America's longest war, it has been confirmed that the ISIS-K suicide bomber responsible for the devastating attack at Kabul airport in late August, which resulted in the deaths of 13 US service members and scores of Afghans, was released from Parwan prison near Kabul merely days before executing the attack. The tragic incident casts a stark light on the dire circumstances surrounding the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The capture and subsequent release of prisoners, including members of the notorious ISIS-K group, took place as the Taliban seized control of key installations, including the Parwan prison at Bagram air base and Pul-e-Charkhi prison near Kabul. The assault at Kabul's airport, carried out by Abdul Rehman Al-Loghri as identified by two US officials and Rep. Ken Calvert (California Republican), came during a feverish evacuation effort and illustrated the dire struggle to secure the airport's perimeter amid rising chaos.

"The bomber's release from custody just days before he carried out the attack is a glaring example of the catastrophic failure that beset the entire withdrawal operation," Rep. Ken Calvert stated, linking the sequence of events directly to the operational mishaps of the withdrawal process. This sentiment echoes widespread criticism towards the management of the withdrawal, especially concerning key strategic decisions.

One of the focal points of criticism has been the decision to abandon Bagram air base, a vital military complex that played a central role throughout the US military presence in Afghanistan. At the time of its handover, officials estimated that Bagram housed around 5,000 prisoners, the majority of whom were identified as terrorists. "The abandonment of such a crucial asset without ensuring a secure transition truly boggles the mind," Calvert added, vocalizing a common critique.

The rapid fall of Afghan districts and the swift takeover of Kabul by the Taliban only accelerated in the wake of the US withdrawal, raising alarms about the future stability of the region. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley issued a stern warning about the situation, hinting at the long-term implications: "We could see the reconstitution of al Qaeda or ISIS-K within 6 to 36 months. The threat is real, and the stakes are high."

Addressing the controversy surrounding the decision to leave Bagram, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin defended the move, emphasizing strategic priorities. "Our primary objective was to ensure the protection of the US embassy. The hard choices made were in service of that goal," Austin elucidated, attempting to clarify the administration's stance during those tumultuous final days.

As the dust settles on the tragic Kabul airport attack, the intricate web of decisions, movements, and outcomes highlights the multifaceted challenges faced during the withdrawal, underscoring the complex legacy of America's involvement in Afghanistan.
