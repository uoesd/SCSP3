Experts Suggest Tiger Woods May Have Been Asleep Before Devastating Crash

Forensic car accident experts are raising questions about the circumstances surrounding Tiger Woods' recent car accident, suggesting the golf legend might have been asleep or not paying attention in the moments leading up to the crash. Despite initial assessments that the accident was simply that—an accident—evidence now points to inattention rather than excessive speed as the cause of the crash.

Jonathan Cherney, a consultant and expert witness for car accident analysis, noted, "The absence of skid marks could indicate that Woods was not paying adequate attention to the road." Initially, it was speculated that the lack of braking evidence could have been due to excessive speed, but the vehicle's anti-lock brakes could also explain the absence.

According to the accident reconstruction, Woods' vehicle was traveling straight on a curved road, indicating a failure to adjust steering. "The fact that the vehicle went straight instead of following the road suggests a lack of conscious control," stated Felix Lee, an accident reconstruction expert with the Expert Institute. Subsequently, the car went off the road, struck a tree, and rolled over, causing significant damage and breaking Woods' lower right leg.

Rami Hashish, principal at the National Biomechanics Institute, theorizes there was a late attempt to brake, based on the vehicle's final resting position and damage. "This might suggest Woods was possibly unconscious or asleep until off-road," Hashish commented.

Despite these expert analyses, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva and other officials swiftly labeled the crash an accident. Villanueva stated, "We have ruled out impairment and consider this an accident." However, this conclusion was drawn before a thorough analysis of the vehicle's black box data or Woods' medical data to check for medication.

In 2017, Woods was found asleep at the wheel, with a mix of substances in his system. This prior incident raises questions about whether medication could have played a role in the recent crash. "Without looking into all possible factors, it's premature to rule out other causes," Sheriff's Deputy Graciela Medrano said.

Experts are now questioning the quick determination to label the crash as nothing more than an accident, suggesting negligence might have played a role. "It's crucial to consider all possible factors, including driver inattention or unconsciousness," Lee emphasized.

Tiger Woods is currently recovering from surgery to repair the damage to his lower right leg. While he remains in good spirits, there have been no further updates on his condition. The incident has sparked a broader discussion about the importance of thorough accident investigations, especially when initial evidence may point towards alternative explanations beyond mere accident. As this story develops, more details are expected to emerge, shedding light on the true causes behind this unfortunate turn of events.
