Nikki Haley Speaks Out: Criticizes Trump's Role in Capitol Riot and Predicts His Political Demise

In a recent revelation, Nikki Haley, the former UN Ambassador, has openly criticized former President Donald Trump for his conduct leading up to and following the Capitol riot on January 6. Reflecting on Trump's attacks on former Vice President Mike Pence, Haley expressed her grievances, stating, "When I tell you I'm angry, it's an understatement."

Haley went on to predict that regardless of the outcome of Trump's second impeachment trial, his political career is effectively finished. This marks a significant shift in her stance towards the former president, signaling potential changes in her political approach as she eyes a run for president in 2024.

For months, Haley did not publicly challenge Trump's false claims of election fraud. However, she had believed that Trump would eventually accept his defeat after his legal challenges failed. But Trump's actions and rhetoric leading up to the Capitol riot took an irreversible toll.

The former ambassador emphasized the potency of Trump's words on his followers, especially his calls for Pence to halt the certification of Joe Biden's Electoral College victory. "Mike has been nothing but loyal to that man. He's been nothing but a good friend of that man... I am so disappointed in the fact that [despite] the loyalty and friendship he had with Mike Pence, he would do that to him," Haley remarked on Trump's betrayal.

Haley predicts that Trump is unlikely to seek federal office again, highlighting his loss of influence and the severe consequences of the Capitol riot. She pointed out, "He's not going to run for federal office again."

Despite her criticism of Trump's recent actions, Haley sees the impeachment trial as a 'waste of time' and suggests Trump will suffer isolation and significant business losses instead. Politico's Tim Alberta suggests that Haley's critiques and her interviews with people who know her are all part of her preparation for a potential 2024 presidential run.

As Haley navigates the complex political landscape post-Trump era, her candid criticism of the former president represents a notable departure from her previous support, underscoring the evolving dynamics within the Republican Party as they look towards the future.
