"Cuomo Prime Time" Hits Record Low Viewership Amidst Cuomo Scandals

In a significant ratings slump, "Cuomo Prime Time" experienced its lowest-rated week for the year between April 5 and April 9, managing to average only 1.2 million viewers. This represents a substantial 45 percent decline in viewership when compared to the week of Jan. 25, highlighting a troubling trend for one of CNN's prime time programs.

The drop in viewership for Chris Cuomo's show occurs amidst a series of scandals involving his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Chris Cuomo himself came under fire when it was reported that he received prioritized coronavirus testing by his brother's administration, raising questions about journalistic ethics and conflicts of interest.

Governor Andrew Cuomo, on the other hand, has been embroiled in controversies ranging from accusations of sexual harassment by multiple women to allegations of covering up nursing home COVID-19 deaths. These scandals have not only impacted the Governor's political career but have also spilled over to his brother's television program.

CNN previously faced criticism for allowing Chris Cuomo to conduct a series of interviews with his brother Governor Cuomo during the early stages of the pandemic. These interviews, which were widely criticized for their lack of seriousness and potential conflict of interest, created a unique family dynamic on air that eventually became controversial.

In response to the growing scrutiny, CNN announced that Chris Cuomo would no longer be covering news related to his brother on "Cuomo Prime Time". This decision, however, seems to have done little to salvage the program's viewership numbers.

Among the key demographics for advertisers, adults aged 25 to 54, the decline was even more pronounced. "Cuomo Prime Time" saw a staggering 55 percent drop in viewership, indicating a significant erosion of its audience base.

In a surprising twist, Fox News' "Gutfeld!", which premiered on April 5, has outperformed every CNN program in the ratings race. The show has not only bested its cable news competitors but has also surpassed viewership numbers of several broadcast network late-night shows, marking a notable achievement for Fox News.

This development underscores the volatile nature of television ratings and the impact that external controversies can have on a program's viewership. As "Cuomo Prime Time" struggles to regain its footing, the rising success of "Gutfeld!" demonstrates the shifting landscapes within cable news and late-night programming.

The events surrounding Governor Cuomo have undoubtedly cast a shadow over his brother's program, prompting discussions about journalistic integrity and the challenges of covering news when personal relationships are involved. As the Cuomo scandals continue to unfold, the future of "Cuomo Prime Time" remains uncertain, with viewership trends indicating a rocky path ahead.

For now, "Cuomo Prime Time" faces the daunting task of reconnecting with its audience amidst a backdrop of scandal and controversy, a challenge that will test the resilience of its host and the loyalty of its viewers.
