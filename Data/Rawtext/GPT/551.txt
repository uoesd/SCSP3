Afghanistan Faces Rising Threat from ISIS-K Amid Taliban Rule

Sept 23 (Reuters) – Taliban forces in Afghanistan are confronting a resurgent threat from the Islamic State in Khorasan (ISIS-K), as the extremist group adopts guerrilla tactics reminiscent of those once used by the Taliban against Western forces. Recent deadly attacks, including a bomb blast at Kabul airport and several explosions in Jalalabad, have underscored the group's efforts to destabilize the country under Taliban control.

The Taliban, having seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021, are now facing a challenge from ISIS-K, a group that seems determined to exploit any vulnerability in the Taliban's governance. Despite the Taliban's efforts to project control, these attacks have raised questions about the nascent government's capacity to ensure the nation's security.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has sought to downplay the threat posed by ISIS-K, asserting that the group does not represent a significant challenge to Taliban rule. "Our Mujahideen forces are prepared and ISIS will be eliminated soon," Mujahid told Reuters. However, comments from Taliban field commanders tell a different story, revealing deeper concerns over ISIS-K's tactics, including the deployment of sticky bombs – magnetic bombs attached to vehicles that can be detonated remotely.

Since reaching its peak around 2018, ISIS-K has suffered significant losses at the hands of both Taliban forces and U.S. airstrikes, leading to a noticeable decline in its activities. Nonetheless, recent operations suggest the group is far from defeated. Just this week, Taliban security personnel announced the killing of three ISIS-K operatives, signaling ongoing confrontations between the two factions.

Alarmingly, some analysts and United Nations reports suggest that the Taliban's return to power could reinvigorate extremist factions in the region, including ISIS-K and al Qaeda. The estimated strength of ISIS-K, while considerably smaller than that of the Taliban, is believed to be under 2,000 fighters. This number includes recruits drawn from former Taliban ranks and fighters from the Pakistani Taliban (TTP).

Financial and logistical support from ISIS's parent organization in Syria has reportedly dwindled, yet ISIS-K remains a tenacious adversary. A recent U.N. report highlights potential internal divisions within the Taliban that could push some of its members into the arms of ISIS-K, potentially strengthening the latter's capabilities.

"The evolving dynamics within Afghanistan could potentially breathe new life into groups like ISIS-K," said Rohan Gunaratna, a professor of security studies at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. "It's a worrying development that could undermine the stability not just of Afghanistan, but of the entire region."

Despite their numerical superiority, Taliban forces must grapple with the reality of a determined and adaptable enemy in ISIS-K. The group's guerrilla tactics, willingness to target civilians, and potential to attract disaffected Taliban fighters pose a complex challenge to Taliban rule.

The stakes are high for the Taliban, who are eager to demonstrate their capability to govern and maintain order. Yet, the shadow of ISIS-K looms large, threatening to ignite further conflict and instability in a nation already scarred by decades of war.

As Afghanistan navigates its post-U.S. withdrawal reality, the interplay between the Taliban and ISIS-K will be critical in shaping the country's future. With the Taliban under pressure to deliver security and governance, the resilience of ISIS-K will test the limits of their authority and the international community's response to Afghanistan's evolving conflict landscape.
