Harris Discusses Challenges and Solutions for the Region in Exclusive WSAZ Interview

HUNTINGTON/CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) – In an exclusive interview with WSAZ's Amanda Barren, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke candidly about the myriad challenges facing our region in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Highlighting the administration's commitment to economic recovery, Harris detailed the components of the American Rescue Plan (ARP), which aims to provide significant financial relief to Americans through mechanisms like the $1,400 stimulus checks.

The Vice President expressed that beyond individual relief, the ARP is designed to bolster the economy through small business support, vital education funding, eviction and foreclosure moratoriums, and extensions on unemployment benefits crucial for those displaced by the pandemic's economic fallout.

Confronting concerns over job losses in traditional energy sectors, Harris underscored the administration's innovative approaches towards retraining workers. "We have to provide new opportunities for our workers, including reclaiming abandoned land mines, capping oil and gas wells, and turning our focus towards sustainable energy solutions," Harris stated, aiming to align job creation with environmental stewardship.

The conversation touched upon legislative pushbacks, including the POWER Act, introduced by House Republicans and Senator Shelley Moore-Capito, which opposes President Biden's executive orders on energy. Senator Capito commented, "Our legislation seeks to protect the jobs and livelihoods of the hardworking men and women in the energy sector who feel overlooked by these executive decisions."

Harris remained steadfast, emphasizing that the administration is focused on job creation while addressing climate change without negatively impacting existing leases. The Vice President also addressed concerns regarding the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, acknowledging states like West Virginia for their efficient vaccination efforts despite their small population. "Our aim is to vaccinate everyone, with a goal of 100 million vaccinations in our administration's first 100 days," she elaborated.

Further discussing the ARP's scope, Harris highlighted efforts to combat child poverty, exacerbated by the pandemic. In closing, Vice President Harris underscored the need for unity, stating, "Although we are a Democratic administration, we are here to serve all Americans, regardless of political affiliation."
