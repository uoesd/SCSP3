Chicago's Own Lights Up the Sky for Inauguration Day: A Spectacular Display by Strictly FX

When President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were sworn in on January 20, the night sky was illuminated in celebration, showcasing a spectacular fireworks display designed by Chicago-founded Strictly FX. Known for its expertise in pyrotechnics for rock shows and major events, the company, despite relocating its headquarters to Nashville in 2018, continues to operate in Chicago and California. This time, their talent contributed to a historic event, marking a memorable day in American history.

Adam Biscow, the designer from Strictly FX responsible for the Biden-Harris Inauguration Day fireworks, highlighted the team effort that went into creating the show. "It was an incredible honor to be involved, and we wanted to ensure that we created something that was truly memorable. We worked closely with the entire event team to create a display that we hoped would resonate with those watching," Biscow said. This show was not only about celebrating the new administration but also about marking a piece of history through the art of fireworks.

The display was massive, utilizing about 20,000 shells and being carefully choreographed to Katy Perry's performance of "Firework." To ensure the show's success from every angle, the team utilized two separate launch zones. This careful planning ensured that viewers at home would get the best possible view while also protecting the National Mall's grass, which could have suffered damage from the fireworks.

The design aimed to highlight the aesthetics of the Washington Monument, combining vibrant colors and large bursts to create breathtaking visuals. According to Biscow, the planning for this grand display began right after the November election, demonstrating the team's dedication and commitment to bringing their vision to life.

A crew of 26 from Strictly FX, alongside partners from Garden State Fireworks, was tasked with setting up the display. Chris Santore of Garden State Fireworks expressed admiration for the collaboration, "Working with Strictly FX on such an important occasion was an incredible experience. The level of detail and planning that went into this was phenomenal."

The synchronization of the fireworks with Katy Perry's performance was paramount to the display's success. Biscow mentioned, "We had cues set that would not launch until Katy reached a specific verse in the song. This level of synchronization is what sets apart a good fireworks display from a spectacular one."

The fireworks display was widely praised by experts within the pyrotechnics industry for its execution and scale. Matt Peterson, a designer at Melrose Pyrotechnics, shared a related anecdote about a planned but ultimately canceled fireworks display for Obama's election victory. "It's fascinating to see how fireworks can be such a powerful symbol of celebration and unity. The Biden-Harris display, with its complexity and beauty, really set a new standard."

The inauguration fireworks by Strictly FX became a beacon of celebration, not only for those present but for viewers nationwide. It reminded many of the power of coming together to mark a significant moment in history.

This event underscores Chicago's lasting impact on major events, with Strictly FX representing the city's innovative spirit and technical expertise. As Adam Biscow puts it, "Every show we do is about creating a moment that people will remember. With the inauguration, we knew we had a unique opportunity to be part of history, and everyone on the team was committed to making it as magnificent as possible."

The Biden-Harris Inauguration fireworks display leaves a lasting impression of what can be achieved when creativity, technical skill, and a profound sense of history come together. It also showcases the critical role Chicago continues to play on the national stage, even from afar.
