Federal Prisons Nationwide on Lockdown Ahead of Biden Inauguration

NEW YORK (AP) – In an unprecedented move aimed at ensuring security ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, all federal prisons across the United States have been placed on lockdown. The Bureau of Prisons has confirmed that this stringent measure affects over 120 facilities nationwide, commencing at 12 a.m. Saturday.

The decision to impose a nationwide lockdown on federal prisons comes as a precautionary measure in light of recent events around the country, which have raised concerns about potential unrest. According to officials, the lockdown was not triggered by any specific incidents within the prison facilities themselves but rather by an abundance of caution during a time of heightened national tension.

Shane Fausey, President of the Council of Prison Locals, emphasized the significance of this move, stating, "This measure is being taken to ensure the safety and security of our facilities, staff, and inmates. It is a necessary response to potential threats during this crucial period."

The Bureau of Prisons, under the U.S. Department of Justice, made the announcement about the lockdown after inmates had already been secured in their cells, leaving many unaware of the situation until after the fact. During the lockdown, inmates will have limited access to essential amenities such as showers, phones, and email but will be permitted to carry out basic activities.

Justin Long, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons, clarified the procedures during the lockdown, "Inmates will still be able to access certain facilities and maintain a limited level of communication with the outside world. We are committed to ensuring that, despite the lockdown, inmates' welfare is looked after."

Notably, this is the second time a nationwide lockdown has been declared across federal prisons. The previous instance occurred in April, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the severity with which the Bureau of Prisons is treating the current situation.

In an additional step to reinforce security, the Bureau of Prisons is relocating its Special Operations Response Teams to Washington, D.C., in anticipation of the inauguration. These teams, specialized in managing prison emergencies, are being positioned to offer support and ensure public safety during the upcoming event.

"Coordination with the Justice Department is underway to deploy these teams as needed," said Long. "Our priority is to maintain order and prevent any disruptions during the inauguration."

Amid the lockdown, a potential health concern has emerged at a federal lockup in Mendota, California, where a case of tuberculosis has been reported. This development has added another layer of complexity to managing prison facilities during the lockdown.

Aaron McGlothin, Local Union President at the Federal Prison in California, provided insight into the situation, "We are closely monitoring the health concerns at Mendota and taking all necessary precautions. The lockdown complicates our response, but the safety and health of inmates and staff remain our top priority."

As the country prepares for President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, these comprehensive security measures illustrate the government's efforts to maintain peace and prevent any potential threats. While the lockdown and deployment of special teams indicate the seriousness of the situation, officials assure the public that every step is being taken to safeguard both the inauguration and the nation's prison facilities.
