Colin Powell, Trailblazing General and Diplomat, Dies at 84 From Covid Complications

WASHINGTON – Colin Powell, the groundbreaking former U.S. Secretary of State and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has passed away at the age of 84 due to complications from Covid-19, a family spokesperson announced today. Despite being fully vaccinated, Powell's battle with the virus was complicated by underlying conditions, including Parkinson's disease and multiple myeloma, a kind of blood cancer. Powell's distinguished career saw him becoming the nation's first Black national security advisor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and secretary of State, breaking barriers and setting precedents for years to come.

Tributes poured in from across the political spectrum, reflecting Powell's impactful career and character. "Laura and I are deeply saddened by the passing of Colin Powell," said former President George W. Bush. "He was a great public servant, starting with his time as a soldier during Vietnam. Many Presidents relied on General Powell's counsel and experience." Former President Barack Obama recalled Powell's "legacy of standing up for what he believed was right," even when it was hard, while Condoleezza Rice, Powell's successor at the State Department, lauded him for having "defended this nation and its highest ideals, even when that meant taking a path that was lonelier than the one less traveled."

President Joe Biden ordered flags to be lowered in Powell's honor, remembering him as someone who "embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat." Biden's statement underscored Powell's influence, not just military and political realms, but also in the diverse paths he forged. Despite Powell's regret over his role in advocating for the Iraq War under false pretenses of weapons of mass destruction, his contributions to American society and global politics remain indelibly influential. The son of Jamaican immigrants, Powell's journey from the streets of New York to the corridors of power epitomizes the American Dream, made all the more poignant by his groundbreaking achievements and complex legacy.
