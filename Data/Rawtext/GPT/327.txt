EVER ACE: The New Behemoth of the Seas Makes History at the Suez Canal

In an event marking a new era for maritime trade and engineering, the world's largest container ship, EVER ACE, successfully navigated through the Suez Canal on its maiden voyage. Built by Samsung Heavy Industries for Evergreen Marine Corporation, EVER ACE is leading the way into the future of cargo transportation.

The ship is not just another addition to the global fleet; it is the first of a series of 12 groundbreaking container ships ordered by Evergreen. With a colossal carrying capacity of 23,992 Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs), it has dethroned the HMM Algeciras to become the largest container ship in the world. Measuring 400 meters in length and 61.53 meters in width, and with a weight of approximately 235,000 tons, EVER ACE is a marvel of modern shipbuilding.

The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) played a crucial role in the vessel's historic crossing, providing expert navigation support to ensure safe passage. This successful transit not only underscores EVER ACE's cutting-edge design but also highlights the Suez Canal's capability of accommodating the increasing size of modern container ships.

Launching from the Port of Taipei, Taiwan, and setting its course for Rotterdam, Netherlands, EVER ACE began its journey with high anticipation. The ship is slated to reach its destination on September 4, setting a new benchmark for shipping efficiency and environmental responsibility.

Interestingly, Evergreen also owns the Ever Given, a ship that made headlines in March for a different reason. It famously blocked the Suez Canal, causing significant interruptions in global trade. However, the smooth passage of EVER ACE through the Canal reflects both the lessons learned and the advancements achieved in maritime logistics.

The arrival of EVER ACE and its sister ships promises to reshape the landscape of global shipping. By pushing the boundaries of what is possible, Evergreen Marine Corporation demonstrates its commitment to innovation and environmental stewardship, ensuring a safer, more efficient future for the maritime industry.
