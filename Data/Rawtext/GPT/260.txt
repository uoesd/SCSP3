Biden Administration Announces Comprehensive COVID-19 Vaccination Policies to Bolster U.S. Recovery

Washington D.C. – In an unprecedented leap towards combating the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden Administration today announced that 70% of adult Americans are now fully vaccinated, a significant increase from less than one percent at the outset of President Biden's tenure. Building on this momentum, the administration is introducing two pivotal vaccination policies designed to further escalate vaccination rates across the nation, covering over 100 million workers.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is set to enforce a directive requiring employers with more than 100 employees to ensure their workforce is either fully vaccinated or undergoes weekly testing. Furthermore, this mandate includes provisions for paid time off for employees to get vaccinated and requires masking for those not fully vaccinated. Simultaneously, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will mandate that health care workers in facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs be fully vaccinated. These groundbreaking rules, set to take effect by January 4, 2022, seek to safeguard the health of American workers, reduce hospitalizations, save lives, and robustly enhance the economy.

Evidence from organizations that have already implemented vaccination mandates shows a significant impact, increasing vaccination rates by over 20 percentage points. These new policies are predicted by economists to catalyze a faster and stronger economic recovery, as they alleviate the burden of COVID-19 on businesses and the healthcare system alike.

Moreover, the Biden Administration's policies stand firm against any state or local laws that attempt to countermand the federal requirements, ensuring that employers across the nation have the authority to require vaccinations, implement mask mandates, or conduct testing without interference. This bold approach underscores the administration's commitment to driving the nation towards a post-pandemic era, ensuring the safety of American workers and the stability of the economy are paramount.
