Jimmie Johnson Inspired by Tom Brady as He Takes on IndyCar Challenge

ST. PETERSBURG – Racing icon Jimmie Johnson is looking to NFL superstar Tom Brady for inspiration as he embraces the new challenge of transitioning from NASCAR to IndyCar racing. Johnson, who will turn 46 in September, has been drawing parallels between his career and that of Brady, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' quarterback known for winning seven Super Bowl titles, the same number of championships Johnson has secured in NASCAR.

Johnson, set to compete in the upcoming Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, admires Brady's ability to continue excelling in the NFL at 43. The racing veteran sees Brady's success as a powerful message to athletes, particularly those in their 40s, highlighting the potential to compete and win at the highest levels, regardless of age.

The decorated NASCAR driver has shown his willingness to face new challenges head-on by moving to IndyCar racing. This want for new experiences mirrors Brady's own journey when the quarterback made the significant decision to leave the New England Patriots for the Buccaneers, ultimately leading his new team to a Super Bowl victory.

Johnson made his IndyCar debut, finishing 19th, and now looks forward to competing in St. Petersburg, a race he's eagerly anticipated since entering the series. He finds Brady's work ethic and his triumph in winning a Super Bowl after changing teams particularly inspiring as he navigates this next chapter in his racing career.

The Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg promises to be a thrilling event, where Johnson will have the opportunity to showcase his adaptability and skill in a new racing format. Race organizers are preparing to welcome up to 20,000 fans per day, with ticket sales available in advance only, ensuring that enthusiasts have the chance to witness the highly anticipated competition while adhering to safety protocols.

Gates will be open at the intersections of First Avenue SE and First Street SE, and Second Street S and Fifth Avenue S, allowing fans access to witness the events firsthand. The IndyCar series has scheduled qualifying for 1:45 p.m. Saturday, with the main race set to start at 12:42 p.m. Sunday. Fans who are unable to attend in person can catch the broadcast on NBC, ensuring they don't miss out on the action.

As Johnson gears up for the race, his admiration for Brady's achievements and resilience serves as a guiding light, proving that age is but a number when it comes to pursuing greatness in the competitive world of sports.
