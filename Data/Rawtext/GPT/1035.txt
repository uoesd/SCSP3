Settlement Ensures Griddy Energy Customers Won't Pay Sky-High Bills from February's Winter Storm

In a landmark settlement announced by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, customers of Griddy Energy caught in the financial whirlwind of last February's devastating winter storm will not be on the hook for the astronomically high electricity bills that ensued. The decision comes as a sigh of relief to many Texans who faced unprecedented financial strain amid the crisis.

The winter storm in question not only left millions within the state without power but also accounted for at least 210 deaths, marking it as one of the most severe weather events in Texas history. In the aftermath, the spotlight turned to Griddy Energy's billing practices, prompting legal action from the state's Attorney General. "My office took swift action to ensure Griddy's deceptive practices were halted, and this settlement achieves that by holding Griddy accountable," Paxton said, emphasizing the importance of transparency for Texas consumers.

Griddy Energy, which offered a wholesale electricity rate to customers, saw their model backfire spectacularly during the storm as energy prices surged. Bills skyrocketed, leaving customers facing exorbitant charges. The fallout from the storm and the ensuing public outcry forced Griddy into seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Under the terms of the settlement, former Griddy customers are released from any outstanding balances, with an option to opt out if they choose. Furthermore, those who managed to pay off their bills during this tumultuous period are given a pathway to seek reimbursement via the bankruptcy court process.

Additionally, the agreement includes stringent stipulations to prevent Griddy and its parent company from engaging in misleading advertising practices in the future, ensuring greater transparency and reliability in their services.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton heralded the settlement as a significant victory for the state's residents, affirming his commitment to their protection. "I am satisfied with this settlement that holds Griddy accountable and prevents future misleading practices. Protecting Texans is my top priority, and this outcome ensures that consumers are respected and not exploited," Paxton stated.

The settlement marks a hopeful conclusion to a challenging chapter for many Texans, providing a clear message on the importance of accountability and consumer protection in the energy sector.
