Fact Check: Misleading Comparisons Between Colonial Pipeline Hack and Unsubstantiated Election Fraud Claims

In a world increasingly reliant on technology, the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure and the integrity of our electoral systems are both of paramount importance. However, recent claims circulating on social media seek to conflate two distinct issues: the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline and unfounded allegations of widespread fraud in the November 2020 election. These comparisons are misleading and exploit concerns over one issue to erroneously cast doubt on the other.

On May 7, the Colonial Pipeline, a critical piece of infrastructure that supplies fuel across the Eastern United States, was targeted in a ransomware attack. This cyberattack involved malicious software encrypting data on the pipeline's information technology (IT) systems, effectively halting operations and creating widespread concern over fuel supply disruptions.

Ransomware attacks are a growing concern worldwide, often targeting corporations and hospitals to encrypt data and extort ransom payments for its release. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) quickly identified the software responsible as originating from DarkSide, a notorious cybercrime group.

In the wake of the attack, Kevin Feeney, a spokesperson for Colonial Pipeline, emphasized the separation between their IT and operational technologies, stating, "Our operational decisions and rigorous cybersecurity policies emphasize the segmentation between IT and operational technology to prevent precisely these types of incidents."

Nonetheless, some social media users have sought to link the pipeline attack's technical breach to baseless claims of voting machine vulnerabilities in the 2020 election. These posts not only build on unfounded 2020 election fraud claims but also incorrectly suggest that if a pipeline can be hacked, so can an election.

Will Adler, a Senior Technologist for Elections and Democracy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, cautions against such comparisons. Adler notes, "The comparison between a ransomware attack on a pipeline and the security of U.S. voting systems is fundamentally misleading. Our voting systems are not only auditable but are rigorously tested and certified. They also benefit from the decentralized nature of U.S. elections, making widespread interference virtually impossible."

Investigations into the November 2020 election found no evidence of fraud or interference that would have affected the election's outcome. The security measures surrounding election systems, including paper ballot backups, post-election audits, and the fact that voting machines are not connected to the internet, protect against the sort of wide-scale tampering implied by claims connecting them to vulnerabilities exposed by the Colonial Pipeline hack.

Dominion Voting Systems, frequently targeted by unfounded allegations of election tampering, and other authorities have consistently refuted claims of hacking or interference in the 2020 election's infrastructure. The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency described the 2020 election as "the most secure in American history."

The suggestion that the vulnerability of one sector of critical infrastructure indicates similar weaknesses in the electoral system reveals a misunderstanding of both the specifics of ransomware attacks and the stringent security measures protecting U.S. elections. Experts across the cybersecurity field have repeatedly emphasized the robustness of election security protocols and the regular audit and testing processes that ensure election integrity.

Additionally, the decentralized nature of U.S. elections — with management at the local and state levels — further complicates any attempts at widespread interference. This system of electoral management ensures a level of complexity and variability that serves as a barrier against the type of uniform vulnerability exploit seen in corporate or infrastructure ransomware attacks.

In summary, while concerns over cybersecurity and the protection of critical infrastructure like the Colonial Pipeline are legitimate, misleading comparisons to the integrity and security of U.S. elections carry no weight. Ongoing efforts by cybersecurity professionals and election officials continue to fortify these systems against threats, underscoring the significance of distinguishing between different types of cyber threats and recognizing the specific measures in place to counteract them.
