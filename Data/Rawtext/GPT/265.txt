WHO Designates New Coronavirus Variant B.1.1.529 as Variant of Concern: Named Omicron

The World Health Organization (WHO) has, in response to the emergence of a new coronavirus variant, stepped forward with critical updates and advisories to the global community. In a significant development, following a convened meeting of the Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) on 26 November 2021, a concerning analysis of the B.1.1.529 variant was presented.

Reported initially by South Africa to the WHO on 24 November 2021, the B.1.1.529 variant's first known infection dates back to 9 November 2021. The rapid response and transparency demonstrated by South African health authorities in conjunction with the WHO's TAG-VE underscores a collaborative spirit in the global fight against the pandemic.

This variant, distinguished by a large number of mutations, has raised immediate concerns among the global health community. Preliminary evidence surrounding the B.1.1.529 variant suggests a notable escalation in the risk of reinfection when compared with other variants that have previously circulated.

Compounding the concern is the observed surge in cases across nearly all provinces in South Africa where the variant has been detected. This uptick in B.1.1.529 cases is an alarming development, warranting the undivided attention of the global health infrastructure.

In terms of diagnostics, the current suite of SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests retains the capacity to detect this variant. Notably, the S gene target failure observed in a specific PCR test has been identified as a potential marker for this variant, aiding in swift detection.

Upon careful consideration of the assembled evidence, the TAG-VE has rendered its advice that the B.1.1.529 should be classified as a Variant of Concern (VOC), thereby bestowing upon it the name 'Omicron'. This designation is significant, pinpointing the variant as one of particular public health importance.

Following through with global health protocols, the WHO has disseminated the decision to categorize Omicron as a VOC to member states and the wider international community, underscoring the ongoing commitment to keep all stakeholders informed about critical developments.

In light of this designation, the WHO urges countries worldwide to recalibrate their surveillance systems, enhance their sequencing efforts, and ensure timely reporting of VOC-associated cases. This directive aims to fortify global preparedness and response to the evolving pandemic landscape.

Moreover, the WHO calls on individuals in every nation to persist in adhering to proven public health measures. These include the wearing of masks, maintaining social distance, practicing hand hygiene, ensuring adequate ventilation in indoor settings, and avoiding crowded places. Additionally, vaccination against COVID-19 is underscored as a critical layer of protection, now more urgent than ever.

In reaffirming the definitions of a Variant of Interest (VOI) and Variant of Concern (VOC), the WHO emphasizes the structured approach to monitoring and responding to mutations of the virus. A VOI is recognized by its genetic properties potentially implicating a future risk, requiring a specific epidemiological monitoring. Conversely, a VOC, such as Omicron, is identified by its demonstrated or potential impact on public health, including factors such as transmissibility, disease severity, and the effectiveness of public health and social measures, diagnostics, therapeutics, or vaccines.

As the situation with Omicron evolves, the WHO remains steadfast in its commitment to providing timely, evidence-based updates. The shared goal continues to be the mitigation of the virus's impact globally through coordinated action and adherence to public health guidelines.

In conclusion, the emergence of the Omicron variant has ushered in a renewed sense of urgency within the global health community. Through enhanced surveillance, dedicated research, and collective adherence to public health measures and vaccination, the world can navigate the challenges posed by this new VOC. The WHO, alongside its member states and partners, will continue to lead in the endeavor to safeguard public health and advance towards the resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.
