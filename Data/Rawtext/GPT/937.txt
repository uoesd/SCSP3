Fact Check: Misconceptions About The Consequences of Trump's Second Impeachment Circulate Online

Washington – A viral tweet claiming that a second impeachment of former President Trump would prevent him from running in the 2024 election and strip him of several post-presidency benefits has been widely circulated but is largely inaccurate. A thorough examination of the claims reveals several misunderstandings about the legal implications of impeachment without removal and the repercussions on the president's future benefits and eligibility to run for office.

The tweet suggests that impeachment alone would result in Trump losing his pension, travel allowance, secret service detail, and the ability to run for office again in 2024. These claims, however, do not hold up under scrutiny. Impeachment in itself, without a subsequent removal from office by the Senate, does not affect a president's entitlement to post-presidency benefits or his eligibility to seek office again.

The Former Presidents Act specifies that a president's pension, which amounts to a little over $200,000 per year, is only revoked if they are impeached and then removed from office by the Senate. Therefore, without a conviction by the Senate, the president maintains the right to his pension.

Contrary to the viral tweet's suggestion, presidents do not receive a $1 million travel allowance. This misunderstanding likely stems from a confusion regarding the benefits that are actually provided to former presidents. The General Services Administration handles these benefits, which include funding for office space, staff, and travel for official business, but do not amount to a fixed $1 million travel allowance.

The issue of whether a president removed from office would lose lifetime Secret Service protection is more complex due to conflicting legislation. However, impeachment without removal does not trigger any change in Secret Service detail.

"If Trump were to be impeached and removed, it's not clear cut whether he would lose Secret Service protection. There are arguments on both sides due to the way the laws intersect," noted Ross Garber, an impeachment and political investigations lawyer and Professor at Tulane Law School.

Moreover, disqualifying Trump from holding future office would require the Senate to vote separately on this matter after a conviction on impeachment charges. Impeachment alone is not sufficient to disqualify him from future elections.

"The Senate would need to conduct an additional vote on disqualification from future office if they sought to prevent Trump from running again. The first step, though, is conviction," added Stephen Vladeck, a law professor.

There is also a debate among legal experts regarding whether the presidency is considered an 'Office of honor, Trust or Profit' under the United States, from which one can be disqualified from holding upon impeachment and conviction. "The Constitution isn't crystal clear on this point, and scholars have differed on whether the presidency falls under this clause," said Josh Blackman, a law professor.

Furthermore, the mentioned travel allowance is provided to former presidents who do not receive lifetime Secret Service protection. Since Trump is entitled to Secret Service protection for life, this stipulation does not apply to him.

The individual who initially posted the viral tweet later admitted that the information might have been inaccurate and expressed surprise over the tweet's widespread attention and success.

In sum, the claims made in the viral tweet about the immediate consequences of a second impeachment of Trump are largely incorrect. Impeachment without removal from office does not directly affect a president's pension, eliminate a supposed $1 million travel allowance, nor does it strip away lifetime Secret Service protection. Furthermore, impeachment alone does not prevent a president from running in future elections. The dissemination of inaccurate information regarding such a crucial political process underscores the importance of fact-checking and verifying claims before sharing them widely.
