Afghanistan Unrest: A Month of Turmoil and Transition

Sept 15 (Reuters) – Kabul witnessed a dramatic change in power as Taliban fighters captured the city on August 15, concluding a swift offensive across Afghanistan that caught global observers by surprise. The ensuing days brought chaos, with both Afghans and foreigners scrambling to leave, leading to several tragic deaths amid the pandemonium. The rapid developments cast a global spotlight on Afghanistan, prompting reactions from international leaders and organizations.

In the immediate aftermath of Kabul's fall, President Joe Biden faced intense scrutiny over the U.S. military's withdrawal strategy. Addressing the nation on August 17, Biden stated that the turmoil was anticipated but asserted that ending the twenty-year U.S. military presence was the right decision, despite the chaotic evacuation scenes at Kabul airport and widespread concern for the Afghans left behind.

Amid criticisms and fears of a return to the harsh regime of the 1990s, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid sought to present a more moderate face to the world. In a press conference, Mujahid promised, "We are going to allow women to work and study within our frameworks. Women are going to be very active within our society." However, skepticism remains high among the international community regarding the Taliban's promises.

Throughout August, anti-Taliban protests emerged in various parts of Afghanistan, challenging the group's rule. These demonstrations were occasionally met with violence, highlighting the volatile security situation. A horrifying manifestation of the unstable security environment was a suicide bomb attack near Kabul's airport, resulting in numerous casualties and underscoring the threats that still exist from other extremist groups like ISIS-K.

In response to the escalating humanitarian crisis and the chaos that followed their takeover, the Taliban announced measures to investigate reports of atrocities committed by their fighters. The group also addressed the economic turbulence, pledging efforts to stabilize the nation's financial and food supply systems, although specifics on these promises were sparse.

The U.S. military, during this turbulent period, executed drone strikes against Islamic State threats near Kabul airport, aiming to protect the evacuation operations that were in a frantic race against the clock. U.S. General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, stated, "These strikes demonstrate our resolve to defend our people and to maintain the momentum of the evacuation."

On August 30, in a significant milestone, General McKenzie announced, "I'm here to announce the completion of our withdrawal from Afghanistan and the end of the military mission to evacuate American citizens." This marked the end of two decades of U.S. military presence in Afghanistan.

In the weeks that followed, the Taliban announced a new interim government on September 7 and slowly started the process of reopening Kabul airport for aid and domestic flights, an essential step toward addressing the urgent needs of the Afghan population. Amidst the ongoing crisis, international donors stepped up, pledging $1.1 billion in aid to Afghanistan, signaling the world's commitment to prevent a humanitarian disaster but leaving many questions unanswered about the country's future under Taliban rule.
