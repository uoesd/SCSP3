Reading Schools Reopen After Arrest of Student Over Shooting Threat

READING, Ohio (WXIX) – Reading schools will reopen on Friday following a closure caused by a potential threat of violence that led to the arrest of a 13-year-old student. The student was charged with inducing panic after allegedly threatening a school shooting, officials said.

The alarming situation came to light when a Snapchat message circulated, warning students not to come to school. Following the discovery of the message, the Reading Police acted swiftly to assess the threat's credibility.

"After a thorough investigation, we believed the threat to be credible and proceeded with an arrest," said authorities in a statement. The student involved was taken into custody and is the subject of an ongoing investigation by both the police and the school district.

Jason Enix, the District Superintendent, emphasized the seriousness with which the district treats such threats. "We are working closely with Reading Police to investigate the threat. Our primary concern is always the safety and wellbeing of our students and staff," Enix stated.

The student was arraigned at the Hamilton County Juvenile Court Youth Center, where Judge Melissa Powers highlighted the gravity of the situation. "Given the nature of the threats and the current climate regarding school safety, we believe it is in the best interest of all parties involved to detain the student until the next court date," Judge Powers remarked.

Initial reports indicate that the student is a member of the National Honor Society, which adds a layer of complexity to the case. "This situation is particularly distressing given the student's academic standing. However, the safety of our school community must come first," added Superintendent Enix.

The prosecution insists on holding the student with no bond until further hearings, underscoring the serious nature of the threat and its impact on the community.

Superintendent Enix also reached out to parents, alerting them to the situation and calling for increased vigilance. "We must all do our part to ensure a safe learning environment. Please, continue to communicate with your children and monitor their social media usage," he advised.

Classes are scheduled to resume on Friday, with an increased police presence around the campus to ensure the safety and security of students and staff.

The incident at Reading schools is part of a wider pattern of threats against Tri-State school districts, raising concerns about the safety of educational institutions and the mental health and well-being of students.

Authorities and school officials are urging parents and students to remain alert and report any suspicious activity or threats to the appropriate channels, as the community works together to maintain a safe and secure learning environment.
