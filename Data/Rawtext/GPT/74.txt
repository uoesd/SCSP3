Joint Chiefs of Staff Reaffirm Commitment to Constitution and Peaceful Power Transition

In a momentous message issued on January 12, 2021, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have spoken directly to U.S. troops, reiterating their unfaltering commitment to the U.S. Constitution and the essential principle of a peaceful transfer of presidential power. This communication serves as a bedrock affirmation of the military's dedication to lawful civilian authority and the protection of American lives and property through support of civil authorities.

The memo sharply delineated the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol as a 'direct assault' on the legislative heart of our democracy, strongly condemning the violent acts that disrupted the Constitutional process of confirming the presidential election results. The Joint Chiefs described these events as contrary to the rule of law and the democratic ideals that the United States military is sworn to protect.

Within this solemn reflection, the Joint Chiefs also mourned the loss of two Capitol policemen alongside others who were fatalities of the January 6 incidents. Their message strongly condemned the violence and breaches of law and order that occurred during the riot, reiterating that while freedom of speech and assembly are cornerstones of U.S. freedoms, they do not justify violence, sedition, or insurrection.

Furthermore, the message to service members underscored the importance of embodying the nation's values and upholding their pledge to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. It solidified the inauguration of President-elect Biden on January 20, 2021, marking the continuation of the country's democratic legacy with Biden set to become the 46th Commander in Chief.

The Joint Chiefs called on troops, both deployed and at home, to maintain readiness, focus, and honor their duty to safeguard American democratic principles. This message encapsulates a stern reminder of the military's fundamental role in upholding democracy and the rule of law, especially during critical periods of national transition and crisis. Through their unwavering dedication, the Joint Chiefs of Staff lead by example in reinforcing the pillars of American democracy at a pivotal moment in the nation's history.
