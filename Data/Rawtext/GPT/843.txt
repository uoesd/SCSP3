Tiger Woods Hospitalized Following Serious Car Crash in LA

LOS ANGELES (AP) – Tiger Woods, the celebrated professional golfer, was seriously injured in a single-car accident early Tuesday morning in the suburbs of Los Angeles, marking a significant moment in a career that has been both luminous and tumultuous. Woods had to be extricated from his badly damaged SUV following the crash and was undergoing surgery for multiple leg injuries, according to his manager.

"Mr. Woods suffered multiple leg injuries. He is currently in surgery and we thank you for your privacy and support," said Mark Steinberg, Woods' long-time manager, in a statement shortly after the accident occurred.

The crash happened on a sweeping, downhill stretch of road known for its high rate of accidents. Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Christopher Thomas provided details on the incident, saying, "The vehicle rolled several times before coming to a halt. Mr. Woods was conscious and able to communicate when responders got to the scene. He was transported to the hospital in serious condition."

Authorities reported that the accident, which involved only Woods' vehicle, did not immediately point to a clear cause. Following the crash, a second minor collision occurred when a vehicle that had stopped to help was hit. This secondary accident did not result in any injuries.

At the time of the accident, Woods was in Los Angeles for the Genesis Invitational, which benefits his foundation, and for a two-day content shoot with GOLFTV where he was giving on-course lessons to celebrities. The accident follows an already challenging period for Woods, who has faced a myriad of physical setbacks over the years, including numerous surgeries.

This incident marks the third time Woods has been involved in a car-related investigation, adding another chapter to his complex public narrative that spans triumph, setback, and recovery.

The sports world, alongside fans and celebrities, has rallied with concern and support for Woods, wishing him a speedy recovery. His accident has prompted a widespread outpouring of hopes for his well-being, underscoring Woods' enduring impact on both golf and the broader landscape of athletic excellence.
