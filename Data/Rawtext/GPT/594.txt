Vice President Kamala Harris Advocates for Gender Equality and Democracy

In a powerful address to the Commission on the Status of Women, Vice President Kamala Harris underscored the pivotal role that the commission has played since its inception in 1947. She began her speech by recognizing the historical significance and enduring impact of the commission's work in advocating for women's rights and gender equality on a global stage.

Harris passionately spoke about the intrinsic connection between democracy and gender equality, emphasizing the fundamental democratic principle that every citizen should have an equal voice. According to her, the strength of a democracy can be measured by how it treats its women and ensures they have equal opportunities to participate in every aspect of society.

However, the Vice President expressed concern over a troubling trend observed over the past fifteen years—a consistent decline in global freedom. She highlighted that the previous year marked an alarming low point for democracy and freedom worldwide, pointing to increasing authoritarianism and suppression of rights in various countries.

Amidst the current global health and economic crises, Harris stressed the critical importance of defending democracy. She argued that the challenges posed by the pandemic and economic instability necessitate a robust response from democratic institutions to protect the rights and freedoms of all citizens, particularly women who are disproportionately affected.

In a commitment to global cooperation and advocacy for human rights, Harris announced that the United States is ramping up its engagement with the United Nations and rejoining the Human Rights Council. This move signals a renewed dedication to international diplomacy and support for global efforts to promote human rights and equality.

The Vice President elaborated on the fundamental relationship between the status of democracy and the empowerment of women. She pointed out that democracies are strengthened when women are empowered to participate fully in public and political life, contributing diverse perspectives and fostering more inclusive governance.

Highlighting progress within the United States, Harris celebrated the increased participation of women in elections, their growing representation in Congress, and their ascent to leadership roles across sectors. She saw these achievements as indicative of the strides being made toward gender equality and democratic participation.

Nevertheless, Harris acknowledged the significant threats posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to women's economic security, physical safety, and health. She laid out how the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities and vulnerabilities for women worldwide, necessitating urgent action to address these challenges.

In response to the pandemic and its impact on women, the Vice President announced that the United States has re-engaged with the World Health Organization and is revitalizing partnerships to empower women globally. These efforts are aimed at ensuring women's access to health care, economic opportunities, and protection from violence and exploitation.

In her concluding remarks, Harris committed to upholding democratic values and working tirelessly to improve the status of women both domestically and internationally. She invoked the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, highlighting the deep connection between democracy and the equality of all people, regardless of gender. Her speech served as a call to action, urging global leaders and citizens alike to join in the fight for democracy and gender equality.
