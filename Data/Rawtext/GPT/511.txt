Missouri National Guard Deployed to Aid Hurricane Ida Recovery in Louisiana

In a significant show of interstate solidarity and assistance, Governor Mike Parson has announced the deployment of approximately 300 Missouri National Guard soldiers to Louisiana. This mobilization comes in response to the catastrophic damage caused by Hurricane Ida, with the Missouri troops set to provide crucial support to the recovery efforts already underway.

According to Governor Parson, the decision to assist Louisiana stems from a deep-rooted belief in the importance of states supporting each other during times of crisis. "When our friends in Louisiana called for help, Missouri did not hesitate to answer the call. The Missouri National Guard is well-trained in recovery operations, and their skills will be invaluable in the efforts to rebuild and restore the affected communities," Governor Parson stated, reinforcing the spirit of cooperation that defines our nation's response to natural disasters.

The Missouri National Guard's assignment will focus on humanitarian support, debris removal, and providing general aid to the stricken areas. The troops being deployed are primarily from the 110th Maneur Enhancement Brigade and the 35th Engineer Brigade, units with substantial experience in handling the aftermath of such devastating events.

Maj. Gen. Levon Cumpton, the Adjutant General of the Missouri National Guard, expressed confidence in the Guard's capability to make a significant difference in Louisiana's recovery process. "Our soldiers are highly trained and ready to assist in whatever capacity they are needed. Their experience in emergency response and recovery operations makes them an asset in these efforts," Cumpton explained.

This deployment, scheduled to last up to 14 days but extendable should the need arise, comes through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), a mutual aid agreement among states that facilitates the sharing of resources and support in times of emergency. It underscores the broader ethos of Americans helping Americans, a foundational principle that guides the nation's response to any crisis.
