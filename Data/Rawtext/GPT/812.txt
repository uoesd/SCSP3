$15 Billion in Child Tax Credit Payments Set to Support American Families in August

BALTIMORE (WBFF/WKRC) – In a significant boost to American families, the federal government is set to distribute about $15 billion in Child Tax Credit payments this August, impacting approximately 61 million children across the nation. This substantial financial relief is part of the ongoing efforts under the American Rescue Plan initiated in March to support families affected by the economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The upcoming disbursement, scheduled for direct deposit on August 15, with checks mailed out a few days later, represents the continuation of a series of financial aids aimed at bolstering family incomes during these challenging times. This initiative is not only a direct effort to alleviate financial pressure but is also a strategic move to stimulate economic recovery.

By September 15, families will have received the third in a series of six planned monthly payments for this year, offering a financial lifeline to those in need. In a thoughtful distribution approach, the first half of the Child Tax Credit is being provided through these monthly checks, with the remainder of the amount to be received next year during tax filing season in 2022.

Eligibility for receiving these payments requires families to have at least one child under the age of 18, with payment amounts set at $300 per child under 6 and $250 per child aged between 6 and 17. Such financial support is indeed a welcome relief for eligible families navigating through the economic implications of the pandemic.

However, there are income thresholds in place, where the eligibility for the full Child Tax Credit begins to phase out. Specifically, this phaseout starts for incomes exceeding $150,000 for joint filers, $112,500 for heads of households, and $75,000 for single filers, with the Child Tax Credit reduced by $50 for each $1,000 above these income thresholds.

In July, an administrative hiccup saw 15% of recipients experience issues with their direct deposits. However, officials have reassured that these issues are anticipated to be resolved in time for this month's scheduled payment, ensuring smoother transactions and financial aid delivery.

At the year's end, the IRS plans to send a letter to all families who received these support checks. This letter is necessary for the beneficiaries as it will be required for their tax filing in 2022, ensuring transparency and accuracy in the accounting of this financial assistance.

As American families continue to navigate through the economic challenges posed by the pandemic, these Child Tax Credit payments are a beacon of support, aiding in the recovery and stability of households across the nation.
