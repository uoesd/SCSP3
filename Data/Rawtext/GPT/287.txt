AMA Urges Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccinations for Health Care Workers to Safekeep Patient and Colleague Safety

The American Medical Association (AMA), the nation's premier health organization, is intensifying its call for mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations among health care and long-term care workers. With the relentless surge in cases, largely driven by contagious variants and disproportionately affecting the unvaccinated, the need for universal vaccination within health sectors has never been more critical.

Susan R. Bailey, M.D., Immediate Past President of the AMA, highlighted the imperative, stating, "The safety of our patients and their care providers is our utmost priority. With over 300 million doses administered in the US and close to 4 billion worldwide, the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines are not just hopeful; they are evidential. We owe it to those we care for and those we work with to accept our responsibility to get vaccinated."

The plea for mandate comes amidst an alarming backdrop: despite vaccines' proven effectiveness, a significant number of health care and long-term care workers remain unvaccinated. This reality poses a severe risk not only to their health but more so to the vulnerable populations they serve. It's against this backdrop that health care organizations nationwide are advocating for mandatory vaccinations to safeguard the collective wellbeing.

Support for such measures is gathering momentum among experts and influential institutions, underscoring a collective recognition of the vaccines' role in curtailing the pandemic's impact. "Mandatory vaccination is not a novel concept in health care, but it's a necessary step forward in our fight against COVID-19," Dr. Bailey added.

Moreover, while the AMA acknowledges that a small subset of workers may be exempt from vaccination due to valid medical reasons, it emphasizes that these cases are exceptional. The broader message is clear: the path to overcoming the pandemic hinges on widespread vaccination.

Acknowledging the historical mistrust towards health care institutions in certain communities, the AMA stresses the importance of effective communication and community engagement to address these valid concerns. "We must learn from the past and ensure transparency, trust, and inclusivity as we navigate these challenges," Dr. Bailey noted.

The AMA's call to action doesn't merely serve as guidance for health care and long-term care employers but also as a model for all employers across various sectors. "By leading through example, the health care community can pave the way for broader societal embrace of vaccine mandates," Dr. Bailey concluded, underscoring the critical role of leadership in public health advocacy.

As the pandemic evolves, so too does the AMA's commitment to public health and safety. Through unified efforts and mutual cooperation, the goal of ending the pandemic becomes an attainable reality.
