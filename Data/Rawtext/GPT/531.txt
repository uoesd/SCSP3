Hurricane Ida Could Cost Insurers $30 Billion in Losses

Sept 3 (Reuters) – In the tumultuous aftermath of Hurricane Ida, insurers might bear a $1 billion hit solely from the physical damage to offshore rigs, sources have revealed. This first estimate, still in the early stages, excludes the vast economic losses from production disruptions, hinting at a potential revision as more data becomes available. The hurricane's path through Louisiana not only halted refinery operations but also caused significant disruptions in the U.S. crude supply chain, putting further pressure on insurers to assess and respond to widespread damage.

Utility disruptions wrought by the storm could add to insurers' headaches, potentially leading to prolonged periods of claims reporting and payouts. This extended timeline only compounds the challenges faced by the industry as they begin to tackle the immediate impacts of the storm. Analyst firm Karen Clark & Co has pegged the initial loss estimates across the US and the Caribbean at $18 billion, highlighting the extensive reach of Ida's destruction.

CoreLogic, another analytical firm, has provided a more detailed breakdown, estimating insured flood losses in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to be between $6 and $9 billion. In addition, wind losses are expected to range from $8 to $12 billion across these states. Analysts warn that total losses could surge towards the $30 billion mark, especially after the devastating flash flooding that claimed at least 44 lives across four Northeastern states.

Significant water damage is anticipated in the Northeast, with most claims expected to be filed in the coming days. "We're bracing for a significant number of claims following the widespread damage caused by Hurricane Ida," said William Liebler, U.S. Chief Claims Officer at Marsh. His remark underscores the widespread concern within the insurance industry about the magnitude of the event and its repercussions.

AIR Worldwide, a risk modeling firm, estimates that insured losses from Hurricane Ida could range from $17 billion to $25 billion. This figure, however substantial, underlines the critical nature of the hurricane's impact on both the insurance industry and the broader economic fabric of the affected regions. As insurers and analysts continue to refine their assessments, the financial fallout from Hurricane Ida will undoubtedly shape the industry's approach to future natural disasters.
