'Rust' Executive Producers Distance Themselves from Tragic On-Set Shooting

In the wake of the tragic shooting on the 'Rust' movie set that claimed the life of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza, executive producers of the film are stepping forward to clarify their roles, asserting that their involvement was strictly financial and did not extend to the daily operations of the production. Allen Cheney, alongside Emily Salveson and her Streamline Global finance company, has emphasized their detachment from the decision-making processes that have since come under intense scrutiny.

Speaking on behalf of the production, Cheney stated, "Our role in this project was purely financial. We provided the funding necessary for 'Rust' to move forward but were not involved in the day-to-day management or decision-making of the film. Any assumptions otherwise are misguided."

The tragedy has sparked a wider conversation about safety protocols and cost-cutting measures on film sets. 'Rust' has been criticized for allegedly hiring non-union crew members and other decisions indicative of an attempt to reduce expenses in ways that could compromise safety. Additionally, Bondit Media Capital, another entity named in connection with the financing of 'Rust,' clarified that their involvement was limited to loaning money against distribution collateral, without taking an equity stake in the production.

Furthermore, the revelations that the film was not bonded, a standard practice designed to ensure financial security and the smooth completion of a project, points to significant financial and management oversights.

District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies made it clear that actor Alec Baldwin remains a person of interest in the ongoing investigation, saying, "The investigation is far from over, and all aspects of the production, including Mr. Baldwin's role, are still being thoroughly examined."

Financial details revealed that the financing of 'Rust' involved the sale of North American distribution rights and foreign presales, which totaled around $3 million. Salveson and Ryan Donnell Smith, both known for utilizing tax incentives to finance film projects, bring significant industry experience to the table, yet they stress their non-involvement in the operational aspects of 'Rust.'

Ownership of 'Rust Movie Productions LLC' includes Cheney and Donnell Smith, with operational connections to Thomasville Pictures, further complicating the web of financial and managerial responsibilities surrounding the ill-fated production. As the investigation continues, the film industry watches closely, hoping for change that ensures such a tragedy never occurs again.
