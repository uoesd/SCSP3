US Military Chiefs Condemn Capitol Insurrection in Unprecedented Statement

In a striking move underscoring the gravity of the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the United States Capitol, the nation's top military officers have issued a rare public statement condemning the attack. This collective message was sent to all US military members and was signed by all eight members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, marking a significant moment in the nation's history where military leadership felt compelled to publicly address the political unrest.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Army Gen. Mark Milley, chair of the group, described the riot as a direct assault on Congress, the Capitol building, and the Constitutional process — a clear and outright denunciation of the violent events. They emphasized that the rights of freedom of speech and assembly, while cornerstones of American democracy, do not grant anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition, and insurrection.

In their message, the military leaders issued a stark warning to service members, cautioning them against any actions that might impede President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. They stressed that any attempt to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against the law but a betrayal of the oath taken by every member of the US armed forces.

This unprecedented call to action by the military's highest-ranking officers comes in the wake of allegations that some veterans and possibly some active-duty troops were involved in the Capitol siege. The involvement of individuals with military training and backgrounds heightens concerns about domestic extremism and the potential for insider threats to national security.

The Pentagon's leadership aims to uphold the long-cherished principle of the apolitical nature of the US military. Addressing such a politically charged event directly is rare for the Joint Chiefs, who typically limit their public comments to matters directly impacting the defense and security of the United States. This move underscores the seriousness with which they view the breach of the Capitol and its attack on democratic institutions.

Historically, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have reserved their collective voice for issues of remarkable significance, making this condemnation all the more momentous. It reflects the high level of concern among the highest ranks of the military about the potential for further violence and the undermining of the country's democratic principles.

In their statement, the military chiefs reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to defending the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. They pledged to support and defend the lawful transition of power to President-elect Joe Biden, who will be inaugurated as the 46th Commander in Chief of the United States. This reaffirmation serves not just as a reminder of the military's loyalty to the nation and its Constitution but also as a powerful message of unity and determination in the face of unprecedented challenges.

The issuing of this statement marks a pivotal moment in the relationship between the military and the American people. It reassures the public of the armed forces' dedication to democracy and the peaceful transfer of power, pillars upon which the country was founded. As the nation moves forward, the military chiefs' clear and unified stance against the Capitol insurrection will undoubtedly play a crucial role in restoring trust and ensuring the security of the United States during the presidential transition and beyond.
