Egypt Eyes Over $1 Billion in Compensation After Suez Canal Ordeal

CAIRO – In the wake of the successful refloating of the Ever Given, a massive container ship that choked the Suez Canal for nearly a week, Egyptian authorities are considering seeking over $1 billion in compensation. The chairman of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), Osama Rabie, disclosed that the hefty compensation figure is rooted in the losses of canal revenue, as well as the costs related to the equipment and manpower deployed during the six-day effort to dislodge the 200,000-ton vessel. The incident not only disrupted international shipping but also spotlighted the vulnerabilities of one of the world's most crucial maritime chokepoints.

"The Suez Canal's revenue is vital not just for Egypt but globally, and our efforts to free the Ever Given were in the interest of ensuring the smooth functioning of international trade. This compensation is merely a reflection of those underlying values and the tangible losses we incurred," said Rabie. He expressed hope for a forthcoming compensation agreement but stopped short of specifying which parties might be held financially responsible.

The blockage of the canal by the Ever Given had profound implications, holding up an estimated $9 billion in global trade per day according to some estimates. The tailback reached 422 vessels, prompting concerns over the prolonged impact on global supply chains already strained by the COVID-19 pandemic. First-hand accounts from the rescue operation underscored the enormous challenges faced by those on the front lines.

Aly Awamy, a mechanic aboard the Mashhour dredger, one of the key pieces of equipment used to free the Ever Given, described the scene as tense and fraught with danger. "Every second was a battle against time, and the risks were monumental," Awamy recounted. Adding to these sentiments, Mohammed Sayed, the head dredger, emphasized the relentless nature of the operation: "It was a 24/7 operation under immense physical and psychological pressure. We knew the world's eyes were on us." Dredger Youssef Naghi expressed pride in the successful outcome despite the adversities: "The conditions were harsh, but seeing the ship finally move was a moment of triumph."

As the dust settles, an investigation into the precise cause of the Ever Given's grounding is underway. It aims to unravel the web of human and technical errors that led to the predicament. However, the complex ownership and management structure of the Ever Given, including its Japanese owner (Shoei Kisen) and German operator (Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement), complicates the quest for accountability.

The insurance industry, bracing for the financial reverberations of the incident, is staring at losses estimated by Brian Schneider, senior director at the insurance division of Fitch Ratings, to be in the "low hundreds of millions of dollars." This figure pales in comparison to the overall impact on international trade but highlights the significant financial stakes involved.

A spokesperson for Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement underscored ongoing discussions about compensation, though detailed specifics remain under wraps. "We are in continuous dialogue with the Suez Canal Authority and other parties involved to address the financial aspects of the incident. Our priority remains the safety and integrity of shipping operations and the global supply chain," the spokesperson said.

The Ever Given saga, while concluded with the ship's liberation, opens a new chapter of legal and financial deliberations as stakeholders across the globe seek to recoup losses and safeguard against future disruptions. With global trade already navigating turbulent waters, the incident in the Suez Canal serves as a stark reminder of the delicate balance upon which modern commerce rests.
