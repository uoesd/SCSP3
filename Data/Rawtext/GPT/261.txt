Pfizer and BioNTech Announce Positive Results for COVID-19 Vaccine in Children Aged 5 to 11

NEW YORK AND MAINZ, Germany – In a significant development in the fight against COVID-19, Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE today announced positive results from their ongoing Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the companies' COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 5 to 11 years. The comprehensive data demonstrate a favorable safety profile and robust antibody responses using a two-dose regimen of 10 micrograms (μg), one-third the dose used for individuals 12 and older.

Amidst the backdrop of the increasing prevalence of the Delta variant, which has seen rising pediatric cases of COVID-19, Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer, stated, "Since July, pediatric cases of COVID-19 have risen by about 240% in the U.S.—underscoring the public health need for vaccination. These trial results provide a strong foundation for seeking authorization of our vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old, and we plan to submit them to the FDA and other regulators with urgency."

The trial's promising results were echoed by Dr. Ugur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of BioNTech, who expressed satisfaction with the findings: "The initial results we have seen in the trials involving children 5 to 11 years old are encouraging and extend the consistency observed in our trials across all other age groups. Our efforts to secure global population health against COVID-19 continue."

Involving 2,268 participants within the specified age group, the trial utilized a carefully selected 10 μg dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, administered 21 days apart. The lower dose was chosen to optimize the balance between vaccine efficacy and safety in this younger population. Immune responses elicited by the vaccine were comparable to those recorded in individuals aged 16 to 25 who received the 30 μg dose, indicating strong protection against COVID-19.

In response to these findings, Pfizer and BioNTech are preparing to submit data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the coming weeks. Additionally, the companies plan to update their existing EU Conditional Marketing Authorization with these results and complete the data submission for potential full regulatory approval in this age group.

The study on children 5 to 11 years is part of a broader clinical trial by Pfizer and BioNTech that aims to evaluate the vaccine's performance across different age groups, specifically enrolling children from 6 months to 11 years. This incremental approach helps to ensure the vaccine's safety and efficacy across all younger populations.

To date, COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) has been approved for use in individuals 16 years of age and older by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for those 12 and up. This includes authorization for a third dose for certain immunocompromised individuals, highlighting the vaccine's adaptability and critical role in combating the pandemic.

As Pfizer and BioNTech progress with the submission of these results for regulatory scrutiny, both companies reaffirm their commitment to diligently sharing data from their ongoing Phase 3 trial. The objective remains not only to secure regulatory approvals for the use of their COVID-19 vaccine in younger pediatric populations but also to contribute meaningfully to global efforts in overcoming the pandemic.

By extending the protection offered by the COVID-19 vaccine to children, Pfizer and BioNTech are taking a crucial step forward in the quest to curb the spread of the virus and ensure the health and safety of all population segments. This endeavor aligns with the companies' vision of science and collaborations as vital tools in the fight against this unprecedented health challenge.
