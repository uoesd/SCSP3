New York CNN Business – In a television event that has captured the attention of audiences around the world, Oprah Winfrey's highly anticipated interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle aired in the United States on CBS, Sunday, March 7, from 8 to 10 p.m. ET, and followed in the United Kingdom on ITV, Monday, March 8, at 9 p.m. The interview, which was pre-taped, has been a subject of significant anticipation, with CBS teasing highlights in the days leading up to the broadcast.

Viewers eager to catch the interview have several options, including streaming on CBS.com. Moreover, for those looking for in-depth analysis, CNN has been at the forefront, providing comprehensive coverage of the event.

Oprah Winfrey's relationship with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex is both personal and professional. Having been a guest at their wedding, Oprah has maintained a close bond with the couple and has also collaborated with Prince Harry on a mental health documentary. This relationship set the stage for an incredibly personal and revealing conversation in the interview.

The production of the interview was managed by Oprah's own company, Harpo, which retained full control over its execution. This fact underscores the influence and independence Oprah brought to the conversation, ensuring that it was conducted on her terms.

Internationally, the broadcast rights were managed by the global distribution arm of ViacomCBS Global, making it a global event with a wide-reaching impact.

The decision by Harry and Meghan to partake in this interview and speak out comes after a period of relative silence on the many controversies that have surrounded the couple's relationship with the royal family. It represents a significant moment for the couple to share their side of the story in their own words.

According to the Duchess, the interview had been in the works for years, yet she shared that previously she was not authorized to engage in such a conversation without the presence of Buckingham Palace communications staff. This revelation speaks volumes about the constraints they felt as working members of the royal family.

The couple made headlines in January 2020 when they announced their decision to step back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family. In February 2021, they confirmed that they would not be returning as working members, a decision that has led to significant public discourse about their future roles and responsibilities.

The broadcasting rights for the interview were a subject of much competition, with CBS acquiring them for an estimated license fee between $7 million and $9 million, according to details reported by the Wall Street Journal. This investment reflects the high level of interest and expectation surrounding the interview.

Throughout the conversation, Oprah navigated a wide range of topics with Harry and Meghan, from their personal experiences within the royal household to the pressures of living under intense public scrutiny. The couple's openness in sharing their struggles and decisions marks a significant departure from the traditional reserve associated with members of the British royal family.

As the world continues to digest the revelations from this groundbreaking interview, the conversation around the role of the monarchy, media scrutiny, and personal freedom is sure to continue. CNN remains committed to providing ongoing analysis and coverage of the implications of Harry and Meghan's candid conversation with Oprah Winfrey.
