Southeast Drivers Scramble for Gas After Pipeline Cyberattack

CLEMMONS, N.C. (AP) – The aftermath of a cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, a critical fuel source for the East Coast, has prompted panic-buying across the Southeast, with drivers forming long lines at gas stations. The Colonial Pipeline, responsible for delivering 45% of the East Coast's fuel, was forced into a shutdown due to the cyberattack, raising fears of a potential fuel shortage.

Despite government officials and energy analysts emphasizing that there is no actual shortage of gasoline, but rather a temporary distribution issue caused by the pipeline's shutdown, panic has driven many to hoard fuel. Authorities are actively seeking alternative transportation routes for fuel to alleviate the distribution problem.

In North Carolina alone, 28% of gas stations reported running out of fuel. This figure was even more dramatic in areas like Raleigh-Durham, where 72% of stations were without fuel. North Carolina's Democratic Governor, Roy Cooper, declared a state of emergency to help ease the transport of fuel into the state. "We are working closely with federal and state officials to ensure a continuous fuel supply," Cooper stated.

Nationally, the average price for a gallon of gasoline has risen above $3 for the first time since 2016, spurred on by fears of a fuel shortage. Jeanette McGee, a spokeswoman for the AAA auto club, remarked, "This price increase, although temporary, is a significant burden on consumers, especially as we approach the Memorial Day weekend, a time when we predict over 37 million Americans will travel."

The AAA's predictions for the Memorial Day weekend underline the expected rise in fuel demand, which could exacerbate the current situation if not addressed swiftly. In response, the U.S. government is coordinating efforts to prevent widespread fuel shortages, including authorizing certain states to transport overweight loads of fuel.

Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, highlighted the administration's proactive stance, saying, "We are monitoring the situation closely and are prepared to take all necessary steps to mitigate the impact of the shutdown, including reviewing Jones Act waiver requests to ease fuel shortages."

Many residents have shared their frustrations and concerns as the fuel situation directly impacts their livelihoods. Jamar Gatison, a construction worker and Uber Eats driver, expressed his alarm at the escalating prices and scarcity of gas. "It's becoming a real challenge to fill up, which affects my ability to work and provide services," Gatison noted.

Landscaper Mair Martinez shared similar concerns, emphasizing that the fuel shortage threatens his ability to maintain his business operations. "Without gas, we can't move our equipment, which means we can't work. Every hour counts for us," Martinez said.

Johnathan King, an employee at a local towing company, highlighted the logistical nightmares caused by the gas scramble. "We're seeing a significant uptick in calls from drivers stranded after running out of gas. It's creating a chain reaction of issues."

The Department of Homeland Security has indicated its readiness to assist in alleviating the situation by reviewing requests for waivers under the Jones Act, which would allow for more flexible transportation of fuel between U.S. ports.

Amid the chaos, officials continue to urge the public not to panic-buy gasoline, emphasizing that hoarding behavior exacerbates the distribution challenges. "Panic buying does not solve the problem and, in fact, can lead to further fuel shortages," said one official.

As efforts continue to stabilize the fuel supply and distribution, the coming days will be critical in determining the impact on Memorial Day travel plans for millions of Americans, highlighting the far-reaching effects of cybersecurity on the nation's infrastructure and daily life.
