Hollywood Shaken: Lundgren Voices Concern Over 'Rust' Tragedy and Advocates for Gun Safety on Sets

In an industry still reeling from the tragic shooting on the set of 'Rust,' action star Dolph Lundgren has come forward to express his shock and call for heightened firearm safety measures in filmmaking. The incident, which saw Alec Baldwin accidentally discharge a live round, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza, has sparked a renewed debate on the protocols surrounding the use of firearms on movie sets.

Lundgren, best known for his roles in action-packed films where firearms are a staple, emphasized the importance of gun safety. "It's shocking that something like this could happen in today's day and age," said Lundgren. "Firearm safety on set is something I take very seriously, and it's hard to understand how these protocols were not followed."

The actor recalled a similar tragedy that shook Hollywood in 1993 during the filming of 'The Crow,' which led to the death of Brandon Lee due to a firearms mishap. "When Brandon Lee died, it was a wake-up call for all of us in the industry. It seems we might have forgotten the lessons learned back then," Lundgren lamented.

To ensure safety, Lundgren adopts a cautious approach to handling firearms on set. "I always make it a point to dry fire and double-check any weapon I'm handling. There's no such thing as being too careful," he stated. This practice highlights a disciplined adherence to safety protocols that Lundgren believes should be universal on movie sets.

For his recent directorial effort, 'Castle Falls,' Lundgren chose to avoid real firearms altogether, opting for Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) to portray gun scenes. "In light of recent events, I feel that using CGI for guns is a safer, more responsible choice. We can achieve realistic effects without the risks," Lundgren explained, highlighting a growing trend towards digital alternatives in action filmmaking.

The accident on the 'Rust' set has brought attention to the procedures for handling firearms in movie productions. Alec Baldwin, handling a Colt revolver provided by assistant director Dave Halls, inadvertently fired a live round during a scene. Baldwin has since vowed to fully cooperate with the police investigation. "My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna," Baldwin shared in a statement, expressing his condolences to Hutchins' family.

The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department, led by Sheriff Adan Mendoza, is currently conducting a criminal investigation into the incident. "We are working diligently to piece together how a live round ended up on the set," Sheriff Mendoza stated, underlining the complexity and gravity of the investigation.

Legal repercussions have swiftly followed, with script supervisor Mamie Mitchell and the set's gaffer Serge Svetnoy taking legal action against Baldwin and other crew members. "No one has given me answers. Someone is responsible for the safety on the set, and the safety was not provided," Svetnoy expressed in his plea for accountability.

Mitchell echoed this sentiment in her legal filing: "We were all left in the dark, not knowing how such a tragedy could occur. This has caused me immense emotional distress."

As the film industry grapples with the ramifications of the 'Rust' shooting, Lundgren's call for rigorous firearm safety protocols and consideration of digital effects in place of live firearms resonates as a pragmatic response to prevent future tragedies. Industry professionals and safety experts alike are now called upon to reevaluate and strengthen safety measures on set, ensuring such a heartbreaking incident never occurs again.
