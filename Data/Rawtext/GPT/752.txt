Understanding the Layers of Guns Safety on Hollywood Sets

In the wake of the tragic and rare fatal shooting incident on the 'Rust' movie set, where cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was injured, questions about the safety of firearms on film sets have surged to the forefront of public discourse. While the incident has sparked speculation and concern, it's crucial to understand the multiple steps and stringent safety measures in place to prevent such accidents. Joey Dillon, a union armorer specializing in Westerns, who is based in Los Angeles, offers an insider's perspective on how firearms are managed on set, aiming to debunk myths and explain the intricate safety protocols followed in the industry.

The use of firearms in movies, particularly those that recreate historical periods or action sequences, is common. Yet, most audience members may not realize that the firearms seen on screen are, more often than not, real. "Every real firearm on set undergoes extensive paperwork, permits, and continuous monitoring," explains Dillon. This thorough approach ensures that from the moment a weapon arrives on set to the moment it is stored away, its journey is documented and overseen by professionals dedicated to safety.

A fundamental aspect of using firearms on film sets involves understanding the difference between live rounds, blank rounds, and dummy rounds. Revolvers, a common firearm used in Westerns and action movies, operate in a way that allows blank rounds to provide the visual and auditory effects of firing without projecting an actual bullet. Blank rounds create a flash and bang, giving actors and viewers the illusion of a real shot without the lethal outcome. Meanwhile, dummy rounds, which look like real ammunition but are inert, are used for scenes where visible bullets are necessary but firing is not.

"Before any gun is handed to an actor, it undergoes a rigorous check for obstructions in the barrel and is labeled 'cold' if it's safe. This is part of a series of rehearsals where actors are trained to safely handle the weapon," Dillon elaborates. The safety protocol extends to protective gear for those in proximity to the firing action and the methodical verification of the type of rounds being used. Actors and crew members are drilled on these procedures to ensure everyone's safety.

A crucial point Dillon emphasizes is the robust system of accountability and safety roles present on set. From armors like himself to assistant directors, multiple crew members are tasked with ensuring firearms are handled correctly and safely. This multi-tiered approach contributes significantly to the rarity of incidents like the one on the 'Rust' set. "In my years of experience, the level of attention and care given to firearm safety on set is unparalleled in most other work environments," Dillon states.

Highlighting the industry's standard, live rounds are categorically prohibited on movie sets, barring exceptional scenarios primarily reserved for educational purposes or extreme realism under strictly controlled conditions. When live firing is absolutely necessary, it's done with a protocol as stringent as any military or law enforcement training exercise, ensuring the safety of all involved. "It's important for the public to know that declaring a gun 'hot' on set isn't taken lightly. It involves not only checking if the gun's chambers are empty but also making sure everyone on set is aware and no one is in the potential line of fire," Dillon adds.

The rarity of incidents like the 'Rust' shooting can't be overstated. Such tragic events are incredibly unusual, given the exhaustive safety protocols in place. However, they serve as somber reminders of the absolute necessity of adherence to safety practices without deviation. Beyond just the mechanics and legalities of gun handling on set, there is an embedded culture of safety that professionals like Dillon advocate for every day.

This tragedy has undoubtedly initiated conversations about how to further improve safety protocols on sets involving firearms. While the investigation into the 'Rust' incident continues, it's imperative to recognize the complex, well-established frameworks that have been long in place to prevent such accidents. According to Dillon, examining and reinforcing these safety measures is a communal responsibility.

"In moments like these, our commitment to safety is tested. It's crucial for us, as an industry, to come together, reassess, and strengthen our protocols to ensure that such a tragedy never repeats," Dillon concludes. The 'Rust' incident, while rare, underscores the need for constant vigilance, training, and education in handling firearms on set, ensuring that the magic of cinema never comes at the cost of safety.
