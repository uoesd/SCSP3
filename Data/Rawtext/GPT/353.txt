Russia Sees Social Media Boom Amid Facebook Outage, Bolsters Push for Digital Sovereignty

MOSCOW, Oct 5 – As Facebook grappled with a global outage, displacing 3.5 billion users from its platforms including WhatsApp and Instagram, Russian social networks reported a significant uptick in activity, underscoring the country's push towards fostering its own digital ecosystem. Officials are citing this incident as a further justification for Russia's ongoing efforts to develop sovereign internet platforms, a move they argue will shield the nation from dependencies on foreign digital infrastructure.

Maria Zakharova, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, remarked on the situation stating, "This outage highlights the absolute necessity for countries to possess their own, independent social networks and digital platforms. The incident underpins the risks of reliance on global tech monopolies, and for Russia, it emphasizes the urgency to accelerate our digital sovereignty."

Facebook pointed to a faulty configuration change as the cause of the unprecedented downtime that affected its suite of services. In Russia, the outage led to a significant increase in traffic on domestic social platforms. Vkontakte, the country's largest social network, witnessed an 18% surge in video views and a 21% rise in messaging activity. According to Marina Krasnova, Head of Vkontakte, "Our audience expanded by 19% in comparison to the day before the outage, demonstrating the robust demand for local platforms in times of global disruptions."

Similarly, Odnoklassniki, another popular Russian social network, reported heightened activity during the Facebook downtime, further emphasizing the shift towards localized digital interactions.

Earlier this year, Russia conducted comprehensive tests aimed at disconnecting from the global internet. This was a part of a larger strategy to ensure the country could operate its own web independently, mitigating risks stemming from potential foreign interference or outright disconnection from global internet infrastructure. These measures, controversial though they may be, are framed within the context of national security and digital autonomy, a narrative that the recent Facebook outage has seemingly reinforced.
