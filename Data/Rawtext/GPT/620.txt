Vice President Kamala Harris Hits Historic Low Approval Rating, New Poll Reveals

Vice President Kamala Harris's approval rating has plummeted to an all-time low for any modern vice president, marking a significant setback for the current administration. According to a recent USA Today/Suffolk University poll, only 28% of respondents express satisfaction with Harris's performance. This figure represents a historic nadir, underscoring the challenges facing Harris and President Joe Biden's presidency.

Furthermore, President Biden's approval rating is also experiencing a downturn, registering a new low at 38%. These developments come amidst growing concerns among the electorate over various national issues, including economic pressures and foreign policy challenges.

The poll reveals that a majority, 51% of respondents, disapprove of the job Harris is doing as vice president. Such disapproval is unparalleled early in a modern presidency, raising questions about the administration's future direction and strategies for recovery.

Previously, former Vice President Dick Cheney held the record for the lowest approval ratings among U.S. vice presidents. However, with Cheney's low at 30%, Harris's current standing places her slightly more unfavorably compared to Cheney at the same point in his tenure.

Harris's responsibilities have included addressing complex and controversial issues, notably the management of the migration surge of asylum seekers at the southern border. These assignments have been challenging and have likely contributed to her declining approval ratings among the electorate.

Internal concerns within Harris's team have also surfaced, particularly regarding the 2024 presidential election and potential competition from figures such as Pete Buttigieg. These developments have fueled speculation and concern about the vice president's political future and her role within the Democratic Party.

The USA Today/Suffolk University poll, conducted among 1,000 registered voters nationwide, offers a comprehensive snapshot of current political sentiments. With a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, the poll's findings underscore the urgency facing the Biden-Harris administration as they seek to address their declining popularity.
