Capitol Police Under Fire: Inspector General Report Highlights Flaws in Jan. 6 Riot Response

In an unprecedented siege on the United States Capitol, the Capitol Police were expected to defend democracy's bastion. The events of January 6, however, unfolded in what seemed like slow motion, with officers showing a level of restraint not anticipated by observers, especially when considering the aggressive policing tactics witnessed in previous protests. Despite the chaos, a new in-depth report by Capitol Police Inspector General Michael A. Bolton presents a critique not of the officers on the ground, who faced insurmountable odds, but of the higher echelons of the force, pointing to grave lapses in preparation and response.

Michael A. Bolton's findings lay bare a disturbing narrative: in the lead-up to January 6, the Capitol Police were forewarned of a significant threat yet failed to act decisively. "The department's senior leaders did neither adequately prepare nor respond accordingly, dismissing threat assessments and handcuffing their officers' ability to act by limiting access to riot-control measures," Bolton disclosed in his report. The Capitol Police's leadership, engulfed in a miasma of complacency, failed to grasp the severity of incoming intelligence reports from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, which pointed unambiguously to potential violence. Such warnings were either ignored or grossly underestimated.

Former Chief of Capitol Police Steven Sund, who resigned in the aftermath of the riot, has contended that the intelligence available did not predict the scale of the attack. "The intelligence did not foresee the scale of the attack, and we were provided assurances of additional support," Sund remarked. Contrary to his assertions, however, Bolton's extensive report underscores a set of warnings that were clear yet unheeded by the Capitol Police Command. This disconnect, according to Bolton, left officers ill-equipped and under-prepared for the violence that ensued.

Among the shocking revelations was the inadequacy of police equipment, a point Bolton underscored with examples such as riot shields that shattered upon initial impact due to being improperly stored in a trailer that allowed them to be exposed to the elements. Moreover, the report excoriated the leadership's decision to restrict the use of potent, less-lethal crowd control weapons, which could have potentially altered the day's outcomes. "There seemed to be a reluctance to prepare for the worst-case scenario," Bolton noted. "Equipment was outdated, and the lack of standards for such crucial gear was evident."

The inspector general's report does not merely outline failings; it calls for an overhaul of the Capitol Police department and its cultural underpinnings. The detailed critique and subsequent recommendations suggest an urgency for reforms, not just in terms of strategy and equipment, but also in reevaluating how intelligence is acted upon. Compounded by public and congressional scrutiny, the contrasting responses between the Capitol riot and Black Lives Matter protests further fuel debates on systemic biases within law enforcement.

As the dust settles and the Capitol Police navigate a path toward reform, Bolton's findings serve as a sobering reminder of January 6's failings. They underscore a pressing need for introspection and change within one of the nation's most pivotal law enforcement agencies, tasked with protecting the heart of American democracy.
