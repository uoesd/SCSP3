SEC Launches Investigation into Disclosures Around SolarWinds Cyber-Breach

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is actively investigating the fallout from the SolarWinds cyber-breach, focusing on whether companies failed to adequately disclose their involvement and the impact of the breach. Public issuers and investment firms have received investigative letters from the SEC, seeking voluntary information regarding the effects of the hack and any potential failures in disclosure.

This probe delves into not only the adequacy of disclosures but also examines whether there were lapses in internal controls within the affected companies, alongside concerns related to insider trading prior to the public's knowledge of the breach. Furthermore, the SEC is scrutinizing company policies dedicated to protecting sensitive customer information in light of the cyber-attack.

Despite the gravity and scale of the investigation, the SEC's press office has opted to remain silent, declining all requests for comments.

In response to the unfolding situation, a spokesperson for SolarWinds conveyed the company's proactive stance, stating, "Our foremost priority is to work closely with our customers to understand and mitigate any issues that have arisen as a result of the attack on our systems."

Under US securities law, companies are obligated to disclose information that could be deemed "material," which includes cyber-breaches that might significantly affect share prices. The breach involving SolarWinds, which came to light in December, fits this criterion. The intrusion allowed hackers to infiltrate the data systems of thousands of companies and government offices, thereby adversely impacting SolarWinds' share price.

The hacking incident, attributed by both the US and UK governments to Russia's SVR, saw a broad spectrum of victims, including pivotal US federal agencies and numerous private sector companies. This wide-reaching cyber espionage campaign has put the spotlight on the need for stringent cybersecurity measures and transparent disclosures regarding breaches.

Companies that have responded to the SEC's request for information by detailing their experiences and breaches may avoid enforcement actions. The SEC appears willing to offer leniency for historical disclosure and internal control failures, provided companies are forthcoming with the requested information.

The focus of the investigation into lapses in disclosures and internal controls underscores the SEC's rigorous approach to ensuring that public companies adhere to laws designed to protect investors and the integrity of the markets. This approach serves as a wake-up call to all publicly-traded companies, emphasizing the importance of transparent communication with investors, especially in the face of cyber threats and breaches.

The ongoing investigation into the SolarWinds breach by the SEC is a reminder of the complexities and challenges facing companies in an era where cyber threats loom large. It also highlights the pivotal role of regulatory bodies in maintaining the balance between national security interests and the operational imperatives of companies in the digital age.
