Fact Check: No Fourth Stimulus Check of $2,000 Coming by Memorial Day

In recent days, social media platforms have been buzzing with claims that Americans should expect a fourth stimulus payment of $2,000 per person by Memorial Day weekend. However, this claim bears no truth. An investigation reveals that Congress has not approved a fourth round of direct stimulus payments as part of COVID-19 relief measures, debunking the viral misinformation.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has authorized three rounds of stimulus payments to help Americans combat the financial strain caused by the crisis. These stimulus rounds have provided much-needed relief to eligible citizens across the United States.

The most recent, or third round of stimulus payments, includes up to $1,400 per person. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is still in the process of distributing these payments to eligible recipients. Despite this ongoing effort, rumors and misinformation regarding a fourth round of payments have circulated widely.

Adding to the confusion, some social media posts incorrectly state the amount that will be provided as part of the expanded child tax credit for 2021. The accurate figures for the child tax credit are $250 to $300 per child between July and December, contrary to the claimed $300 to $500.

It's noteworthy that more than 50 House members and 21 senators have voiced their support for recurring stimulus payments to aid recovery. However, despite this backing, no legislative action has been taken to initiate another round of payments.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki provided clarity on the matter, stating, "The discussion about whether to have a fourth round of stimulus payments is really a decision for Congress to make." This statement underscores the fact that the executive branch is open to further relief measures, but the ultimate decision lies with Congress.

To date, the third-round stimulus has resulted in the distribution of 164 million payments, totaling approximately $386 billion. This significant effort underscores the vast scale of financial assistance provided to Americans during the pandemic.

Despite the genuine need for continued support highlighted by many Americans and their representatives, the claim that a fourth stimulus payment of $2,000 will be issued by Memorial Day is unequivocally false. Congress has only authorized three rounds of stimulus payments, and any statement to the contrary is unfounded.

Misinformation such as the claim of a forthcoming fourth stimulus check can create false hope and confusion among the public. It's essential for individuals to rely on verified sources for information regarding federal relief measures and to remain skeptical of unverified claims circulating on social media.

In summary, Americans awaiting further financial aid in the form of a fourth stimulus check by Memorial Day will be disappointed. The claim circulating on social media is false, and any official updates regarding federal relief measures will come directly from authoritative sources, such as the IRS or Congressional communications. It's crucial to stay informed through credible channels to avoid the spread of misinformation.
