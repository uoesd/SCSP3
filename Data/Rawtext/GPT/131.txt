CNN's Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon to Co-host Unscripted Podcast 'The Handoff'

CNN primetime anchors Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon are teaming up off-screen to launch a new podcast titled "The Handoff." This endeavor marks an exciting venture for the duo, who are known for their dynamic and candid exchanges on air. "The Handoff" is set to be a weekly event, available exclusively through a subscription to the CNN channel on Apple Podcasts.

The concept for the podcast is inspired by the spontaneous 'handoff' conversations that take place between Cuomo's and Lemon's shows on CNN. These exchanges, often filled with genuine dialogue and insight, have caught the attention of viewers and will now form the backbone of "The Handoff."

Don Lemon expressed his enthusiasm for the project, stating, "This is for the audience that wants to see us as we really are. It's unscripted, honest, and for people not easily offended. We're going deeper on our own thoughts and ideas, beyond the constraints of our shows." This approach promises a raw and unfiltered look into the thoughts and opinions of two of CNN's most prominent figures.

Their on-air interactions, including the recent notable conversation regarding Rick Santorum's controversial comments, have previously captured headlines. The duo's discussions often journey into realms not typically explored in mainstream media, touching on real thoughts, questions, and disagreements that resonate with a wide audience.

"The Handoff" is the latest in a series of podcast ventures by CNN as the network looks to diversify its digital content and revenue streams. Alongside "The Handoff," listeners can look forward to other new offerings like "Behind the Desk: The Story of Late Night" and a podcast helmed by Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon have expressed their intention behind the podcast to not only entertain but to challenge their listeners. "We're using this platform to toughen up our audience. It's about honest, straightforward dialogue about the things that matter," Cuomo explained.

The curiosity and intrigue surrounding Cuomo and Lemon's off-camera conversations have been a significant driving force behind the creation of "The Handoff." "People are genuinely curious about our discussions. They want more than just the handoff on TV — they want to know what's really on our minds," Chris Cuomo noted, emphasizing the authenticity that will define their podcast.

"The Handoff" promises to be a distinct and unbridled space for Cuomo and Lemon to share their perspectives, unfettered by the time constraints and formalities of television news. As the media landscape continues to evolve, "The Handoff" represents CNN's foray into creating content that is both engaging and reflective of the complex world we navigate, all the while maintaining the integrity and approachability that Cuomo and Lemon are renowned for.

In an era where audiences crave authenticity and depth, "The Handoff" is poised to become a pivotal addition to the podcasting world, inviting listeners into the unscripted and uncompromising discussions that define one of television's most compelling partnerships.
