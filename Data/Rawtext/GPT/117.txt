Texas ICU Nurse Warns of Potential Surge After State Lifts Mask Mandate

CNN – Brittany Smart, an ICU nurse from Texas, has voiced her deep concerns and exhaustion amidst the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. With more than a year spent in the front lines, fighting against the virus that has plagued the world, Smart now faces a new fear: the premature easing of restrictions in her state.

Governor Greg Abbott recently announced the lifting of the statewide mask mandate, in addition to removing capacity limits on businesses. This decision has left many health care workers, including Smart, worried about the potential consequences. "We're so close to the finish line with vaccines being rolled out, but this feels like we're throwing caution to the wind," she expressed.

The move by Governor Abbott comes at a time when vaccinations are on the rise and Covid-19 cases were previously showing a decline. However, the optimism among some has not permeated the healthcare sector, where workers see the mandate lift as premature. "We're all just incredibly tired... and now I fear that exhaustion will only get worse," Smart lamented.

Adding scientific backing to these concerns, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), noted the worrying trend on a national scale. "The latest decline in Covid-19 cases is leveling off at a very high number. This is not the time to relax critical safeguards that we know can stop the spread of Covid-19 in our communities," Dr. Walensky stated. The US has averaged over 65,000 new Covid-19 cases daily for the past week alone, indicating the ongoing threat of the virus.

On a local level, Texas reported more than 6,600 new Covid-19 cases and over 270 deaths in just a single day. Additionally, more than 5,600 Covid-19 patients are currently hospitalized across the state. Despite the noticeable reduction in hospital overcrowding from the pandemic's peak, the death toll continues to mount. "Patients are still dying from Covid-19. Every day we lose more lives," Smart remarked, highlighting the distressing reality in hospitals.

Experts have also warned of a potential surge in cases due to highly contagious variants of the virus now circulating within the US. This fact, combined with the easing of restrictions, paints a concerning picture for the near future.

Above all, Smart's biggest fear remains the loss of more lives. "I've seen too much suffering, too much pain. The lifting of these restrictions, in my eyes, only invites more tragedy. My biggest fear is losing more patients, more Texans," she somberly concluded.
