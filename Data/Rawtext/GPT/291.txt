Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna Set to Profit From COVID-19 Booster Market

NEW YORK, Aug 13 (Reuters) – As the world grapples with the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, pharmaceutical giants Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna are at the forefront of developing booster shots, an endeavor that could potentially earn them billions annually, reflecting the lucrative nature of the $6 billion flu vaccine market.

Governments in countries such as Chile, Germany, and Israel have already begun administering booster shots, indicating a proactive stance against the variant, despite ongoing debates regarding the necessity and timing of such measures. The trio of Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna have already secured orders amounting to over $60 billion in sales for 2021 and 2022, covering initial vaccine doses and potential booster shots.

Analysts anticipate a robust revenue stream for Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna from booster shots, forecasting over $6.6 billion and $7.6 billion in 2023 respectively. "The marketplace for COVID-19 vaccines, including boosters, is vast and varied," noted Stephen Hoge, President of Moderna, underlining the shifting demands shaped by emerging variants and the duration of vaccine-induced immunity.

Supporting evidence of decreasing antibody levels and breakthrough infections after initial vaccinations underscores the argument for booster shots. However, the extent of their necessity and the population segments they would most benefit remain subjects of debate. "It's not clear-cut who exactly needs the boosters the most," observed Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar. This uncertainty further blurs the estimation of how many people will need boosters and how swiftly competition might impact the booster shot market.

Pfizer expects a third dose of its vaccine to be necessary 6 to 8 months following full vaccination, with annual boosters potentially being required thereafter. This mirrors the approach of the seasonal flu shot market, which sees vaccination rates of about 50% in developed countries and robust competition keeping prices relatively in check.

Initially, Pfizer and Moderna might enjoy greater pricing power for their booster shots until more competitors enter the field. "The initial phase of booster roll-outs will likely see these companies having stronger pricing power," noted Steve Chesney, an analyst at Atlantic Equities. However, this might be moderated by the U.S. government's procurement of the shots, potentially curbing significant price hikes.

Efforts to evaluate mixing and matching different COVID-19 vaccines for booster shots are underway, which could introduce more dynamism into the booster market. "We're at the beginning of understanding how mix-and-match strategies might work, and that could open up the competitive landscape," said Vamil Divan, an analyst at Mizuho Securities.

Despite these opportunities, there are cautionary perspectives regarding the long-term economic sustainability for vaccine manufacturers. "The market could become more competitive and less predictable than we currently anticipate," remarked Bijan Salehizadeh, Managing Director at Navimed Capital, highlighting the potential for fluctuating demand and increasing market players.

Dave Ross, an executive at CSL's flu vaccine unit Seqirus, further pointed to underlying uncertainties in the booster market, suggesting that future developments and emerging data will greatly shape strategies and expectations. "Like the flu vaccine market, there are many unknowns about how the COVID-19 vaccine and booster market will evolve. But it's clear there will be a demand moving forward," he concluded.
