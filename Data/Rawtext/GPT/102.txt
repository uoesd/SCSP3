Texas Towns Under Spotlight for Aggressive Speed Traps

Two small towns in Texas have garnered attention for their aggressive use of speed traps, thrusting them into the limelight not for their charm or attractions, but for their hefty reliance on speeding tickets as a crucial source of revenue. A recent analysis by the Houston Chronicle has shed light on this practice, painting a comprehensive picture of traffic stop practices across more than 2,500 police departments in the state.

The Chronicle's examination, focusing on data from 2020, identified the top 21 towns in Texas where traffic stops were excessively high, measuring at over 500 stops per officer. Among these, four towns from Central Texas have notoriously made it into the top 11, with two securing the highest spots for their aggressive ticketing policies.

At the 11th position is the town of Bruceville-Eddy, where officers made 684 stops per officer, ultimately issuing 1,336 citations throughout 2020. Following closely is Buckholts, ranked 10th, with its officers conducting 741 stops each and handing out 1,341 citations. These figures reveal a pattern of heavy reliance on traffic fines as a significant source of municipal revenue.

Lott finds itself at an alarming second place with an astonishing 1,192 stops per officer, resulting in 2,475 citations issued in the same year. But the town of Rosebud takes the lead, topping the list with 1,385 stops per officer. Interestingly, despite the high number of stops in Rosebud, the number of citations issued stood at 1,001 in 2020, indicating a lower citation rate per stop compared to its peers.

This aggressive approach to traffic enforcement raises concerns about the role of speed traps in small-town revenue generation and the potential impact on drivers' perceptions of these communities. It also spotlights the utility of driving apps like Waze, which can alert motorists when they are over the speed limit, potentially helping them to avoid getting ticketed in these high-stop areas.

The issue of speed traps in Texas calls into question the balance between ensuring road safety and the perceived exploitation of drivers to bolster town coffers. With the spotlight now on these small towns, the debate on the ethical and financial implications of their traffic enforcement strategies is likely to intensify, paving the way for potential reforms in the future.
