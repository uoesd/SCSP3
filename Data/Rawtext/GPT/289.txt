WHO Adds Sinopharm COVID-19 Vaccine to Emergency Use Listing

In a significant move to bolster the global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has officially listed the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use. Produced by the Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, a subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG), the Sinopharm vaccine becomes the latest addition to the list of vaccines that have received WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL).

The EUL process is a rigorous one that aims to evaluate and expedite the availability of new or unlicensed health products during public health emergencies. It focuses on assessing the quality, safety, and efficacy of these products. For the Sinopharm vaccine, the evaluation included comprehensive data from phase III clinical trials and extensive on-site inspections of the production facility by WHO teams.

Dr. Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products, underscored the importance of this new listing, "This expands the list of vaccines that COVAX can buy, and gives countries confidence to expedite their own regulatory approval, and to import and administer a vaccine."

With the inclusion of Sinopharm in the EUL, WHO has urged the manufacturer to participate in the COVAX Facility - a global initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Participation by Sinopharm could significantly enhance the global supply of vaccines, ensuring more equitable distribution, particularly to low and middle-income countries.

The Sinopharm vaccine is approved for use in individuals 18 years and above, with a recommended two-dose schedule. Notably, WHO has not specified an upper age limit for its administration, highlighting its likely effectiveness in older age groups. However, the organization recommends close monitoring of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in older adults as it continues to be used globally.

This advisory comes as part of WHO's ongoing efforts to gather more data on different vaccines' performance across various population groups. "Monitoring safety and effectiveness in all age groups is critical to understanding the vaccine's impact and ensuring its best use worldwide," added Dr. Simão.

The decision to list the Sinopharm vaccine followed an extensive assessment process. Apart from reviewing efficacy and safety data, WHO's evaluation also focused on the vaccine's manufactural quality and the production facility's adherence to good practices.

The inclusion of the Sinopharm vaccine into WHO's EUL is a testament to the global health community's commitment to fight the pandemic through a collective and equitable approach. It acknowledges the critical need for a variety of vaccines to address different healthcare systems, populations, and infection transmission scenarios across the globe.

With this latest addition, the Sinopharm vaccine joins other products that have previously received WHO's emergency use approval, including vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), and Moderna. This growing portfolio of approved vaccines is key to navigating the pandemic, offering governments a wider array of tools to plan their vaccination campaigns effectively.

The Emergency Use Listing mechanism plays a crucial role in assuring that while the world rushes to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, it does not compromise on the safety and effectiveness standards established globally. By providing a controlled yet expedited pathway for vaccines and diagnostics to become available, WHO aids in ensuring that every country, regardless of its income level, has access to life-saving health products.

As the global community continues to fight against COVID-19, the addition of the Sinopharm vaccine to the WHO's emergency use list marks a hopeful step towards achieving widespread vaccination. It underscores the international effort required to combat the pandemic and highlights the importance of continued solidarity and cooperation among nations and pharmaceutical companies.

In urging Sinopharm to participate in the COVAX Facility, WHO is advocating for a more equitable approach to vaccine distribution, ensuring that no country is left behind in the global recovery from COVID-19. This move not only benefits countries struggling to obtain vaccines but also represents a stride towards global herd immunity, a critical factor in ending the pandemic.

The World Health Organization remains committed to monitoring the situation closely, ensuring that all approved vaccines meet the highest standards of safety and efficacy. As the world navigates through these challenging times, WHO continues to play a crucial role in coordinating global health responses, ensuring the equitable distribution of vaccines, and providing guidance to help end the pandemic.
