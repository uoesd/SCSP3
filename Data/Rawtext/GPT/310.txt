Ever Given Insurer Calls Suez Canal's $600 Million Claim 'Exceptionally Large'

CAIRO, May 10 (Reuters) – The insurance company representing the Ever Given has criticized the Suez Canal Authority's (SCA) revised compensation demand of $600 million as "exceptionally large." This reduction from an initial $916 million is part of efforts to reach an out-of-court settlement over the blockage that disrupted global maritime traffic for nearly a week in March.

The UK Club, which provides protection and indemnity insurance for the Ever Given, said the claim filed by the SCA still significantly overshoots reasonable compensation amounts. "Despite the SCA's recent reduction of their claim, we and the ship's owners still find the figure exceptionally large, with no detailed justification provided for this sum," a spokesperson for the UK Club stated.

The Ever Given, a colossal container ship, became lodged across the Suez Canal on March 23, halting maritime traffic in both directions and stranding ships laden with billions of dollars' worth of goods. It took a massive six-day salvage operation to free the ship, which is currently anchored in the Great Bitter Lake area of the canal, awaiting resolution of the compensation dispute.

Osama Rabie, head of the SCA, expressed skepticism over an imminent settlement with the Ever Given's Japanese owner, Shoei Kisen. "As of now, we don't see any immediate prospect for resolving the compensation dispute," Rabie remarked.

The UK Club has highlighted that the ship's owners have not been provided with substantial details or evidence that could justify the enormous size of the compensation claim requested by the SCA.

An Egyptian economic court is set to hold a hearing on May 22 to deliberate over the SCA's compensation claim. Earlier investigations by Egypt cleared the SCA and its pilots of any wrongdoing in the incident, potentially paving the way for the canal authority to auction off the Ever Given if its owner refuses to pay the demanded compensation.

Adding to the strife, an Egyptian court has already dismissed an appeal by Shoei Kisen against the detention of the Ever Given, further complicating the legal battle over this incident that has captured global attention.
