Trump to Skip Biden's Inauguration in Break with Tradition

WASHINGTON (AP) – In a move that diverges sharply from U.S. tradition, President Donald Trump has announced he will not attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20. This decision, which underscores the bitter divide between the outgoing and incoming administrations, is seen as an unprecedented act of defiance in the face of a peaceful transition of power.

President-elect Joe Biden, addressing Trump's decision, referred to him as an "embarrassment" and remarked that it is a "good thing" Trump will not be in attendance. Historically, the presence of outgoing presidents at their successor's inauguration has been a visible symbol of the peaceful handover of power, a cornerstone of American democracy.

The announcement has drawn criticism and raised eyebrows across the political spectrum. It is particularly striking because former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton have confirmed their attendance at Biden's inauguration. Jimmy Carter, who is now ailing, will not be in attendance, marking his first absence at an inauguration since he was sworn in as president in 1977.

This development comes amid talks of Trump facing a second impeachment and follows closely on the heels of his suspension from Twitter. Throughout the post-election period, Trump has continued to make unfounded assertions that he won the November election, claiming widespread voter fraud without evidence.

The question of Vice President Mike Pence's attendance remains in the balance, though President-elect Biden has expressed his welcome, distinguishing Pence's potential presence from Trump's.

"Douglas Brinkley, a noted historian, offered a blunt assessment: "Trump's refusal to attend the inauguration lets him stay in the narrative as a sore loser instead of a gracious predecessor. It's an affront to democracy and a sad day for the nation."

As Washington braces for the inauguration, the atmosphere is fraught with tension, exacerbated by discussions among lawmakers about the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment or pursuing impeachment to ensure Trump's removal from office even in his final days.

Sen. Rick Scott, a Republican from Florida, shared, "It's a regrettable situation altogether. The fact that we're even discussing this is a testament to how far we've veered off the path of traditional governance and decorum."

The Vice President's spokesperson, Devin O'Malley, has been notably reserved, stating, "Vice President Pence has always brought dignity and respect to his office. His plans regarding the inauguration remain under consideration, and any decision will prioritize the best interests of the country."

Echoing a sense of finality to Trump's decision, White House spokesperson Judd Deere remarked, "President Trump continues to focus on his agenda and the well-being of the American people."

As the nation moves closer to the inauguration, the absence of a unifying moment between the outgoing and incoming presidents underscores the polarization bedeviling American politics. Trump's decision not to attend Biden's inauguration not only breaks with a long-standing tradition but also, as historian Douglas Brinkley notes, raises concerns about the healthy functioning of the country's democratic institutions.

"By choosing to absent himself from the inaugural ceremony, Trump may well be remembered as a president who prioritized personal grievances over the welfare of the nation," Brinkley added.

Amidst concerns over security and the COVID-19 pandemic, Biden's inauguration is set to be historically unique, with or without the presence of his predecessor. As discussions continue regarding Pence's attendance and potential political repercussions of Trump's final decisions in office, the country looks forward to a new chapter, albeit under the shadow of unprecedented discord.
