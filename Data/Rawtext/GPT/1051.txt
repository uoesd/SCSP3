Witnesses Describe Tense Last Sighting of Gabby Petito in Wyoming Restaurant

In a harrowing account that sheds new light on the days leading up to Gabby Petito's tragic demise, eyewitnesses have come forward to Fox News Digital with details of an altercation between Petito and her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, at a Jackson Hole restaurant. The incident, occurring just weeks before Petito's body was discovered in Wyoming, has become a crucial piece of the puzzle in the ongoing investigation into her death.

Nina Celie Angelo and Matthew England, a couple visiting from New Orleans, reported witnessing a tense argument involving Petito, Laundrie, and the staff of Merry Piglets, a restaurant in Jackson Hole, on Aug. 27. The restaurant has since confirmed the couple's presence that day and notified the FBI of the altercation.

Angelo vividly recalled Laundrie's aggressive demeanor during the incident. "He was visibly angry, going in and out of the restaurant several times, and aggressively arguing with the staff, possibly over the bill," she told Fox News Digital. Laundrie's confrontational behavior was so pronounced that Petito felt compelled to apologize for him, according to Angelo.

Despite the severity of the incident, both the restaurant's manager and local law enforcement told Fox News Digital they could not recall the dispute, and the FBI declined to comment on this specific event. However, Angelo and England felt compelled to come forward after making the connection between the couple they had seen and the individuals in the Utah police bodycam footage released amid the search for Petito.

"It was only after we saw the bodycam video that we realized who they were and recalled the entire incident at Merry Piglets," Angelo explained. Recognizing the significance of their account, England, a financial adviser, took it upon himself to report their observations to the FBI. "Given the timeline and the nature of the confrontation, I felt it was important to inform the authorities about what we had witnessed," he said.

The altercation at Merry Piglets occurred roughly two weeks after another reported confrontation between Petito and Laundrie in Moab, Utah. This earlier incident, which resulted in police intervention, did not lead to any charges but further highlights the volatility surrounding the couple's relationship during their ill-fated cross-country trip.

Tragically, Petito's remains were found at a remote campsite north of Jackson Hole a few weeks after the restaurant incident, marking a grim end to a nationwide search that captured America's attention. Laundrie returned to his home in Florida alone on Sept. 1, with Petito nowhere to be found, and later went missing himself amid growing scrutiny.

The eyewitness account from Angelo and England adds another layer of complexity to the investigation into Petito's death, providing potential insight into the couple's dynamics and the events leading up to the tragic conclusion of their journey. As the case continues to unfold, authorities and the public alike are left to piece together the final days of Gabby Petito's life in an effort to understand what went so terribly wrong.
