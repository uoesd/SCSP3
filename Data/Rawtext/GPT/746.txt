Trump Suggests Baldwin's Fatal Shooting on 'Rust' Set Could Be Intentional

In a shocking accusation, former President Donald Trump has suggested that Alec Baldwin may have intentionally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of 'Rust'. During his appearance on a conservative podcast hosted by Chris Stigall, Trump openly questioned the motive behind Baldwin pointing a gun at Hutchins, leading to her tragic death in October.

The incident, which has shaken Hollywood and sparked discussions on set safety, occurred when Baldwin fired a prop gun containing a live round, mistakenly taking Hutchins's life. Authorities have since been investigating the calamity, but no charges have yet been filed against Baldwin. The actor, for his part, has stated he is 'fully cooperating' with the ongoing investigation.

Trump expressed deep suspicion of Baldwin during the podcast. "How do you take a gun, aim it at somebody that's not even involved in what you're doing, pull the trigger, and now she's dead," Trump remarked, adding his disbelief over the actor's actions on that fateful day.

The former president did not hold back in his critique of Baldwin, describing him as a "cuckoo-bird" and "nutjob." He insinuated that Baldwin, with whom he has had a tumultuous public relationship, primarily due to Baldwin's portrayal of Trump on 'Saturday Night Live', might have played a role in the incident.

Trump further elaborated on his doubts, questioning the rationale behind Baldwin's handling of the weapon. "Why was he pointing a gun at the cinematographer and pulling the trigger? It doesn't make sense. You never point a gun at somebody," Trump pointed out.

Alec Baldwin has consistently expressed his devastation over the incident, sharing his sorrow and shock over Hutchins's death. "There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins," Baldwin said in a statement. He has also expressed his sympathy for Hutchins's family, committing to support them through their grief.

In response to the tragic occurrence, Baldwin has advocated for greater firearms safety measures on film and television sets, suggesting a police presence to oversee the handling of weapons. This proposal was shared through a tweet from his art foundation, signaling Baldwin's commitment to preventing such incidents in the future.

While no specific details about the timing or location of Trump's podcast interview were provided, the former president's controversial remarks have added another layer to the ongoing debate about safety protocols in filmmaking and the accountability of individuals involved in such tragic accidents.

As the investigation continues, the entertainment industry and its observers are left to ponder the implications of Trump's assertions, Baldwin's responsibility, and the broader issues of safety and responsibility on movie sets.
