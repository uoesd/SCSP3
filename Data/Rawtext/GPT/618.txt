Strengthening Bonds: Vice President Harris's Remarks on U.S.-Ghana Relations

Washington, D.C. - In a significant gesture of friendship and diplomatic camaraderie, Vice President Kamala Harris extended a warm welcome to President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana during his visit to the White House. The meeting underscored the enduring relationship between the United States and Ghana, a bond that has flourished since Ghana officially became an independent nation in 1957.

Vice President Harris remarked, "Our bilateral relationship, though officially beginning in 1957, is enshrined in much longer-standing ties that bind our two nations. It is a bond that has grown stronger over the decades, reflective of our shared values and mutual interests."

Highlighting the deep cultural connections that bind the two countries, Vice President Harris touched upon the meaningful journeys many Americans make to Ghana. "For countless Americans, traveling to Ghana is a profound journey of discovery and understanding - a quest to trace their ancestry and understand the history of slavery. This illustrates the deeply personal ties that many Americans feel towards Ghana, enriching our relationship beyond diplomatic and economic engagements."

Both nations have demonstrated a commitment to uphold the principles of democracy, a value deeply cherished and rigorously upheld by both Ghana and the United States. "Ghana's record of free and fair elections is commendable. It underscores our shared belief that the strength of a democracy lies in the full participation of its citizens, and it is weakened whenever individuals are excluded from participating," said Harris.

Amid the global challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Vice President emphasized the collaborative efforts between the two countries in combating the virus and preparing for future global health crises. "Our countries have stood shoulder to shoulder in the fight against COVID-19," she noted. "Through cooperation and resource-sharing, including the United States' contribution of over 1.2 million doses of the Moderna vaccine and the forthcoming 1.3 million Pfizer vaccine doses to Ghana, we reinforce our commitment to global health and safety."

The economic ties between the United States and Ghana have been gaining momentum, with American companies increasingly making their mark in Ghana. "The Ghanaian government's respect for the rule of law and human rights has created a confidence-inspiring environment, encouraging more American businesses to establish a presence in Ghana. This expanding economic relationship is a testament to our mutual aspirations for prosperity," commented Harris.

Looking forward, Vice President Harris expressed enthusiasm for continued collaboration between the two nations, including their interaction within the framework of the United Nations Security Council. "As we face global challenges, our partnership - grounded in mutual respect, shared values, and common goals - will continue to be a source of strength. Together, we can achieve great things for our nations and for the world," she concluded, signaling a bright future for U.S.-Ghana relations.
