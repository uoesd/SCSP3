Chris Wallace Bids Farewell to Fox News, Moves to CNN's Streaming Platform

Veteran journalist Chris Wallace announced his exit from Fox News after an impressive 18-year tenure, marking the end of a significant chapter in his broadcasting career. During his final Fox News Sunday broadcast, Wallace revealed his departure was motivated by a desire to explore new opportunities. "After 18 years at Fox News, I have decided to try something new," Wallace stated, highlighting his anticipation for the challenges and innovations that lie ahead.

This new chapter for Wallace will see him venturing into the realm of digital media with CNN's upcoming streaming service. "I look forward to the new freedom and flexibility streaming affords in interviewing major figures across the news landscape – and finding new ways to tell stories," shared Wallace in a statement released by CNN. His departure aligns with the expiration of his contract with Fox News, Variety reported, signaling a well-timed transition for the prominent journalist.

Fox News expressed gratitude for Wallace's contributions over the years and assured viewers that the tradition of excellence Fox News Sunday is known for would persist. "We are proud of our journalism and the stellar team that Chris Wallace was a part of for 18 years. The show will continue delivering critical analysis and insight from expert guests with rotating anchors until a permanent host is named," the network commented.

Wallace's decision to leave Fox News followed his criticism of the network's decision to air Tucker Carlson's controversial series "Patriot Purge," which propagated conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. This disagreement highlighted the growing tensions between Wallace's journalistic ethos and the direction of some of Fox's programming.

Colleagues and viewers alike have reacted to Wallace's departure, with Bret Baier, a fellow Fox News anchor, taking to Twitter to celebrate Wallace's legacy: "Chris Wallace has been a mentor and friend throughout my entire career. His legacy at Fox is unparalleled and he will be greatly missed."

The exit of Wallace is part of a broader trend of high-profile transitions within the media industry, including Brian Williams from NBC and the firing of Chris Cuomo by CNN. Known for his meticulous and tough interviewing style, Wallace has moderated presidential debates in both 2016 and 2020, demonstrating his critical role in political journalism.

Despite facing criticism from various quarters, Wallace has staunchly defended his impartiality. He contends that like Fox News, other networks such as CNN and MSNBC feature opinion-based programming that leans towards a liberal agenda, underscoring the challenges of maintaining objectivity in today's polarized media landscape.

As Chris Wallace embarks on this new endeavor with CNN's streaming service, the industry watches closely, anticipating how his move will influence the future of news broadcasting and digital storytelling. His legacy at Fox News, characterized by fearless journalism and a commitment to truth, sets a high bar for his successors and for the evolution of news media in the digital age.
