Trump Defense Accuses Democrats of 'Hatred' in Impeachment Trial

WASHINGTON (AP) – In the Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, his defense attorneys accused Democrats of engaging in a prolonged campaign of 'hatred' against him over the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. They argued that Trump's exhortations for his supporters to 'fight like hell' were part of standard political speech, and not an incitement to violence or an attempt to subvert the election results.

Trump's legal team aimed to dismantle the case for his conviction by playing numerous clips of Democrats using similarly combative language in political settings, suggesting that Trump's rhetoric was no different. They contended that the president did not incite the riot and that his words were taken out of context. "The first amendment does not on its face apply to elected officials all the time," expressed Michael van der Veen, Trump's lawyer, emphasizing the defense's view that Trump's speech was protected.

The defense utilized less than three of their allowed 16 hours for their arguments, focusing heavily on drawing parallels between Trump's rhetoric and the language used by Democrats. This, they argued, showed the impeachment is a politically motivated attempt to silence a viewpoint. Despite this, the Senate appears to be moving towards an expeditious final vote and a likely acquittal for Trump, given that a two-thirds majority is required for conviction.

Democrats have countered the defense's arguments by highlighting that Trump's months-long campaign undermining the integrity of the 2020 election results played a pivotal role in setting the stage for the Capitol riot. Some senators, particularly Democrats, responded with amusement or outright dismissed the comparisons made by Trump's defense as mere distractions from the issue at hand.

Following the presentations, senators had the opportunity to ask questions, where some Republicans expressed skepticism regarding the defense's portrayal of Trump's conduct. In response, Trump's lawyers maintained that the former president was within his rights to challenge the election results and argued that the violence at the Capitol was planned independently of Trump's speech. They continued to assert that his actions and rhetoric fall under the protection of the First Amendment, countering the Democrats' depiction of Trump as the 'inciter in chief.'
