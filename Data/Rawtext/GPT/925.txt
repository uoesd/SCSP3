MFA Introduces Carrie Mae Weems' "RESIST COVID/TAKE 6": Art and Awareness in the Times of Pandemic

The Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) in Boston is currently featuring an evocative collection of artist posters as part of Carrie Mae Weems's "RESIST COVID/TAKE 6" project, a public awareness campaign designed to shed light on the COVID-19 pandemic's disproportionate impact on communities of color. This project aims to use art as a medium to foster conversation and action around the racial inequities exacerbated by the pandemic.

One of the striking posters in the exhibition displays a compelling black-and-white photograph of a Black man, capturing attention and aiming to raise awareness about the pandemic's severe toll on minority communities. This visual not only serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing health crisis but also underscores the systemic racism prevalent in our society.

RESIST posters, along with fliers and digital banners, are not confined to the museum walls but have been distributed across various public spaces in Boston and other major cities. This strategy ensures that the message reaches a broad audience, engaging people in the places where they live and work.

Edward Saywell, chair of the MFA's Prints and Drawings department, has attested to the campaign's wide-reaching impact, describing it as "a global movement that speaks to our collective crisis." This suggests an ambitious aim of the project to foster a worldwide dialogue on these pressing issues.

Carrie Mae Weems, the influential artist behind the campaign, initiated the project during the early lockdowns, with the MFA joining the effort in December. Weems's campaign encompasses a range of messages, including the call for recognition of systemic racism, the violence afflicted upon minority communities, the importance of vaccination, and expressing gratitude towards frontline workers.

Kristen Gresh, the MFA's senior photography curator, emphasized the campaign's multifaceted approach: "These posters carry dual messages. They discuss the systemic violence against people of color while also pointing to the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on these communities."

Indeed, another poster in the collection promotes vaccination as the vital defense against the virus, aligning with public health recommendations while also tapping into the broader conversation on access to healthcare in minority communities.

The project not only demonstrates the power of collaboration in art and public health awareness but also highlights the critical role of public art in promoting community connection and fostering public dialogue.

It also notably aligns with the MFA's commitment to making art accessible to a broader audience. "Art forms that are accessible from the street have always been crucial to the mission of the MFA, and this project reinforces that commitment," Saywell remarked.

By placing these important messages in public spaces, the MFA and Carrie Mae Weems aim to spark conversations that bridge the gap between art, public awareness, and social action. This project stands as a testament to the power of art to illuminate public health crises and the systemic injustices that underpin them.

As our cities and communities continue to navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic, the "RESIST COVID/TAKE 6" campaign serves as a critical reminder of the disparities it has unveiled and the urgent need for a collective response to address them. Through this partnership, the MFA and Carrie Mae Weems are not just displaying art but engaging in a much-needed dialogue about race, health, and justice in the era of COVID-19.
