Biden Administration Inherits Trump's Iran-Focused Social Media Campaign

The Biden administration is stepping into a complex legacy left by the Trump administration related to Iran, particularly in the form of a social media campaign designed to engage Iranian citizens by openly criticizing their leaders. This digital initiative, primarily conducted in Farsi, significantly increased its reach under Trump, with the State Department's Instagram followers expanding from 147,000 in January 2019 to a staggering 759,000 by January 2021.

This concerted effort spread across various social media platforms, aiming to exert "maximum pressure" on Iran's ruling clerics. Despite the Iranian government's block on Facebook and Twitter, Instagram remains accessible within the country, with citizens often turning to VPNs to bypass restrictions on other platforms. The campaign's most successful posts echoed support for anti-government protests and celebrated Iran's culture before the Islamic Revolution, indicating a targeted strategy to resonate with the populace's sentiments.

Former President Trump's Farsi tweets, especially those advocating for Iranian protests, drew notable attention and approval within the digital community. These messages, however, were met with disdain from the Iranian government. "Hands and tongues smeared with threats, sanctions, and terror cannot be beautiful," stated Abbas Mousavi, then Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, critiquing Trump's tweets and his use of the Persian language.

Gabriel Noronha, responsible for managing the State Department's Farsi social media channels during Trump's tenure, highlighted the campaign's foundation on the Obama administration's efforts. He emphasized the broader goal of directly communicating with Iranian citizens amidst heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran.

Critics and observers have provided mixed reviews on the effectiveness and reception of such a confrontational social media strategy. Nazenin Ansari, managing editor of Kayhan London and Kayhan Life, noted that some Iranians dismissed or even ridiculed Trump's aggressive posture. This skepticism towards the campaign's intentions and execution signals the challenges inherent in leveraging social media for diplomatic purposes.

Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, pointed out that while the social media campaign under Trump aimed to amplify support for protestors and criticize the regime, it sometimes overshot, making it challenging to gauge its genuine impact among Iranians.

Amid the transition to the Biden administration, there are concerns about how a shift in approach could potentially sideline human rights abuses in Iran. Alireza Nader, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, emphasizes the importance of continuing a robust stance against Iran's government to avoid undermining the struggles and aspirations of the Iranian people.

The new U.S. administration now faces the task of balancing an assertive digital diplomacy strategy with the nuances of engaging a complex and diverse Iranian audience. As the Biden administration assesses its inherited social media campaign, the evolving dynamics of U.S.-Iran relations and the broader Middle East will likely play a critical role in shaping future policies and initiatives aimed at promoting change through digital engagement.
