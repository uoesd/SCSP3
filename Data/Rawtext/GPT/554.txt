Families Appeal for UK Help after Kabul Airport Tragedy

In the wake of the devastating Kabul airport attack, families of Afghan victims have reached out to the British government, seeking urgent assistance to relocate their wounded and bereaved loved ones to the UK. Among the British citizens affected was Musa Popal, a 60-year-old shopkeeper whose family now feels sidelined in their time of grief.

Popal's family is not alone in their anguish. A 23-month-old baby, Muhammad Raza, lies critically injured in a Kabul hospital, having undergone surgery to remove shrapnel. His mother, Basbibi, tearfully appeals for help: "My baby was born free, but now he's trapped in pain. We're pleading for a chance to bring him to safety."

The Ministry of Defence has been clear in its stance, stating that only UK nationals and Afghans who had already been processed would be considered for airlift. This policy comes amidst extraordinary evacuation efforts which saw the British government airlift 15,000 people from Kabul, including 2,200 children, in a desperate race against time.

An emblem of hope amidst the chaos was the birth of a baby girl, Havva, on an RAF evacuation flight destined for Birmingham. This miraculous event highlighted the dramatic range of human experiences unfolding during the evacuation.

However, the somber reality for many remains unchanged. Zohra Popal, Musa Popal's daughter, voiced her fears over her mother's safety in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. "We're living a nightmare. We lost our father, and now we fear losing our mother too," she shared.

Musa Popal, who held both British and Afghan citizenship, had moved to the UK in 1999, building a life for himself and his family. Tragically, another Londoner, Mohammad Niazi, along with his wife and two children, also perished in the attack. Imran Niazi, a friend of the family, mourned, "It's an unbearable loss. Mohammad went to Kabul hoping to bring his family to safety, only to encounter tragedy."

Approximately 170 Afghan civilians and 13 US military personnel were estimated to have lost their lives in the attack, marking it as one of the deadliest incidents in the final days before the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. As families continue their appeals, the shadow of the Kabul airport tragedy looms large, underscoring the desperate need for international cooperation and assistance in the face of overwhelming grief and chaos.
