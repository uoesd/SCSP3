Harris Blasts Trump's Call to Georgia Secretary of State as 'Abuse of Power'

In a scalding critique, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on Sunday lambasted President Donald Trump for his recent phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, urging the state official to overturn the election results. Addressing supporters at a drive-thru rally in Savannah, Georgia, Harris did not mince words, describing the president's actions as a "bald-faced, bold abuse of power."

The recorded conversation, which was first reported by the Washington Post and later obtained by CNN, has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, with Harris and other Democrats denouncing the move as an outright attack on the integrity of the United States' electoral process.

Senior adviser to President-elect Joe Biden, Bob Bauer, echoed Harris's sentiments, calling the conversation a "disgraceful story about Donald Trump's assault on American democracy." Bauer's statement highlights the growing concern among Biden's team over the president's continued efforts to dispute the 2020 election results.

In the recorded audio, President Trump can be heard pressuring Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to "find" votes to overturn Biden's victory in the state. This extraordinary attempt to alter the outcome of the election comes after numerous failed legal challenges and unsupported claims of widespread voter fraud by Trump and his allies.

During her speech, Harris emphasized the vital role Georgia played in securing the electoral college victory for Biden and herself. She criticized the opposition's relentless questioning of the electoral process, viewing it as a direct threat to democracy. "They have the gall to challenge our clear victory in Georgia and across the country," Harris stated, underscoring the absurdity of the allegations against the electoral process.

The January 2 audio leak of Trump's call, which also included White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and several lawyers, has prompted widespread condemnation. In the call, Trump makes numerous unfounded claims about the election results in Georgia, which Raffensperger and his office have repeatedly debunked.

Additionally, Harris rebuked Trump's claims that the January 5 Senate runoff elections were "illegal and invalid." This particular critique comes amidst a pivotal moment for control of the Senate, with the outcome of the Georgia races determining which party will hold the majority.

Harris also voiced her concern over the representation of Black women in the Senate following her resignation to assume the vice presidency. "The stakes could not be higher," she said, highlighting the importance of diverse representation in American politics.

Senate candidate Jon Ossoff, who is running in one of the critical runoff elections, accused the president of attempting to disenfranchise Black voters in Georgia. Referring to Trump's actions and the silence from current Georgia Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, Ossoff stated, "This is an attack on Black voters. Period. And it's an attack on our democracy. It's an attack on free and fair elections, and it must be condemned by all Americans."

Both Senators Perdue and Loeffler, facing tight runoff races, have yet to make substantial comments on Trump's call with Raffensperger. Their lack of defense for Georgia voters, particularly in light of such an unprecedented attempt to overturn the state's election results, has not gone unnoticed.

In her speech, Harris urged Georgians to recognize the power of their vote, especially in light of the ongoing attempts to undermine it. "Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. And don't let anyone ever take your power from you," she remarked, encouraging attendees to make their voices heard in the upcoming runoff elections.

As the fallout from Trump's controversial call continues to unfold, the political battleground in Georgia has taken center stage in a national dialogue about democracy, voter rights, and the peaceful transfer of power. With the Senate runoffs fast approaching, all eyes are on Georgia as it plays a critical role in shaping the future of American politics.
