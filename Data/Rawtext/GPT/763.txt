"Rust" Executive Producer Speaks Out Amid Union Criticism and Tragic On-Set Shooting

In light of a tragic shooting on the set of the Western film "Rust," executive producer Allen Cheney defends his and co-producer Emily Salveson's involvement, asserting that their roles were strictly limited to providing financial backing to the production. The incident, which resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injury of director Joel Souza, has reignited discussions about safety protocols on film sets.

Cheney's statement comes after the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) critiqued the production for hiring a non-union crew following a union worker walkout. "Our involvement in 'Rust' was simply as financiers... Our role was limited to that of providing financial backing for the production," Cheney explained, emphasizing that the final decisions rested with other members of the production team.

In his defense, Cheney highlighted the production's union certifications, stating, "'Rust' is union-certified and in good standing with all major production unions, including IATSE, the Teamsters, SAG, and DGA." These assertions aim to counteract any notion that the production cut corners regarding union involvement and safety regulations.

The fatal incident occurred when assistant director Dave Halls handed Alec Baldwin a prop firearm, assuring him it was safe. Unfortunately, the weapon discharged, leading to Hutchins' untimely death and Souza's injury. This accident has prompted a wave of outcry and demands for improved safety measures across the industry.

Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz weighed in on the incident, emphasizing the lasting impact such accidents have on the film industry. "Accidents like this cause permanent damage, not just to the individuals and families involved, but to the perception of safety on movie sets," Koretz stated. His words reflect a broader concern for the reputation and safety standards of film production environments.

In the wake of the shooting, legal commentator Nancy Grace suggested that actor Alec Baldwin, who was handling the firearm at the time, could potentially face charges of negligent homicide. "Given the circumstances, Alec Baldwin could be looking at negligence charges," Grace noted, highlighting the legal implications of the tragic event.

Currently, "Rust" production has been halted pending a thorough police investigation into the circumstances surrounding the shooting. This pause underlines the severity of the incident and the industry's need to re-evaluate on-set safety protocols.

The broader conversation has shifted towards how film sets can ensure such a tragedy is never repeated. With calls for more rigorous safety protocols and clearer guidelines on the use of prop firearms, the incident has become a rallying point for advocates of safer working conditions in the film industry.

As this story develops, many within and outside the film community are awaiting further details on how "Rust" will proceed and what changes might be implemented industry-wide to prevent future accidents.

In an effort to gain deeper insight into the incident and its aftermath, Newsweek attempted to reach Allen Cheney for further comment. As discussions around set safety and union involvement continue, the film industry is at a pivotal moment, facing calls for significant reforms to ensure the well-being of all who work within it.
