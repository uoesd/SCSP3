Melania Trump Discovers Her Absence at Biden's Inauguration Through a Tweet

In an unexpected revelation, former First Lady Melania Trump learned of her non-attendance at President Joe Biden's inauguration through a tweet from her husband, former President Donald Trump. This late announcement, made on January 8, clarified speculation surrounding the Trumps' attendance at the traditional transfer of power, marking a deviation from longstanding presidential customs.

Until the tweet, there had been uncertainty over whether the Trumps would follow the tradition of attending their successors' inauguration. Their absence ultimately symbolized a stark departure from the peaceful transition of power, a cornerstone of American democracy. Throughout the tumultuous period following the 2020 election, Melania Trump has remained notably quiet about the efforts made by her husband and his allies to contest the election results.

Notwithstanding her silence, Melania has been supportive of her husband's cause, echoing his calls for "fair elections" following his electoral defeat. A senior White House staffer recounted how Melania often finds herself in the dark about her husband's decisions until they are publicly announced on social media. "She frequently learns about what he's doing when he tweets about it," the staffer shared under the condition of anonymity.

As the end of Donald Trump's presidency drew near, Melania began preparing for life outside the nation's capital. She has been actively involved in transitioning her family to their post-presidential residence, organizing the move of personal belongings to the Trump family's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Additionally, she has ensured that her son, Barron Trump, would continue his education in Florida, securing his enrollment in a school there.

In the days following the Capitol insurrection on January 6, Melania opted for silence, choosing not to make an immediate statement about the violence that shocked the nation and the world. It was not until five days later that she released a statement. In it, she expressed sympathy for both the rioters and the police officers who lost their lives during the chaos.

Melania's response to the insurrection, however, wasn't solely focused on condolences. She used the opportunity to lash out at her critics for spreading what she described as "salacious gossip" and "false misleading accusations" against her. This condemnation hinted at the former First Lady's frustration with the ongoing scrutiny and criticism directed toward her and her husband's actions during their time in and after the White House.

As the Trump family adjusts to their life after the presidency, the circumstances surrounding their departure continue to resonate, illustrating the contentious and unprecedented end to Donald Trump's term in office.
