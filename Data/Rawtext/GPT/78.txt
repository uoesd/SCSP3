Justice Department Denies Defending Mo Brooks in Lawsuit, Signaling Trouble for Trump

WASHINGTON, July 29 – In a move that could have significant implications for former President Donald Trump, the U.S. Justice Department has refused to defend Rep. Morris "Mo" Brooks in a lawsuit that accuses him of inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. This decision underscores a broader message that inciting an attack against Congress falls outside the scope of employment for federal employees, including Representatives and potentially, the former President.

Legal experts interpret this development as a clear signal to Trump, indicating that he is unlikely to receive immunity under the Westfall Act for his actions related to the Capitol riot. The act typically provides federal employees immunity from lawsuits over conduct in their official duties. Trump and Brooks are co-defendants in a lawsuit filed by Rep. Eric Swalwell, alleging they incited the Capitol attack in a bid to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's election victory.

Furthermore, Trump faces two additional lawsuits concerning his conduct on and before the Jan. 6 event. While Trump has not yet sought protection from the Justice Department, his primary defense hinges not on the Westfall Act but on the grounds of presidential immunity.

The department's recent stance has stirred concerns among some Democrats. However, others envision it as a move to safeguard the office of the presidency, rather than Trump as an individual. The refusal to defend Brooks, according to legal analysts, signals a possibly stringent approach towards Trump.

Donald Ayer, a former senior Justice Department official, commented on the significance of the decision, stating, "This is significant because it sends a clear message that the Justice Department sees actions encouraging or inciting an insurrection out of bounds for elected officials."

Brooks' attempt to leverage the Westfall Act for immunity was notably rebuffed, marking a potential precursor to the challenges Trump might face. Anne Tindall, an attorney with Protect Democracy, emphasized the decision's implications, noting, "This denial of protection for Brooks underlines the fact that inciting violence against our democratic institutions is universally viewed as unacceptable."

Jesse Binnall, Trump's attorney, did not immediately respond to concerns about how the Justice Department's stance might affect Trump. He has, however, previously asserted that the former president's speech was squarely within his official duties and protected.

The lawsuits against Trump argue that his actions on Jan. 6 far exceeded any legitimate presidential duties, particularly since Trump had no official role in the election certification process, a critical point in his defense challenge.

Legal experts believe Trump's position is even weaker than that of Brooks, due to his lack of a direct role in the certification. "If Brooks can't get immunity, Trump's chances look even bleaker," said one legal scholar, emphasizing the uphill battle Trump could face in seeking immunity for actions on January 6.

In conclusion, the Justice Department's refusal to defend Brooks and the broader implications of this decision spotlight the legally precarious position Trump finds himself in. As the legal challenges mount, it remains to be seen how these developments will unfold in the courtroom and what they mean for the former president's legal defense strategy.
