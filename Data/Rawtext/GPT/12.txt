Fire Near Capitol Sparks Security Alert During Inauguration Rehearsal

WASHINGTON, DC – A fire in a homeless encampment approximately 1.6 kilometres away from the US Capitol complex briefly prompted a lockdown during a rehearsal for President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, raising concerns amid heightened security measures following the January 6 riot.

The incident occurred early Monday morning when smoke was seen rising near the Capitol, which has been on high alert since the attack that sought to overturn the election results. The sight of smoke immediately triggered a swift response from the Capitol Police and other law-enforcement agencies involved in securing the inauguration.

Officials quickly determined that the smoke originated from a fire at a nearby homeless encampment. Despite the proximity to such a critical and sensitive area, authorities confirmed there was no direct threat to the public or the upcoming inauguration.

The evacuation and subsequent lockdown were precautionary measures enacted by the acting chief of Capitol Police, aiming to ensure the safety of all personnel within the complex. President-elect Joe Biden was not on site during the lockdown, as confirmed by inauguration planners.

This scare comes at a time when security measures around the Capitol have been significantly reinforced. In response to the violent events of January 6, when supporters of the outgoing president stormed the Capitol, an unprecedented security perimeter has been established, with thousands of National Guard troops deployed.

During the lockdown, participants in the rehearsal, including members of a military band, were instructed to move to a secure location within the Capitol complex. The prompt and organized response underscored the tense atmosphere in Washington as preparations for the inauguration proceed under extraordinary circumstances.

The US Secret Service, taking to Twitter, reassured the public that the lockdown was purely a precautionary measure and that there was no ongoing threat to the community. The agency is at the forefront of what is considered one of the most challenging inauguration security operations in recent history.

Meanwhile, the fire department managed to extinguish the blaze near the Capitol without any reported injuries. They confirmed the source of the smoke, clarifying the situation and helping to quell any further panic or speculation about potential security threats.

As the nation's capital prepares for the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, this incident serves as a vivid reminder of the heightened state of vigilance and preparedness that has enveloped the city. Officials remain on high alert, ready to respond at a moment's notice to ensure the inauguration can proceed safely and without interruption.
