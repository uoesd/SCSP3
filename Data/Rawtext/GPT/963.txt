Thune Critiques GOP 'Cancel Culture,' Defends Senators Who Convicted Trump

PIERRE, S.D. (AP) – In a recent candid interview, U.S. Sen. John Thune expressed concern over the emerging trend of censures and criticism directed at Republican senators who broke party ranks to convict former President Donald Trump of inciting an insurrection. Thune, the No. 2 GOP leader in the Senate, defended his colleagues' decisions to side with Democrats, describing them as votes of conscience and warned against the peril of suppressing dissent within the party.

Thune's remarks come at a critical juncture for the Republican Party as it grapples with its identity in the aftermath of Trump's tenure and ahead of the 2022 midterms. The senator from South Dakota highlighted the internal conflicts and the primary battles looming within the GOP, underscoring a divide between Trump loyalists and those pushing for a return to traditional conservative principles.

The senator was critical of Trump's conduct post-election, terming his actions to undermine the peaceful transfer of power as 'inexcusable.' However, despite his criticisms, Thune voted to acquit Trump in the recent Senate impeachment trial, siding with the majority of Republican senators who did the same.

"In a moment of reckoning, it was a vote of conscience," Thune said, defending his fellow Republicans' decision to convict or acquit. He stressed the importance of allowing space within the party for varied opinions and cautioned against engaging in what he termed GOP's own version of 'cancel culture' by censuring those who voted to convict Trump.

As the Republican Party faces an introspective period, Thune discussed the need for the party to rally around core principles and priorities under President Joe Biden's administration. He mentioned the proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package as a significant point of contention, indicating a preference for a more targeted approach and a smaller budget.

Thune suggested that assisting GOP candidates who steer clear of conspiracy theories and focus on substantive policy issues could be key to retaking the Senate. He praised Rep. Liz Cheney, who faced backlash for her vote to impeach Trump, for her stance on most issues and her rejection of baseless claims.

The senator expressed optimism about the GOP's chances in the upcoming midterms, attributing it to what he perceives as policy overreaches by the Democrats under Biden's leadership. He believes that if Biden can resist pressures from the progressive wing of his party, there might be a chance for a more moderate governance approach, which could benefit the country broadly.

Reflecting on Republicans' strategic focus, Thune envisaged a return to emphasizing economic policy, fiscal responsibility, strong borders, and a tough stance on China's foreign policy. He argued that such issues resonate with American voters and could pave the way for GOP successes in future elections.

When discussing Biden's coronavirus relief package, Thune acknowledged the need for further economic assistance but voiced concerns over the size and scope of the proposed $1.9 trillion package. He suggested some Republicans might support a more constrained relief effort, emphasizing the need for fiscal responsibility and targeted aid to those most affected by the pandemic's economic fallout.

As the debate over the relief package continues, Thune's comments reflect larger existential questions facing the Republican Party. With internal divisions between Trump's loyalists and traditional conservatives becoming more pronounced, the GOP's path forward appears fraught with challenges.

Despite these challenges, Thune's commitment to traditional conservative values, his critique of the party's current trajectory, and his defense of dissent within GOP ranks suggest that he and like-minded Republicans aim to steer the party towards a more inclusive and policy-focused future.

In conclusion, Thune's perspective on the GOP's internal dynamics, the party's strategy under the Biden administration, and his critique of the current political environment underscore the ongoing struggle for the soul of the Republican Party. As the party seeks to rebuild and refocus, leaders like Thune will play an instrumental role in shaping its direction and in navigating the complexities of American politics in the post-Trump era.
