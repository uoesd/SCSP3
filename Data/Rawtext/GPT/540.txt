Knauss, remembered by peers for his exceptional dedication and by his family for his tender heart, leaves behind a legacy of courage.

One of the youngest victims, Marine Rylee McCollum, was just 20 years old and on his first deployment. Anticipating fatherhood in a matter of weeks, McCollum's loss is felt deeply by his family and the community that had eagerly awaited his return.
