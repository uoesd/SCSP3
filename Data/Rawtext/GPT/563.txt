Fallen Marine Honored at Omaha Lancers Hockey Game

Omaha, NE – At an upcoming Omaha Lancers hockey game, a special seat will remain unoccupied, reserved in honor of Marine Corporal Daegan Page, who tragically lost his life in the Kabul airport attack on August 26. The devastating event at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, claimed the lives of Page and 12 other valiant service members, marking a sorrowful day for the nation.

Corporal Page served valiantly as part of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force based at Camp Pendleton, California. His commitment and sacrifice to his country will be remembered during a poignant ceremony at the Omaha Lancers hockey game against the Sioux Falls Stampede.

The honor comes as part of an initiative by Visiting Angels, who selected the Page family for their Hometown Hero Seat, a tribute aiming to recognize military members, first responders, or their families during the game. This recognition not only celebrates the heroism of these individuals but also keeps their memories alive within the community.

The selection was inspired by Cpl. Page's love for hockey, a passion his mother, Wendy Adelson, fondly recalls. "Daegan grew up loving hockey, a sport that taught him the value of teamwork and determination. Having him honored at a Lancers game, something he would have immensely enjoyed, brings comfort to our hearts. It feels like a fitting way to remember him," Adelson shared.

Page's family will be an integral part of the event, participating in a ceremonial puck-drop that promises to be both a heartfelt and memorable moment. To further honor their son's memory, the family will receive a Lancers sweater, a tangible reminder of the community's support and recognition of Daegan's ultimate sacrifice.

"The Hometown Hero Seat is our way of acknowledging the bravery and the sacrifice of individuals like Corporal Page, who have given so much for our country," said a representative from Visiting Angels. "Its presence during the game serves as a poignant reminder of the costs of freedom."

Wendy Adelson feels that this event serves as a meaningful gesture from a community that continues to support them. "Seeing the community come together to remember Daegan in this special way makes us feel less alone. It reminds us that his sacrifice, and that of others who have fallen, will not be forgotten," Adelson expressed.

Following the puck-drop ceremony and the presentation of the Lancers sweater, the Page family will participate in a media Q&A session. This will provide an opportunity for them to share more about Daegan's legacy and the impact of having their community rally around them in remembrance.

The Omaha Lancers game, thus, goes beyond a mere sporting event, becoming a platform to honor those who have unselfishly served their country, reminding us of the sacrifices made by servicemen and women and their families.
