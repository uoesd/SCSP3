Tragic Shooting on 'Rust' Set: New Details Emerge in Affidavit

In a startling incident that has rippled through Hollywood, the set of the Alec Baldwin film 'Rust' became the scene of a tragic accident last week. As investigations continue, new details have come to light through an affidavit for a search warrant, revealing a complex series of events that led to the unfortunate death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and the wounding of director Joel Souza.

Cameraman Reid Russell redacted by the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department, described Alec Baldwin as being very careful with firearms on the set prior to the accident. "He always made sure a gun was safe before using it," Russell stated. This detail adds a poignant context to the unfolding narrative of what occurred that fateful day.

According to the affidavit, assistant director Dave Halls, who handed Baldwin the prop gun, asserted, "I did not know live rounds were in the prop gun." This statement underscores a critical oversight in the handling of firearms on set.

The document, outlined by Detective Joel Cano, reveals that the shooting took place during a rehearsal of a scene. Baldwin was preparing to film with Hutchins and Souza when the prop gun discharged. Astonishingly, the affidavit indicates that only one bullet was fired, which tragically went through Hutchins and then struck Souza.

In the immediate aftermath, Hutchins reportedly expressed that she could not feel her legs before collapsing and receiving medical attention, highlighting the sudden and severe nature of the incident.

Further complicating the narrative are the behind-the-scenes challenges faced by the 'Rust' crew on the day of the shooting. Detective Cano noted in the affidavit that there had been a walkout by seven camera crew members just hours before the tragedy, protesting conditions. This led to delays as the production scrambled to find a replacement camera crew, hinting at tensions and issues within the team.

Hannah Gutierrez, the film's armorer, was responsible for the weapons on set. After the incident, she retrieved the spent casing from the prop gun, affirming through her actions that only one shot was fired. The protocol for handling firearms and ammunition on set, particularly how live rounds ended up in the prop gun, is a central question in the ongoing investigation.

In the wake of this tragic event, the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department, alongside District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, has announced a joint press conference to provide updates on the investigation. Carmack-Altwies emphasized, "We are committed to a thorough and complete investigation of this tragic incident. Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Halyna Hutchins and to all those affected by this tragedy."

As the community awaits further details from the investigation, the incident has sparked intense discussions about on-set safety protocols, particularly concerning the use of firearms and live ammunition in filmmaking. Director Joel Souza, recovering from his injuries, stated, "The safety of our cast and crew is paramount. We are heartbroken over the loss of Halyna Hutchins, a gifted colleague and friend."

As Hollywood and the broader filmmaking community grapple with the implications of this tragedy, the focus has turned to ensuring such an incident never occurs again. The forthcoming press conference is expected to shed more light on the circumstances that led to this devastating event, as the industry mourns the loss of Halyna Hutchins and seeks paths toward safer filmmaking practices.

This tragedy has not only highlighted critical issues in the handling of weapons on set but has also prompted a reevaluation of safety measures and protocols, calling for change to ensure the well-being of everyone involved in the creative process.
