Taliban Blames U.S. for Kabul Airport Attack Amidst Assurance of Control Over Terrorism

In a shocking assertion following the devastating attack at Kabul airport on August 27, the Taliban has pointed the finger at the United States, claiming it can better manage terrorism within the confines of Afghanistan. The deadly assault, for which ISIS-K, an Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, has already claimed responsibility, marked the grimmest day for U.S. military forces since 2011.

Taliban spokesperson Bilal Karimi delivered a stern criticism of the U.S. evacuation strategy, attributing the chaos and resultant attack at Kabul airport to what he perceives as flawed planning by the United States. "The catastrophe at the Kabul airport was a direct result of the disorganized evacuation plan by the U.S.," declared Karimi. Despite the grim scenario, he assured that measures are in place to control such acts of terrorism going forward.

Amidst concerns for foreign nationals stranded in Afghanistan, Karimi offered assurances that the Taliban would not pose a threat to Spanish nationals or others, instead urging those with valuable knowledge to contribute towards Afghanistan's prosperity. "We encourage individuals possessing necessary expertise and knowledge to aid in Afghanistan's progress. Foreign nationals are forgiven and can lead regular lives, including the legal option to leave the country once the situation stabilizes," Karimi asserted.

In a nation where women's rights have historically been severely restricted under Taliban rule, the organization now claims to advocate for equal rights for women, permitting them to study and work, albeit within the framework of Islamic law. Karimi emphasized the importance of adhering to Islamic dress codes, particularly the wearing of hijabs. "It is crucial for women to wear hijabs. This is to prevent any provocation of men and to ensure compliance with Islamic law," he stated.

This announcement comes at a time when across Afghanistan, women have taken to the streets in protest against the Taliban's conservative and restrictive laws, only to be met with forceful crackdowns by Taliban militants.

The Taliban's swift and unanticipated return to power in Afghanistan followed the withdrawal of U.S. and Western forces, drawing a close to over two decades of foreign military presence. Despite their assignment of blame for the airport attack, it's crucial to note that ISIS-K has already stepped forward claiming responsibility for this tragic incident.

As the Taliban navigates its newfound authority, the world watches intently, gauging whether their recent pronouncements of moderation will translate into tangible changes in governance, particularly regarding women's rights and counter-terrorism efforts in an increasingly volatile region.
