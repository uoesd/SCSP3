CNN's 'Cuomo Prime Time' Hits Viewer Low Amid Scandals Surrounding Host's Brother

CNN's flagship evening show, 'Cuomo Prime Time,' hosted by Chris Cuomo, is facing a significant drop in viewership, reaching its lowest numbers since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. This decline comes amidst multiple scandals involving Cuomo's brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.

The show, which once boasted robust ratings, especially during the early months of the global pandemic, averaged just 1.31 million viewers in the week of March 15. This represents a steep fall from its 2020 viewer average of 1.8 million, reflecting a severe ratings slump for the prime-time host. Notably, the decline is not limited to overall viewership but extends to key demographic metrics, including adults aged 25-to-54, further underscoring the program's struggling performance.

This downturn in viewership coincides with a tumultuous period for the Cuomo family, as Governor Cuomo faces a series of grave accusations. Allegations range from sexual harassment and making verbal threats to mishandling the reporting of nursing home deaths due to COVID-19 in New York state. These scandals have cast a long shadow over the Cuomo family, affecting Chris Cuomo's standing with viewers.

CNN, historically a ratings powerhouse, has seen a broader viewership decline during this period, falling behind Fox News. The network has faced criticism for its handling of Chris Cuomo's coverage of his brother. Early in the pandemic, CNN allowed the prime-time host to conduct a series of interviews with Governor Cuomo, a move that was widely criticized for blurring journalistic lines and perceived conflict of interest. During these segments, the tone was often congenial, focusing on the state's pandemic response with a fraternal rapport that appealed to some viewers but raised eyebrows among critics.

In a pivot, CNN recently declared that Chris Cuomo would abstain from covering his brother's ongoing scandals, drawing on a network policy that typically prevents journalists from reporting on relatives. This decision marks a notable shift from the network's earlier stance, where an exception was made to allow Cuomo to interview his brother during a time of national crisis.

The connections between CNN and the Cuomo family extend beyond the anchor desk. CNN executive vice president, Allison Gollust, has past ties to Governor Cuomo, having served as his communications director. This relationship has contributed to the perception of an uncomfortably close bond between the network and the embattled governor.

Despite the mounting scandals, Governor Cuomo has steadfastly refused to resign, maintaining his position in the face of bipartisan calls for his departure. The governor's refusal adds another layer of complexity to the situation, further entangling the Cuomo family in public and media scrutiny.

Chris Cuomo's viewership problems point to a larger issue for CNN, as it grapples with balancing journalistic integrity with the personal connections that bind its prime-time star to the news. As developments continue to unfold in the scandals surrounding Governor Cuomo, the question remains how CNN will navigate these tumultuous waters. The network's decision to bar Chris Cuomo from covering his brother's troubles suggests an attempt to maintain journalistic standards, but whether this move will be enough to regain viewer trust and boost ratings remains to be seen.

In a media landscape where credibility and viewer loyalty are paramount, CNN finds itself at a crossroads. The network's handling of the Cuomo saga may very well shape its reputation and viewer relationships for years to come. As 'Cuomo Prime Time' struggles to reclaim its audience, the broader implications for CNN's brand and its place in the cable news hierarchy are significant — underscoring the challenge of maintaining journalistic ethics in a deeply interconnected media world.
