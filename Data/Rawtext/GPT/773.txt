Tragic Accident on 'Rust' Set Preceded by Jensen Ackles' Firearm Training Discussion

Days before a tragic accident on the set of the movie 'Rust' led to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza, actor Jensen Ackles shared insights into his firearm training for the film during a fan event. Sadly, this discussion took on a grim relevance after the accident, which involved Alec Baldwin accidentally discharging a prop gun.

Ackles, known for his long-term role in the TV series "Supernatural," had his comments on firearm handling widely circulated online, although the clip has been removed from several platforms in the aftermath of the shooting. He had detailed a brief session on how to load and fire a prop gun, facilitated by the film's armorer, focusing on the specifics of handling the weapon safely.

The accident occurred when Baldwin, who was handling the prop gun, inadvertently fired it, causing the fatal injuries to Hutchins and wounding Souza. While there has been no suggestion that Ackles was present or involved in the scene of the shooting, the incident has brought intense scrutiny to the safety protocols on set, particularly concerning the use of firearms.

Alec Baldwin, deeply affected by the incident, took to Twitter to express his devastation, stating, "There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother, and deeply admired colleague of ours. I'm fully cooperating with the police investigation to address how this tragedy occurred."

The Santa Fe County sheriff's office has launched an investigation into the incident, particularly focusing on the type of projectile that was discharged and the circumstances of its firing. A spokesman for the Santa Fe County sheriff remarked, "We are actively investigating the type and nature of the projectile discharged. Our primary goal is to determine how this tragedy occurred."

In light of reports that Baldwin was handed a 'hot gun' — industry slang for a firearm loaded with live ammunition — questions have emerged about the checks and balances in place on set. Baldwin himself was reportedly surprised by the discharge, having not encountered such a situation previously in his career.

Jensen Ackles has yet to make a public statement regarding the accident or to comment on the content of his now-deleted video discussing gun training. The silence adds to the growing list of questions surrounding the incident, as those involved and the wider film industry grapple with the aftermath and the need for stringent safety measures.

The tragedy has not only led to a loss in the film community but has also ignited a wider conversation about the use of firearms in film production and the paramount importance of safety protocols to prevent such incidents from happening in the future.
