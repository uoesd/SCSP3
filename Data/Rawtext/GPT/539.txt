Deadly Blasts at Kabul Airport: Taliban and Western Leaders Respond

DW – 08 – Twin explosions rocked the periphery of Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport, leaving a grim tally of dozens of Afghan civilians and at least 13 US soldiers dead. The blasts, which occurred outside the Abbey Gate of the airport and near the Baron Hotel, have sent shockwaves through the international community, at a time when the efforts to evacuate thousands from Afghanistan are in their most critical phase.

General Kenneth McKenzie, Commander of the US Central Command, confirmed the casualties among the American forces. "We can confirm that 13 US service members were killed in the attack, and 15 more service members were injured," General McKenzie stated solemnly. The attack, claimed by ISIS, underscored the volatile security situation in Kabul, which has deteriorated rapidly since the Taliban's return to power.

President Joe Biden addressed the nation, expressing his grief and frustration over the loss. "We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay," vowed President Biden, insisting that the evacuations would continue despite the attack. He acknowledged the service members' sacrifice, emphasizing their role in saving the lives of others.

Intelligence services had previously warned of a significant threat from the Islamic State, particularly targeting the crowded scenes outside the airport. Despite these warnings, the sheer magnitude of the crowd seeking escape made it difficult to prevent such tragedies.

Ali Latifi, a Kabul-based journalist, described the scene following the explosions as chaotic, with people running for safety amidst the sound of gunfire. "There was blood everywhere, people were screaming," Latifi reported, highlighting the panic and confusion that followed the blasts.

Abdul Matin Amiri, a resident of Kabul, shared his despair over the ongoing situation. "We have lost so much already. These attacks only deepen our wounds," he lamented, reflecting the sentiments of many Afghans caught in the crossfire of geopolitical conflicts.

In response to the attack, the Taliban issued a statement condemning the blasts, attributing them to the presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan. "The Islamic Emirate strongly condemns the bombing of civilians at Kabul's airport, which took place in an area where US forces are responsible for security," the statement read, indicating a complex blame game amidst the unfolding tragedy.

Emergency NGO, active in Kabul, reported that 60 individuals injured in the attacks had been brought to their Surgical Center, with six declared dead upon arrival. The grievous toll highlights the critical need for medical and humanitarian support in the city.

Leaders from Germany, the UK, and France have universally condemned the attack, expressing their condolences and reaffirming their commitments to support Afghanistan through this turbulent period.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the attacks "despicable," committing to continuing the effort to evacuate those at risk. Meanwhile, German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer announced, "All German troops have concluded their operations in Afghanistan and have left the country," marking an end to Germany's military involvement in the region.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated, "We must keep going" with the evacuation, insisting that the attacks wouldn't deter the mission. French President Emmanuel Macron echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and determination in the face of terrorism.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas highlighted the continue effort to evacuate German citizens and Afghan helpers, emphasizing that the attacks underline the urgent need for this mission to proceed.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for an emergency meeting of the Security Council in response to the attacks, underscoring the international community's concern for Afghanistan's future stability and the safety of its people.

As the world reels from the impact of the Kabul airport explosions, the collective resolve among leaders and communities alike is to continue the evacuation efforts, seek justice for the victims, and work towards a stable and peaceful Afghanistan, free from the fear of terrorism. The road ahead remains fraught with challenges, but the tragedy has only strengthened the determination to not let fear dictate the course of action.
