FDA Authorizes First Oral Antiviral for Treatment of COVID-19

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for Pfizer's Paxlovid, marking the advent of the first oral antiviral treatment designed for battling COVID-19. This groundbreaking move authorizes the use of Paxlovid for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients who are at least 12 years old and weigh over 40 kilograms (about 88 pounds). This treatment is specifically aimed at individuals who are considered to be at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. It is important to note that Paxlovid should be prescribed and dosed within five days of the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, ensuring timely intervention for those in need.

Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., Director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, emphasized the significance of this authorization, stating, "The authorization of this oral antiviral marks a major milestone in the fight against COVID-19." She further highlighted the importance of vaccination, noting, "While vaccination remains our best defense against the virus, this treatment offers a much-needed tool in combating the disease for those who become infected." Unlike other treatments, Paxlovid is not approved for use as pre-exposure or post-exposure prevention and is not intended for patients who are already hospitalized due to severe or critical COVID-19.

Paxlovid operates by hindering a specific protein within the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thereby preventing the virus from replicating. This mechanism is supported by the inclusion of ritonavir, which prolongs the antiviral activity of Paxlovid. Clinical trials have shown promising results, with Paxlovid reducing the risk of hospitalization or death by 88% when administered early. However, potential side effects, such as impaired taste, diarrhea, high blood pressure, and muscle aches, should be considered. The drug also has contraindications with certain medications due to potential serious interactions. To assist healthcare providers and patients/caregivers in making informed decisions, fact sheets detailing pertinent information about Paxlovid are mandated under the EUA provisions.
