Australia Halts Afghanistan Evacuation Flights After Kabul Attacks

CANBERRA, Aug 27 (Reuters) – Australia has ceased its evacuation flights from Afghanistan following deadly suicide bombings near Kabul's airport, which caused significant civilian casualties and claimed the lives of at least 13 U.S. military personnel, the government confirmed on Friday.

The decision came after Australia's military personnel managed to evacuate from Kabul merely hours before the attacks occurred. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the situation on the ground has deteriorated to such an extent that continuing the evacuations was deemed unsafe. "We have now moved into a post-evacuation phase, focusing on our humanitarian program going forward," Morrison stated, emphasizing the growing risks in the region.

Despite Australia ending its evacuation efforts, some Western countries are pushing forward with accelerated evacuations, with flights still departing from Kabul. However, Prime Minister Morrison advised that Australian citizens and visa holders still in Afghanistan are unlikely to secure placement on these remaining flights.

The precise number of Australian visa holders remaining in Afghanistan is currently unknown. Morrison expressed concern over their situation, indicating a bleak outlook for their evacuation prospects.

In the past nine days, Australia has successfully evacuated approximately 4,100 citizens and Afghan visa holders, as part of its efforts to assist those fleeing the Taliban's rapid ascendancy to power.

In light of the recent attacks, Foreign Minister Marise Payne has urged Australians and visa holders to stay away from Kabul airport, cautioning against the high risk of further terrorist activities. "The situation on the ground is extremely dangerous, and we advise against attempting to reach the airport for evacuation flights at this point," Payne warned.

The Australian government is also working diligently to ascertain if any of its citizens or residents were among the casualties in the recent bombings. As the international community grapples with the unfolding crisis, Australia remains committed to supporting its citizens and Afghan allies through alternative means.
