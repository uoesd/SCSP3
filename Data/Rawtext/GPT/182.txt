House Intelligence Committee Probes CIA Over Alleged Assange Targeting Plans

In a dramatic turn of events that raises serious concerns over the limits of espionage and the protection of journalistic activities, the House Intelligence Committee is actively seeking information from the CIA regarding alleged plans to target WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange. This inquiry is propelled by an explosive report from Yahoo News, which detailed clandestine plans to kidnap Assange and revealed deep divisions within the Trump administration over the approach.

The alarming revelations have prompted Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee chairman, to publicly state that he was not briefed about these plans back in 2017, a year fraught with political upheaval and controversy. Speaking on the matter, Schiff asserted, "The notion that we would engage in such an activity that could undermine our First Amendment and the role of journalists is deeply troubling. That I, as the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, was not briefed on this matter is equally concerning."

In response to these accusations, the committee has formally reached out to both the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) for comprehensive briefings and documents. This move underscores the seriousness with which Congress is now scrutinizing the covert actions allegedly discussed and, possibly, enacted against Assange and WikiLeaks.

Adding a significant layer of legal and ethical complexity, the ACLU, alongside over twenty other advocacy groups, has called upon Attorney General Merrick Garland to abandon Assange's prosecution. This demand follows closely on the heels of the revelations about the CIA's activities, suggesting a broader debate about the balance between national security and journalistic freedom.

Assange's legal team, on their part, is gearing up to utilize these allegations of CIA misconduct as a central pillar in their argument against his extradition from the UK to the US. This legal battle comes amid charges stemming from WikiLeaks' publication of classified documents, which the US claims endangered national security.

At the heart of the controversy stands former CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who is reported to have been a driving force behind the aggressive stance against WikiLeaks, even considering assassination among the options on the table. However, a kidnapping plan, while debated, was reportedly vetoed by White House lawyers, though other operations targeting WikiLeaks were endorsed and possibly carried out.

Mike Pompeo, in response to the Yahoo News story, confirmed that there was "some truth" to the accounts but staunchly denied any illegal intent to assassinate Assange. "We were always careful to act in a manner consistent with American law," Pompeo stated, offering a defense amid mounting criticism and calls for accountability.

The emergence of these reports has ignited a firestorm of outrage and calls for transparency regarding the US government's actions against WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. With the scrutiny intensifying, the unfolding narrative not only puts the spotlight on the actions of the CIA and the Trump administration but also instigates a broader discussion on the protection of press freedoms and the ethical boundaries of national security operations. As Congress delves deeper into this matter, the world watches, waiting to see where the balance between security, legality, and freedom will ultimately rest.
