Millions Seek $2,000 Monthly Stimulus Payments as Economic Needs Persist

In an effort to rally support for recurring financial assistance, over 2.8 million Americans have signed a Change.org petition demanding $2,000 monthly stimulus payments. Spearheaded by Denver restaurant owner, Stephanie Bonin, the petition is close to hitting a landmark of 3 million signatures, which will place it among the top petitions on the platform.

"Survival is more than a one-time affair," Bonin stated, emphasizing the urgency for ongoing economic support amid the pandemic. Her call for immediate and continuous payments reflects the ongoing financial struggles faced by many Americans, even as the pandemic's tightest grip seems to be loosening.

Bonin's petition is not alone in its quest for additional financial relief. Five other petitions on Change.org, carrying similar demands for monthly stimulus checks, are drawing considerable attention. This collective push underscores a significant portion of the population still in need of support.

However, despite these vocal demands, the likelihood of a fourth stimulus check from either the White House or Congress remains slim at this time. Economic indicators pointing to recovery, and the current focus of legislative efforts on infrastructure and social spending, have pushed further direct payments down the agenda.

To date, there has been no legislation passed under the Biden administration or by Congress for a fourth stimulus check. Contrary to circulating rumors, there are no verified plans to distribute a $7,000 fourth stimulus check this week.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government has distributed three rounds of stimulus payments to eligible Americans. The first round, in March 2020, offered up to $1,200 per individual. This was followed by payments of $600 in December 2020, and up to $1,400 in March 2021. These stimulus checks played a critical role in aiding Americans through the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, yet many like Bonin argue that the need for further assistance remains critical.
