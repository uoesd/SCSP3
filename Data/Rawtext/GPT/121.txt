Former CNN Anchors Launch "The Handoff" Podcast to Share Unfiltered News Takes and Celebrate Friendship

New York CNN – In a move that intertwines professional insight with personal camaraderie, former CNN anchors Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo have announced the launch of their new podcast, "The Handoff", which promises an in-depth look at their off-camera friendship and straightforward opinions on the latest news events. The podcast's title captures the essence of their relationship, originating from the nightly exchange between their respective former shows, 'Cuomo Prime Time' and 'Don Lemon Tonight'.

"The Handoff" is inspired by the genuine and spontaneous moment that occurred every night on CNN, where the baton was passed from 'Cuomo Prime Time' to 'Don Lemon Tonight'. This transition was more than just a scheduling alignment; it became a signature moment that highlighted their natural chemistry and authentic interactions, something both Cuomo and Lemon seek to extend through their podcast.

Reflecting on their on-screen exchanges, Chris Cuomo shared, "What we did on air, it wasn't produced; it was just us being us. There was a certain randomness and originality to it that I think people really appreciated." Their conversations, often marked by a mix of serious discussions and light-hearted banter, showcased not just their professional rapport but a deeper, personal connection.

Indeed, both hosts emphasize the realness of their friendship, which stands out in an industry where genuine bonds can be rare. "It's not often you find true friendship in the media spotlight, but with Chris, it's different," Lemon said, pointing out that the diversity within their off-screen friendships adds another layer to their dynamic.

Chris Cuomo elaborated on the significance of their time together away from the cameras, suggesting that it has reinforced their bond. "Our off-air time together isn't just filler; it's where some of our best conversations happen, making our connection on and off screen quite unique," he explained.

The launch of "The Handoff" comes at a time of considerable political and social upheaval, with both hosts acknowledging that their collaborative periods were among the most memorable and impactful of their careers. This period has not only fortified their professional partnership but has also deepened their friendship.

The spontaneity and sincerity of their interactions, which audiences have come to enjoy, are central themes of the podcast. According to Don Lemon, "There's something special about the unpredictability and honesty of our exchanges that resonates with people. We're bringing that same energy to 'The Handoff'."

As they venture into this new project, the camaraderie and mutual respect between the two are palpable. Their conversations often culminate in expressions of affection, with both Lemon and Cuomo openly sharing their appreciation for each other. "It's a rare thing to find someone in this industry who you can genuinely call a friend. Chris is that friend to me," Lemon stated, encapsulating the sentiment that underscores their new endeavor.

"The Handoff" aims to offer listeners a blend of insightful commentary on the week's news, behind-the-scenes looks at their unique friendship, and the unscripted moments that have defined their time at CNN.

As the podcast rolls out, it's clear that Lemon and Cuomo are not just co-hosts but cherished friends, eager to bring their loyal viewers along as they embark on this new chapter together. Ending their announcement with a mutual expression of love, they reminded their audience of the depth of their bond, a fitting foundation for a venture that promises to be as enlightening as it is entertaining.
