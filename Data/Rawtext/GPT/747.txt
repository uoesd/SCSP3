New Mexico Judge Orders Interview with Assistant Director in Alec Baldwin Film Set Shooting

SANTA FE, N.M. – A New Mexico district judge has demanded that assistant director Dave Halls, who passed Alec Baldwin a prop gun that tragically killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, cooperate with an interview by state workplace safety regulators. The order, issued on October 21, stems from the fatal incident on the Bonanza Creek Ranch film set near Santa Fe, capturing national attention and raising questions about safety protocols in the film industry.

The subpoena, authorized by District Judge Bryan Biedscheid on Friday, came from the Occupational Health and Safety Bureau of the state Environment Department. Despite previous requests, Halls declined two attempts for an interview, pointing to the ongoing criminal investigation into the event.

Halls' involvement in the case is significant due to his responsibilities in ensuring set safety and his direct handling of the prop gun before the fatal shooting. The regulators' request for his testimony underlines the importance of understanding the sequence of events leading up to Hutchins' death.

Despite not responding to the latest developments, Halls' attorney, Lisa Torracco, has indicated her client's willingness to cooperate with the investigation. "We look forward to clarifying Mr. Halls' involvement in this tragic incident," Torracco stated, emphasizing the effort to provide clarity on the matter.

Rebecca Roose, Deputy Cabinet Secretary of the Environment Department, emphasized the critical nature of Halls' testimony. "Mr. Halls' perspective is crucial to comprehensively understanding the failures in safety protocols on the set," Roose said. "This interview will aid in dissecting the chain of custody of the weapon used and identifying lapses in safety measures."

Alec Baldwin, for his part, has consistently stated that he was unaware the prop gun contained a live round, highlighting the urgent need to ascertain who was responsible for loading the gun. As the investigation proceeds, both state regulators and the film industry closely watch, hoping for answers that might prevent similar tragedies in the future.
