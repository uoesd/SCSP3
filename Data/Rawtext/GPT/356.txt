Facebook and YouTube Crack Down on Bolsonaro's COVID-19 Vaccine Claims

RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 25 – Facebook and YouTube have taken down a video shared by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro that linked COVID-19 vaccines to AIDS, in a move to combat the spread of misinformation about the pandemic on their platforms. The companies cited violations of their policies against COVID-19 disinformation as the reason for their actions.

A spokesperson for Facebook stated, "Our policies prohibit content that claims COVID-19 vaccines kill or seriously harm people." The company's firm stance against health misinformation led to the video's removal, underscoring its commitment to reliable information during the ongoing pandemic.

YouTube's reason for removing the video echoed similar concerns, focusing on allegations made against the safety and efficacy of vaccines. A YouTube spokesperson explained, "We removed the video for making claims that vaccines don't reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 and cause other infectious diseases."

These steps were supported by statements from UNAIDS, which has affirmed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe for everyone, including those living with HIV. This refutes the misinformation suggested in Bolsonaro's video.

As of now, Bolsonaro's office has not responded to requests for comments regarding the removal of the video by both social media giants. This is not the first time YouTube has taken action against Bolsonaro's content. The platform previously removed videos promoting hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin as treatments for COVID-19, despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting their efficacy for this purpose.

President Bolsonaro, who once credited hydroxychloroquine for his mild COVID-19 symptoms, has been vocal about his reluctance to get vaccinated. This position has only contributed to the controversy surrounding his views on the pandemic and its treatments.

Further consequence of the video's removal was YouTube's decision to suspend Bolsonaro for seven days, indicating the severity of the breach in their misinformation policies.

Neither Facebook nor YouTube have provided additional comments on the nature or duration of the suspension, maintaining a focus on their commitment to containing the spread of misinformation during a critical time in global health.
