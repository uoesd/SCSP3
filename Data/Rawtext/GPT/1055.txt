Community Mourns and Remembers Gabby Petito at Emotional New York Memorial

HOLBROOK, NY – Family, friends, and supporters came together in Holbrook, New York, to pay tribute to Gabby Petito, whose tragic death has captured the nation's heart. The memorial was held one week after her body was found in Wyoming, marking a somber occasion for reflection and remembrance.

Joseph Petito, Gabby's father, spoke with deep emotion about his daughter, telling those gathered, "Gabby is the most amazing person I've ever met." His words painted a picture of a vibrant and loving young woman whose life was cut tragically short.

Her stepfather, Jim Schmidt, also shared heartfelt memories. "Gabby was always the one bright light in the room, and she made sure everyone was always happy," he said, echoing the sentiments of all who knew her.

In a poignant symbol of their current reality, the Petito family displayed an empty urn during the service. The FBI has yet to release Gabby's remains to the family, adding an additional layer of grief to their mourning process.

Joseph Petito delivered a powerful message to those in attendance, urging them to embrace life fully and to leave any situation that does not make them happy. "If there's a trip you guys want to take, take it now. Do it now while you've got the time," he said, advocating for living life to its fullest in honor of Gabby.

Corissa Ambrose, who knew Gabby, remembered her for her free-spirited and kind-hearted nature. "She had this aura about her that just emanated kindness and adventurous spirit," Ambrose shared, highlighting how Gabby touched the lives of those around her.

In lieu of flowers, the Petito family has requested donations to the Gabby Petito Foundation, established in her honor. The foundation aims to assist in bringing missing children home and supporting their families during such difficult times.

Gabby Petito was reported missing more than two weeks ago, and her death has been ruled a homicide, leaving the community and nation to grapple with the senseless loss of a young life.

In North Port, about 200 people attended a vigil to honor Gabby's memory, demonstrating the wide-reaching impact of her story and the collective mourning process.

Gabby's fiancé, Brian Laundrie, remains a person of interest in her death. A federal arrest warrant has been issued for him, turning the investigation towards understanding the circumstances surrounding Gabby's demise.

The discovery of Gabby Petito's remains in Bridger-Teton National Forest came after a wide-spanning search. Her last social media post dated August 25 served as a haunting reminder of a life celebrated and mourned in its sudden absence.

The community and beyond have rallied together in their grief, showing an outpouring of support for the Petito family. As investigations continue, the memory of Gabby Petito is kept alive through shared stories, tears, and laughter, reflecting a collective desire to honor her life and legacy.

In his closing words at the memorial, Joseph Petito reminded those present of the preciousness of life and the importance of cherishing every moment with loved ones. "Let this be a lesson to all of us, to live with love and peace in our hearts," he implored, "for Gabby, and for each other."

As the sun set on a day of mourning and remembrance, the community left with heavy hearts but also with a renewed sense of purpose. The legacy of Gabby Petito will undoubtedly carry on through the foundation in her name and the collective efforts to ensure no family has to endure a similar loss.

In the face of unspeakable tragedy, the message is clear: to live fully, love deeply, and never take a single moment for granted. Gabby Petito's spirit, characterized by adventure, love, and kindness, will be a guiding light for all who knew her and for those touched by her story around the world.
