Trump's Shadow Looms Large on Social Media Despite Bans

In January, following the Capitol riot, major social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter took unprecedented steps by banning former President Donald J. Trump, effectively silencing his primary channels of communication. Facebook has extended this ban until at least January 2023, with public safety concerns being cited as the primary reason. Despite the blackout, Trump's voice has found a way to echo across the digital landscape, suggesting that the power of his platform endures beyond his direct access to social media.

Analyses reveal that Trump's social media engagement has experienced a significant drop in the number of likes and shares he commanded prior to the ban. However, it's noteworthy that some of Trump's statements after the ban have matched or even exceeded the median engagement levels seen before his suspension. This suggests a complex dynamic at play, where the absence of direct communication does not necessarily equate to a diminished presence.

Trump's ability to reach a broad audience, even in the absence of his social media accounts, can be attributed to the amplification of his messages by other popular accounts and right-leaning platforms. Notably, his critiques of prominent conservatives, such as Senator Mitch McConnell, have garnered widespread attention, being circulated extensively by both left and right-leaning social media accounts.

The spread of Trump's statements was analyzed by the Global Disinformation Index, which classified hundreds of accounts to understand the political leanings and the dissemination of disinformation. This research underscores a shift in the digital influence landscape, where the most engaging content regarding Trump now originates from a multitude of sources rather than his own accounts.

Before the bans, Trump's claims of widespread election fraud garnered significant engagement. These assertions received considerably more attention than similar claims made after the social media companies imposed the restrictions. This change highlights the impact of deplatforming in curtailing the spread of political misinformation and the reach of individuals who propagate harmful narratives.

Emerson Brooking, a Resident Fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, underscores the importance of this shift, "The deplatforming of Trump has underscored the utility and impact of such actions in reducing the spread and impact of political misinformation. It serves as a potent reminder of the influence these platforms wield and their responsibility in curbing the voice of harmful actors."

Now described as a "digital leader-in-exile", Trump continues to exert his influence over the political discourse, albeit indirectly. His statements, though no longer broadcasted from his former digital pulpits, still resonate across the social media landscape, fostered by a network of supporters and amplified by the very platforms that sought to silence him. This paradoxical situation highlights the enduring challenge of managing the spread of political messages in the digital age.
