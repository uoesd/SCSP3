Hollywood's Blazing Hypocrisy: A Call for Real Gun Safety

The tragic on-set shooting involving Alec Baldwin has shed a harsh light on the inadequacies of firearm safety and the disturbing lexicon used inaccurately in the heat of initial reports. Critically, SOFREP, a respected authority on military and defense issues, has pointed out these glaring shortcomings, emphasizing the lack of firearm safety knowledge and the misguided use of actual firearms as "prop guns" in movie productions. This tragic incident forces us to question not only the protocols in place but the rationale behind such risky practices, calling for an urgent overhaul of safety measures in the film industry.

While Hollywood has long been a bedfellow with the firearms industry, glorifying guns in countless box office hits, it ironically fails to enforce the kind of rigorous safety protocols that should accompany such devices. The criticism goes deeper, shedding light on the startling fact that the film's head armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, lacked the necessary special training or licenses typically required for handling firearms. This is a jarring contrast to the stringent measures in place for the safety of animals on movie sets, highlighting an inconsistent approach to safety and responsibility.

The entertainment industry's relationship with firearms is not just about their ubiquitous presence on the silver screen but also about how they are presented. Over the years, we've witnessed an increase in gun violence and the variety of firearms depicted in movies, contributing to both the glamorization and normalization of gun culture. Yet, Hollywood's elite, including figures like Alec Baldwin, vocally champion gun control measures, revealing a stark hypocrisy. They criticize gun ownership and the NRA while relying on firearms to thrill audiences and fatten their wallets.

In light of this, SOFREP makes a compelling suggestion: require that armorers on movie sets be NRA Certified Range Safety Officers. The NRA's prominence in firearms safety is undeniable, offering vital training that benefits not only private gun owners but also law enforcement and military personnel. Such a requirement would not only enhance safety standards but also anchor the industry's practices in a recognized framework of responsible gun handling.

Moreover, the piece argues for the implementation of stricter state requirements and the necessity of special liability insurance for those handling firearms in film productions. This would ensure a higher degree of accountability and safeguard against negligence, creating an environment where gun safety is not just a checkbox but a foundational principle.

It's high time for the entertainment industry to adopt serious safety standards, drawing inspiration from the rigorous protocols in place for animal safety. If Hollywood can mobilize resources and advocacy for the welfare of animals on set, it can surely do the same for human safety, particularly when firearms are involved. This isn't just about rectifying a loophole; it's about aligning the industry's practices with its public stances, embracing a culture of genuine safety and responsibility that transcends the glitz and glamour. Hollywood must reckon with its portrayal and handling of firearms, lest the next tragedy be a matter of when, not if.
