Debunking the Myth: No SEAL Rescue of Children from Ever Given Ship

A story has been circulating online, claiming that U.S. Navy SEALs rescued over a thousand trafficked children from the cargo ship Ever Given, which became notoriously stuck in the Suez Canal in March 2021. This narrative has spread across social media and various websites, weaving elaborate details, including the recovery of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) and implicating high-profile entities such as Walmart and the Clinton Foundation in an international child trafficking ring. Our investigation reveals that these claims are unequivocally false, rooted in conspiracy theories with no basis in reality.

The origin of this baseless story can be traced back to Before It's News, a website notorious for its publication of misleading and outright false content. Despite the sensational nature of the claims made in the article, no credible news publisher or official government entity has confirmed any such rescue operation by Navy SEALs or the discovery of WMDs aboard the Ever Given.

The Ever Given, a massive cargo ship, did indeed run aground in the Suez Canal in March 2021, causing a significant disruption in maritime traffic. This much is true. However, the narrative that unfolded thereafter, claiming a dramatic rescue of trafficked children and the recovery of dangerous weapons, is entirely fabricated.

The false story further alleges that the Ever Given was co-owned by Walmart and the Clinton Foundation, using this fictional ownership stake to involve them in a non-existent child trafficking conspiracy. This element of the tale is also without merit. Neither Walmart nor the Clinton Foundation have any ownership of the Ever Given or any involvement in the events purportedly unfolding on the ship.

Compounding these fabrications, the narrative contends that trafficked children were being ordered through catalogs, similar to items on Wayfair, by pedophiles around the globe. This bizarre claim echoes similar baseless allegations made about the Wayfair online shopping website in July 2020, which were also thoroughly debunked.

Supporting this concocted story, mentions of a non-existent 'telegram' were cited, claiming the U.S. Navy SEALs found both live and dead children in cargo containers on the ship. This detail, like the others before it, is completely unsubstantiated and appears to be a tactic used to lend the narrative an air of credibility where none exists.

It's important to note that similarly unfounded trafficking claims were levied against Wayfair in July 2020, alleging that the company was selling extraordinarily expensive furniture as a front for human trafficking. These allegations were widely debunked after gaining brief traction on social media, yet they seem to have inspired the current false narrative surrounding the Ever Given.

Our investigation into these claims reveals a total lack of credible reporting or evidence to support the dramatic rescue operation, the discovery of WMDs, or any involvement by named corporations or foundations in child trafficking. These stories serve as a stark reminder of the ease with which unfounded rumors can spread in the digital age, often gaining a life of their own despite having no basis in fact.

The implications of such false narratives are not merely confined to the realm of internet gossip. They can have real-world consequences, including diverting attention from legitimate cases of trafficking, wasting law enforcement resources, and unjustly tarnishing the reputations of individuals and organizations implicated in these fabrications.

In conclusion, the claims of U.S. Navy SEALs conducting a dramatic rescue of trafficked children from the Ever Given ship are entirely false. No evidence supports the recovery of WMDs, the involvement of Walmart or the Clinton Foundation in child trafficking, or the existence of a child ordering catalog akin to Wayfair. These allegations are without merit, rooted in conspiracy theories rather than facts. It's crucial to approach such sensational stories with skepticism and to rely on credible sources for information, particularly in an era where misinformation can spread rapidly and unchecked.
