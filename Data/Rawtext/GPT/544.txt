Fallen Hero Honored: Navy Corpsman Elevated to Petty Officer 3rd Class Posthumously

WASHINGTON – In a solemn recognition of bravery and sacrifice, Navy Hospital Corpsman Maxton W. Soviak, who was killed in a devastating Islamic State attack at Kabul's airport during last year's chaotic evacuation operation, has been posthumously promoted to the rank of Petty Officer 3rd Class. The young corpsman was one of 13 U.S. service members who tragically lost their lives on Aug. 26, 2021, in an event that deeply marred the final days of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.

Further honoring his service, Soviak has also been posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and the Fleet Marine Force Corpsman warfare badge, recognizing his contributions and dedication to the U.S. Marine Corps with which he was serving at the time of his death. Soviak was assigned to the 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, based out of Camp Pendleton, California, an assignment that underscores the vital role corpsmen play in supporting marine units on the front lines.

In a statement, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro spoke to Soviak's unwavering commitment and the profound loss felt by the nation. "His dedication to service and sacrifice reflects the very best of our naval force, and his legacy will continue to inspire future generations of sailors and marines," said Del Toro. "The promotion and awards he has received posthumously are a testament to his bravery, his dedication to his colleagues and his love for his country."

The attack at Kabul airport occurred amid the frenzied efforts by U.S. and coalition forces to evacuate over 124,000 people from Afghanistan. The operation, which began in late July, marked the chaotic end to America's longest war, with Taliban forces regaining control of the country.

News of Soviak's posthumous promotion and recognition comes as preparations are made for the return of his remains to the United States. They will be transferred at Dover Air Force Base and are scheduled to arrive at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. Following the arrival, a public procession has been planned to honor Soviak and allow members of the community to pay their respects to a hero who paid the ultimate sacrifice.

Soviak's legacy, marked by his courage and devotion, will endure as a reminder of the costs of freedom and the valor of those who defend it.
