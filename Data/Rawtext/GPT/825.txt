Fact Check: Are Illegal Immigrants Eligible for $1,400 Stimulus Checks?

In the recent debate over the American Rescue Plan's stimulus payments, Senator Ted Cruz proposed an amendment aimed at preventing illegal immigrants from receiving $1,400 checks. Senator Cruz's initiative sparked significant discourse on the eligibility criteria for these payments, drawing counterarguments from his peers, notably Senator Dick Durbin.

Senator Cruz argued that the current provisions allow illegal immigrants — specifically those who overstayed visas but possess Social Security numbers — to benefit from the stimulus checks. "This amendment before us today provides that the stimulus check should not go to illegal aliens in this country," said Cruz during the debate, emphasizing his stance on the need to exclude this group from the financial aid.

However, Senator Durbin challenged Cruz's claims, stating, "The statement of my colleague from Texas is just plain false. False. Let me be clear: undocumented immigrants do not have Social Security numbers, and they do not qualify for stimulus relief checks. Period."

Despite Durbin's assertions, the intricacies of the American Rescue Plan reveal that individuals paying taxes in the U.S. as residents, including those who are non-citizens with Social Security numbers, are indeed eligible for the stimulus payments. This includes individuals who may have overstayed their visas but continue to work and pay taxes in the United States.

It is crucial to understand that unauthorized immigrants, defined as foreign-born non-citizens living in the U.S. without legal residence, represent a broad category. A significant segment within this group includes those who have overstayed their visas. Despite losing their legal status, these individuals often retain their Social Security numbers, potentially rendering them eligible for stimulus checks if they meet the taxpaying criterion.

In 2019, the U.S. reported 676,422 visa overstays, with student visas marking the highest rate of non-compliance. A spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed the legal implications of overstaying a visa, stating, "Overstaying a visa technically renders someone illegal."

However, an aide to Senator Durbin criticized the broad assumption that all visa overstayers possess Social Security numbers eligible for stimulus checks. The aide highlighted that the conditions set for stimulus payment eligibility under the American Rescue Plan also applied to previous packages, emphasizing that the legal framework for these decisions was not unique to the current situation.

Legal permanent residents and non-citizens passing the substantial presence test qualify as legal residents for tax purposes, thereby making them eligible for stimulus payments under the American Rescue Plan. This nuanced eligibility criterion has spurred a complex dialogue on the interaction between immigration status and economic relief measures, underlining the importance of a thorough understanding of the legislation's implications.
