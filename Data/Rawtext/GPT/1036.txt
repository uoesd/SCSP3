Cold Snap in Texas Predicted to Surge Gas Prices in Rockford and Nationwide

ROCKFORD – A cold snap gripping Texas is poised to push gas prices higher, with predictions suggesting a 10 cent to 20 cent increase in Rockford and across the country. This weather anomaly has severely impacted oil production, knocking out 20% of the nation's refining capacity and sending shockwaves through the energy sector.

"All 254 counties in Texas are currently under a winter storm warning," said Patrick DeHaan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at GasBuddy. "The freezing temperatures have led to 11 refineries in Texas and one in Kansas partially shutting down. This is a sizable hit to our refining capabilities."

The increase in gas prices isn't only due to the cold. As COVID-19 travel restrictions start to lift, there has been an uptick in demand, further driving up prices. "Before this event, we were already seeing prices climb due to increased demand," added DeHaan.

In Illinois, the average price of gas has risen to $2.77 per gallon, a significant jump from $2.48 last year. This trend is likely to continue with the annual switch to summer-blend gasoline, which is more expensive but contributes to alleviating air pollution during warmer months.

Residents of Rockford should brace for possibly seeing prices at the pump reach an average of $3 per gallon by Memorial Day. DeHaan mentioned, "Given the current situation, Rockford could very well see such a jump by summer."

The refineries impacted by the cold snap may take up to two weeks to return to full service, further complicating the supply landscape. "It's going to be a tricky couple of weeks for gas prices," DeHaan cautioned. "With refineries down, the supply is obviously affected. And as we move into March and April, demand for gasoline and the prices are likely to continue to rise."

With Texas slowly thawing, the nation watches closely as this unexpected weather event promises to keep fuel prices on an uncertain path in the upcoming months.
