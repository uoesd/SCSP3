Milwaukee Community Marches in Protest Against Rittenhouse Verdict

More than one hundred individuals took to the streets of Milwaukee on Saturday to voice their unrest over the not guilty verdict of Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted of all charges after shooting three people, killing two, during the protests in Kenosha back in 2020. The protest was a direct response to Rittenhouse's acquittal, signaling a profound disagreement with the judicial outcome related to the events that transpired following the police shooting of Jacob Blake.

Mariah Smith, a vocal speaker from the Peoples Revolution, underscored the significance of the verdict, particularly its impact on white allies actively involved in the Black liberation movement. "This verdict is not just about Kyle Rittenhouse, it's about signaling to our white allies that their support in our struggle for justice comes with dire consequences," Smith expressed, indicating a deeper concern over the message the verdict sends.

The rally, orchestrated by the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, culminated at the Federal Courthouse with a series of impassioned speeches. En route, protesters could be heard chanting "No Justice No Peace No Racist Police" and "Black Lives Matter," a stark reminder of the sentiment driving the demonstration.

Omar Flores, co-chair of the alliance, emphasized the march as more than a protest but as a call to action for organized efforts towards civilian control of police. "It is only through our collective action that we can push for significant changes in the way our communities are policed," Flores stated, highlighting the overarching goal of the demonstration.

Retired minister Dale Stohre shared his deep-seated grief over the verdict, emphasizing the weight of its implications. "This decision affects not only those immediately involved but also the wider community, including the town of Kenosha which has suffered enough," Stohre remarked, shedding light on the broader impact of the trial's outcome.

Nathaniel Haack, a resident of Milwaukee, pointed out a concerning consequence of the verdict, suggesting it serves as a deterrent against peaceful protest. "What this verdict tells us is that our right to peacefully protest and demand justice is under threat," Haack mentioned, reflecting on the chilling effects of the judicial decision.

Among the voices raised in opposition to the verdict was Adelana Akindes, a Kenosha resident and participant of Students for a Democratic Society, who criticized the case's portrayal of protesters. "The judge's characterizations of protesters as rioters and looters was not only inaccurate but harmful, overshadowing the true intent of our actions," Akindes argued, challenging the narrative presented during the trial.

Participants concurred that the verdict marked a setback for racial justice and the safety of those who choose to exercise their right to protest, echoing a sentiment of concern and determination to continue the fight for justice.
