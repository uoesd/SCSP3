United Nations Security Council Demands Taliban Guarantee Safe Passage and Reject Terrorism

In a pivotal move, the United Nations Security Council has demanded that the Taliban ensure safe passage for anyone wanting to leave Afghanistan and rigorously prevent the country from becoming a haven for terrorists. The resolution, fervently advocated by leading nations such as the USA, UK, and France, aims to uphold global security in the wake of a tumultuous takeover by the Taliban following the withdrawal of US-led foreign troops.

The resolution came in the immediate aftermath of the tragic attack at Kabul airport by ISKP (Islamic State Khorasan Province), which claimed more than 150 lives and left over 200 individuals injured. This barbaric act has spurred international condemnation and highlighted the imperative of maintaining peace and security in Afghanistan and beyond.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield reflected on the tragic events and the Council's response, stating, "We stand in solidarity with the victims of these horrific attacks. This resolution is a clear message to the Taliban that the international community is watching, and we expect them to honor their commitments for safe passage and counter-terrorism."

Adding to the urgency, the resolution underscores the necessity of providing safe passage for Afghans and foreign nationals at any moment, not just in the current phase of emergency evacuations. The United States, sharing part of its evacuation efforts, announced that over 122,000 people have been airlifted from Afghanistan since July, marking one of the largest airlift operations in history.

Highlighting the humanitarian aspect, the resolution calls for all parties to facilitate the delivery of aid, ensuring safe and unhindered access for humanitarian actors to provide crucial support to the Afghan population.

In a plea for preserving progress, Nathalie Estival-Broadhurst, Deputy Permanent Representative of France, emphasized, "We cannot allow the achievements of the last twenty years to be undone. The protection of human rights, especially for women and girls, must remain a cornerstone of the international community's efforts in Afghanistan."

The United Kingdom's Ambassador Barbara Woodward reiterated the significance of holding the Taliban accountable to their promises, saying, "The eyes of the world are on the Taliban. It is their actions, not their words, that will speak volumes."

However, the resolution faced abstention from Russia, with Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia explaining, "Our abstention reflects our concern that the resolution does not adequately address the fundamental issue of combating international terrorism in Afghanistan."

China's stance, voiced by Ambassador Geng Shuang, highlighted the broader context of the situation, "The chaos we witness today is directly linked to the disorderly withdrawal of foreign troops. It's time for reflection on the part of those responsible for the current scenario."

As the world watches, this resolution from the Security Council aims to hold the Taliban accountable to their commitments, stressing the universal demand for peace, security, and the protection of human rights in Afghanistan.
