Trump's Social Media Presence Plunges by 91% After Bans by Twitter and Facebook

In the aftermath of the January Capitol riot, social media giants Twitter and Facebook took the unprecedented step of banning former President Donald Trump from their platforms, resulting in a dramatic 91% decrease in mentions across social media. The bans were implemented in a bid to prevent further incitement of violence following the attack by Trump supporters seeking to overturn the election results.

Twitter and Facebook's decision to eject Trump from their platforms was a significant move, aimed at stemming the flow of violent rhetoric. Following a careful review, Facebook's Oversight Board upheld the suspension, stating that Trump had violated rules by encouraging violence, effectively keeping him off the platform.

As of now, Trump remains banned from both Twitter and Facebook, with no signs of a return in the foreseeable future. In response to the sustained exclusion, Trump lambasted Facebook's action as a "disgrace" and an "embarrassment to the country." He went on to argue that social media companies ought to face a "political price" for their decisions to censor and suppress.

In an effort to circumvent these bans and maintain a direct line of communication with his base, Trump launched a personal blog. This new platform serves as a means for him to share his thoughts and political statements directly, encouraging followers to distribute his messages across Twitter and Facebook, despite his inability to access these platforms himself.

Prior to this blog, Trump's team had resorted to emails to communicate with subscribers and followers, a method considered less direct and immediate than social media postings.

Amid speculation about Trump's social media future, adviser Jason Miller hinted at a significant development, stating, "We're going to see President Trump returning to social media in probably about two or three months with his own platform." Miller believes this move will "redefine the game," suggesting a pivotal shift in how political figures engage online post-ban.

Trump's efforts to reestablish his online presence underscore the ongoing tension between political figures and the platforms that have become essential for direct public communication. As the situation unfolds, the implications for political discourse and social media policy remain to be seen.
