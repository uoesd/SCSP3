Stimulus Payments Expanded: Biden's American Rescue Plan Reaches More Americans

In a significant move to bolster the economy amidst the ongoing pandemic, President Joe Biden has signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, introducing another round of stimulus checks to Americans, including a broader range of eligible recipients. Notably, this round extends eligibility to non-citizens who pay taxes as residents in the U.S. and possess a valid Social Security number, marking a pivotal expansion of financial relief efforts.

Eligibility now encompasses lawful permanent residents and qualifying resident aliens, casting a wider net of support for many living and working within the United States. This development comes as a beacon of hope for those who contribute to the economy but were previously overlooked in financial relief measures.

However, it's important to note the criteria for eligibility sharply excludes undocumented immigrants and individuals filing taxes with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). This delineation underscores the policy's focus on those with lawful status within the country.

The American Rescue Plan notably deviates from the CARES Act policy by including mixed immigration status families for stimulus checks. This shift recognizes the complex realities of many families living in the U.S. and aims to provide a more inclusive financial support system during these challenging times.

Among those eligible are lawful permanent residents, qualifying resident aliens, participants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), Temporary Protected Status (TPS) individuals, and H1-B visa holders, provided they have a Social Security number. This inclusion reflects a broadened understanding and appreciation of the diverse populations contributing to the U.S. economy.

Conversely, nonresident aliens, individuals affiliated with foreign governments, teachers and trainees on J or Q visas, foreign students, and professional athletes commonly do not qualify for the stimulus payment. These distinctions are based on tax status and residency criteria set forth by the IRS.

U.S. citizens living abroad are not left out of the relief efforts. They remain eligible for a stimulus check, assuming they meet the specified criteria. Payment to these individuals will be facilitated through direct deposit or paper checks, depending on the details on file with the IRS.

For individuals who missed out on the first two rounds of stimulus checks, there's a lifeline available. They can claim the missed amounts through the Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 tax returns. This provision ensures that eligible recipients have an opportunity to receive the financial support they were previously entitled to, further emphasizing the comprehensive approach of the American Rescue Plan to economic recovery.
