Lady Gaga Reveals Iconic Inauguration Dress Was Bulletproof, A Nod to Her Italian-American Roots

In an era where fashion transcends mere aesthetics to embody deeper political and personal statements, Lady Gaga's Schiaparelli Haute Couture dress, worn at President Joe Biden's inauguration, stands as a monumental example. Recently featured in a British Vogue video which showcases 20 of Gaga's most iconic looks, the star herself disclosed a startling detail about the outfit: it was bulletproof. This revelation not only underscores the level of consideration given to her safety in such a visible public appearance but also highlights the profound significance woven into the fabric of the ensemble.

Designed by Maison Schiaparelli, the dress is a testament to Lady Gaga's Italian-American heritage, a personal choice that resonates deeply with the star. "Wearing Schiaparelli was a way to honor my family roots. It was more than just an outfit, it was a statement of where I come from," Gaga expressed. The design caught the eye with its dramatic and elegant silhouette, crowned with a giant gilded brooch in the shape of a dove, symbolizing peace - a poignant emblem for the occasion.

Daniel Roseberry, the creative director of Maison Schiaparelli, described the outfit as "a love letter to America," intended to celebrate not only Gaga's unparalleled artistry but her fervent patriotism as well. "Our aim was to craft an ensemble that mirrored the monumental occasion it was meant for, intertwining Gaga's unique spirit with the hopeful message of a new chapter for the country," Roseberry elaborated. As an American at the helm of a historic French fashion house, his collaboration with Gaga serves as a bridge connecting his personal heritage with his professional realm.

Beyond the inauguration day, Gaga's sartorial choices continued to captivate the public. Before the event, she was seen in a white cape by Givenchy, which drew comparisons to Princess Leia, and for her performance, she donned a fitted navy cashmere jacket paired with a voluminous washed red silk faille skirt. Her hair, styled in a braid adorned with a red flower, subtly echoed her look from the previous day, weaving a thread of continuity through her various appearances. From the bulletproof Schiaparelli gown to the thematic undertones of her wardrobe, Lady Gaga's inauguration attire is more than just fashion; it's a multifaceted narrative of heritage, safety, and peace, told with every stitch and silhouette.
