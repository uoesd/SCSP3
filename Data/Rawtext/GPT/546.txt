KABUL, Afghanistan (WTVG) – In a devastating event that shocked the nation, Max Soviak, a Navy medic from Berlin Heights, Ohio, was among the 13 U.S. service members killed in a bombing at Kabul airport. Soviak, also a 2017 graduate of Edison High School in Milan, Ohio, died in an attack that claimed the lives of more than 170 Afghans, marking a tragic day for both the United States and Afghanistan.

The attack, which has been claimed by ISIS-K, a terrorist organization in Afghanistan, has drawn worldwide condemnation and sorrow. Thomas C. Roth, Superintendent of Edison High School, remembered Soviak as not only a good student but also a well-respected individual among his peers and teachers. "Max was committed to helping those in need, showcasing a level of compassion and bravery that inspired all of us," Roth remarked.

As the news of Soviak's death spread, tributes began to pour in from across the country. The U.S. Navy confirmed the death of a sailor in the Kabul airport attack, extending deepest condolences to the family, though they did not name Soviak directly in their statement.

Ohio Senator Rob Portman expressed his heartbreak over the tragic loss of Soviak, calling him a hero who lost his life while aiding his fellow countrymen and Afghan allies. "It is with a heavy heart that we mourn the loss of Max Soviak," Portman stated. "He embodied the best of us, sacrificing his life to save others in a moment of dire need."

The local community and schools are collectively mourning the loss of Soviak, with many expressing their grief and solidarity during this difficult time. The loss of Soviak is not only a tragedy for his family and community but also a stark reminder of the dangers faced by those serving abroad.
