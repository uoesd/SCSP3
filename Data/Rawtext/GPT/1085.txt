Wisconsin Student Claims Encounter with Brian Laundrie in National Park Amid Gabby Petito Investigation

WYOMING (WBAY) – In a disclosure that may provide a critical timeline to the events leading up to the disappearance of Gabby Petito, University of Wisconsin Oshkosh student, Miranda Baker, has claimed that she and her boyfriend had an encounter with Brian Laundrie in Grand Teton National Park. Laundrie is widely regarded as a person of interest in the concerning case of Gabby Petito, whose body was believed to have been found on September 19.

Sharing her account on TikTok, Baker said she felt compelled to come forward with her information, eventually contacting the authorities to assist with the ongoing investigation into Petito's disappearance. The unexpected meeting, according to Baker, took place on August 29, adding a new layer to the timeline that encompasses the days before and after Petito was last known to be alive.

According to Baker's description of the event, Laundrie offered to pay $200 for a mere 10-mile ride. "He approached us asking for a ride because he needed to go to Jackson, and we were going to Jackson that night," Baker recounted. "So, I said, 'You know what, hop in,' and he hopped in the back of my Jeep."

During the ride, Laundrie told them that he had been camping for several days without his fiancée, Gabby Petito. "He told us he had been camping for multiple days without his fiancée. He did say he had a fiancée and that she was working on their social media page back at their van," Baker expressed.

However, the conversation took an unexpected turn when Baker mentioned their intended destination. "Once I said 'Jackson Hole,' he became agitated. He seemed to get agitated. He said he wanted to get out," she explained. Responding to his urgency, they let Laundrie out near the Jackson Dam in Colter Bay. Baker noted the time was about 6:09 p.m. on August 29, with Laundrie then looking for another ride.

Laundrie's return to his home in North Port, Florida, on September 1 alone, without Petito, has cast a shadow over the events that unfolded. Petito's family filed a missing person report on September 11, eleven days after Baker's alleged encounter with Laundrie, marking a critical phase in the case's timeline. Since then, Laundrie has not provided any information or cooperated with the authorities.

Adding to the chronological events, a domestic violence incident involving Laundrie and Petito was reported on August 12 in Utah. Bodycam footage from the police captured a visibly distressed Petito and Laundrie but resulted in no charges filed against them.

The sequence of such encounters and incidents forms a mosaic of increasingly concerning events that have captured the nation's attention. With Baker's account, authorities may be able to piece together more of Laundrie's movements and activities in the days leading up to and following Petito's disappearance.

The investigation continues to unfold, with law enforcement agencies and the public piecing together available evidence. Baker's decision to share her experience on social media and with authorities has added vital information to the investigation, possibly aiding in uncovering more about the days leading up to Petito's tragic fate.

This case has highlighted the role that social media and individual accounts can play in assisting with investigations, illustrating how digital footprints and personal experiences can contribute to solving complex incidents.

As the search for answers continues, the public remains fixated on the evolving details of the case, hoping for closure for Petito's family and clarity on the circumstances that led to this somber outcome.
