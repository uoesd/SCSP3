Hollywood Shifts Towards Safety: No More Real Guns on Set, Vows Dwayne Johnson

In a significant move prompted by a recent tragedy on the movie set of "Rust", Dwayne Johnson's production company, Seven Bucks Productions, has declared a new safety protocol - the firm resolution to use only rubber prop guns in their future productions. This decision surfaces in the wake of the tragic shooting incident that claimed the life of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and left director Joel Souza injured.

The incident, still under thorough investigation, occurred when Alec Baldwin, working on the set of "Rust," discharged a prop gun he was told was safe, leading to the unfortunate death of Hutchins. Despite the initial classification as a prop, the deadly outcome has sparked a major conversation about safety protocols and the use of real firearms in the entertainment industry. Baldwin, deeply affected by the incident, described it as a "tragic accident," stating, "There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother, and deeply admired colleague of ours."

Dwayne Johnson, reflecting on the incident, expressed his heartfelt sympathies towards Hutchins' family and everyone involved in the "Rust" production. "We lost a life," Johnson said. "My heart goes out to her family and everybody on set. I can't speak for anyone else, but I can tell you, without an absence of clarity here, that any project we do with Seven Bucks Productions - there will not be any real firearms on set."

This bold stance comes ahead of the release of Johnson's new Netflix action film, "Red Notice." It highlights a growing sentiment within the industry to prioritize safety over traditional filmmaking practices. Johnson further emphasized, "It's not the easy decision, but it's the right decision. And it's a decision we made with the full support of everyone in our production company."

Echoing Johnson's commitment to safety, Eric Kripke, the showrunner of Amazon's "The Boys," also pledged to ban real guns on his set and encouraged others to follow suit. "Through collective effort, we can make our sets safer for everyone involved. It's time we did something about this," Kripke stated.

The movement to ban real firearms from production sets could signify a turning point in how the industry approaches safety, potentially preventing future tragedies and reinforcing the collective responsibility toward those who bring stories to life.
