Alec Baldwin's Phone Sought Over Fatal 'Rust' Shooting; Emails Show Gun Selection Talks

In a new turn of events surrounding the tragic shooting on the set of the film 'Rust', actor Alec Baldwin is revealed to have had discussions regarding the choice of firearm with the movie's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, via email prior to the incident that led to the demise of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza. According to an affidavit from Detective Alexandria Hancock, Baldwin expressed a preference for a larger gun during those rehearsals.

Law enforcement has taken further steps by issuing a search warrant aimed at Baldwin's cell phone to conduct a forensic download. The objective is to gather a comprehensive scope of data including all contacts, text messages, social media accounts, and GPS data. The action came after Baldwin indicated his willingness to cooperate with the authorities on the condition that a warrant was issued for his phone.

Aaron Dyer, Baldwin's civil attorney, asserts that the actor has been fully cooperative with the investigation. Dyer stated, "Alec Baldwin has been willingly cooperating with authorities to ascertain the true circumstances behind this tragic accident. We are focused on ensuring that privacy is maintained as the phone contains personal and confidential information that is not related to the investigation."

In an eye-catching interview with ABC News, Baldwin maintained his innocence regarding the physical action that led to the gun discharging, claiming that he did not pull the trigger but rather, the firearm went off as he released the hammer. This version of the events has found corroboration from an unexpected quarter. Lisa Torraco, representing 'Rust' assistant director Dave Halls, confirmed Baldwin's account: "Alec Baldwin did not pull the trigger. My client, Mr. Halls, supports Mr. Baldwin's statement. The gun was fired accidentally."

The incident occurred last year, shocking the film industry and leading to a widespread conversation about safety protocols on movie sets. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was 42 years old at the time of her death.

Detective Alexandria Hancock stated in documents related to the issuance of the search warrant that there is a belief Baldwin's phone contains critical evidence that could shed light on the commission of a crime. "Given the nature of the incident and the direct communications regarding the film production being discussed, we have reason to believe evidence that could be crucial to the investigation resides on Mr. Baldwin's phone," Hancock remarked.

The emails in question, exchanged between Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed, detailed discussions about the selection of the gun and accessories for the film's production. These communications are now part of the ongoing investigation to understand the series of events that led to the tragic shooting.

This case has raised numerous questions about procedures and safety measures on set, particularly regarding the handling of firearms. As the investigation continues, there's a mounting demand for clarity and accountability. The entertainment industry watches closely as the justice system untangles the sequence of events that culminated in a tragedy that has left the community both grieving and fervently seeking changes to prevent such an occurrence in the future.
