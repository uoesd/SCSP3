Pence Extends Olive Branch to Harris in Rare Administration Contact

WASHINGTON (AP) – In a significant deviation from the prevailing post-election atmosphere, Vice President Mike Pence has reached out to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, offering his congratulations and assistance in a move that marks the first known contact between the outgoing Trump administration and the incoming Biden team. This development unfolds amid President Donald Trump's continued refusal to accept the election results, making baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud.

President Trump has notably abstained from the traditional gestures of reconciliation and transition, including reaching out to President-elect Joe Biden or inviting him to the White House, a customary practice aimed at underscoring the peaceful transfer of power. Instead, Trump has been vocally perpetuating claims that the election was stolen from him, claims that have been widely discredited and rejected by courts, including the Supreme Court.

Vice President Pence, however, appears to be taking a different path, increasingly distancing himself from Trump, especially in the wake of the Capitol siege on January 6. Despite pressures to overturn the election results, Pence has upheld the legitimacy of Biden's victory, defending the Electoral College's decision amidst a tumultuous political landscape.

In an act symbolizing a return to traditional political decorum, Pence has made the decision to attend Biden's inauguration on January 20, diverging from Trump, who has decided to skip the event. This decision by Pence is seen as a significant gesture of support for the peaceful transition of power, a fundamental principle of American democracy.

The call between Pence and Harris was described by officials familiar with the conversation as a "good call," with Pence offering his full cooperation and assistance to the Vice President-elect during the transition period. This move by Pence is not only an acknowledgment of the incoming administration but also an affirmation of the longstanding tradition of comity and mutual respect between outgoing and incoming leaders, a tradition President Trump has largely ignored.

Furthermore, Pence has continued to fulfill his ceremonial duties in the final days of his vice presidency. He has made efforts to express his gratitude to the National Guard members stationed around the Capitol, acknowledging their role in protecting the integrity of the inauguration ceremony against potential disruptions.

The interaction between Pence and Harris represents a crucial return to the norms of political civility and bipartisanship, especially at a time when the nation is deeply divided. The call is a beacon of hope for many who value the peaceful and respectful transfer of power as a cornerstone of American democracy.

President-elect Joe Biden has publicly stated that he would be "honored" to have Vice President Pence attend his inauguration, further underscoring the importance of upholding historical precedents and ensuring the continuity of governance. This gesture by Pence, amid the tumultuous ending to Trump's presidency, is viewed as a vital step towards healing and unity for a nation in turmoil.
