IRS Distributes Over 90 Million Stimulus Checks Under Biden's American Rescue Plan

In an unprecedented financial move, the U.S. government, under President Joe Biden's leadership, has sent out more than 90 million coronavirus relief checks to Americans, with millions more in the pipeline. This initiative is part of the sweeping $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan aimed at stabilizing the economy as the nation continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic.

As more individuals eagerly anticipate their stimulus payments, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has implemented a 'Get My Payment' tool on its website. This online application allows users to check the status of their stimulus payment by entering basic information. The tool updates once daily, and the IRS strongly advises against calling for payment information to avoid overwhelming the system.

The third round of Economic Impact Payments is determined based on the information provided in either 2019 or 2020 tax returns. This approach allows for the inclusion of non-filers and those who submitted simplified returns last year in anticipation of the stimulus payment.

For those who received previous stimulus payments via direct deposit, and might not receive it through the same method this time, the payment will be issued either as a check or a prepaid debit card. Subsequently, Social Security and other federal beneficiaries are expected to receive their payments following the same method as their regular benefits.

Each eligible individual stands to receive $1,400, while married couples can receive $2,800, plus an additional $1,400 for each dependent child. However, the full amount of the stimulus payment begins to decrease for individuals earning above $75,000 and couples earning more than $150,000, phasing out entirely at $80,000 for single filers and $160,000 for married couples filing jointly.

In a bid to accommodate the administration of COVID relief payments and address the delays in tax refunds, the IRS has made a significant decision to extend the tax filing deadline from April 15 to May 17. This extension provides taxpayers with additional time to file and sort out their finances amidst these challenging times.

The 'Get My Payment' tool is designed to be user-friendly, requiring only a few essential pieces of information to check payment status. Individuals looking to use the tool will need to provide their Social Security number or tax ID number, date of birth, street address, and ZIP code.

The distribution of over 90 million stimulus checks marks a critical step in the government's efforts to provide financial relief to Americans. With additional payments set to be distributed, the 'Get My Payment' tool stands as a crucial resource for millions looking to find out when they can expect their payment.

This round of payments and the American Rescue Plan as a whole represent a significant federal effort to provide economic relief and stimulate the economy. As the nation continues to face the challenges brought on by the pandemic, these stimulus payments are a welcome support for millions.

To accommodate the new round of stimulus payments, the IRS is working tirelessly to ensure these funds are distributed efficiently. With the 'Get My Payment' tool and extended filing deadline, the IRS aims to streamline the process and make it as smooth as possible for every American entitled to receive these much-needed funds.

In what could be described as a race against time, the IRS and the Biden administration are making all possible efforts to ensure that financial relief reaches Americans promptly. As the nation looks forward to better days, these stimulus payments are seen as a beacon of hope, providing much-needed support during these uncertain times.
