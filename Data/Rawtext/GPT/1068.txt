Long Island Woman Missing Under Mysterious Circumstances While Traveling in Wyoming

BLUE POINT, Long Island (WABC) – A vibrant young woman from Long Island has mysteriously disappeared while on a cross-country trip in Wyoming, leaving her family, friends, and the public desperate for answers. Gabrielle Petito, 22, known as Gabby to those close to her, was traveling with her boyfriend in a white 2012 Ford Transit van, with plans to document their adventurous journey across the United States on YouTube. Their anticipated destination was Portland, Oregon, by October, but now, Gabby's whereabouts remain alarmingly unknown.

Nicole Schmidt, Gabby's mother, has been vocal about her growing concern and distress since her daughter's disappearance. "It's like a nightmare I can't wake up from," Schmidt shared. "All I want is for her to come home safe and sound. It's been an agonizing wait without any news."

Gabby and her boyfriend embarked on their trip in July, aiming to explore the vast landscapes of the U.S. while sharing their experiences online. The couple's online followers were drawn to their adventurous spirit, making their sudden silence on social media alarming to many.

The last known communication from Gabby was a text message received by her mother on August 30. However, specifics about the message's contents have not been disclosed, adding to the mystery surrounding Gabby's disappearance. She was officially reported missing to the Suffolk County Police Department on September 11, after days of excruciating uncertainty for her family.

What is particularly troubling is that while Gabby is missing, her boyfriend has returned, and the white Ford Transit van the couple was traveling in was recovered in Florida. The boyfriend is not missing, but details regarding his involvement or insights into Gabby's disappearance have yet to be clarified.

Described as a white female, approximately 5-foot-5 and 110 pounds, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and several tattoos, Gabby's physical description has been widely circulated in hopes that someone will recognize her.

Both local police and the FBI Tampa Field Office are actively involved in the investigation into Gabby's disappearance. "We are working tirelessly to bring her home," said a spokesperson from the North Port Police Department. "We urge anyone with information to come forward. Every little bit could be crucial."

The North Port Police Department emphasized, "This is a complex and multifaceted investigation that involves multiple law enforcement agencies. Gabby's family and friends deserve answers, and we are committed to doing everything within our power to solve this case."

Nicole Schmidt has made a heartfelt plea to the public: "Please, if you know anything, if you've seen Gabby or have any information about where she might be, don't hesitate. No piece of information is too small or insignificant. Help us bring Gabby back home."

Authorities are encouraging anyone with information regarding Gabrielle Petito's disappearance to contact Crime Stoppers or the North Port Police Department directly. "The smallest detail may help in solving this case," they noted. The community, both local and online, has rallied in support, hoping for Gabrielle's safe return, as the search continues.
