In a heartening update from Hurley Medical Center, 14-year-old Phoebe Arthur, a survivor of the tragic Oxford High School shooting, has been discharged. The young survivor's journey to recovery has been a beacon of strength and resilience for the Oxford community. Phoebe was one of the students injured during the shooting on November 30, which took the lives of four students and injured seven.

Sandy Cunningham, Phoebe's mother, shared an update on her daughter's progress, expressing gratitude for the community's overwhelming support. "Seeing Phoebe make such strides in her recovery fills us with hope. The support from everyone has been incredible, and we can't thank them enough," Cunningham stated.

To assist with the mounting medical and trauma-related expenses, Phoebe's family initiated a GoFundMe page, which has garnered approximately $75,258 of its $100,000 goal. Naomi Ernest, Phoebe's cousin and the organizer of the GoFundMe page, shared updates on Phoebe's recovery, which include significant milestones like sitting up, walking, and laps around the pediatric unit.

"The outpouring of support from across the country has been astounding," Ernest revealed. "The donations and messages of encouragement have not only helped with the financial burden but have also provided Phoebe and our family with much-needed hope during this difficult time."

In response to the Oxford High School tragedy, a total of eight verified GoFundMe pages have been created to support the victims and their families. Among these is a campaign for another survivor, Aiden Watson, who had to miss a chance to join the high school swim team due to the injuries he sustained during the shooting. Aiden's GoFundMe page highlights his recovery journey and the ongoing support needed.
