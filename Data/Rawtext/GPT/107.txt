CNN Faces Backlash Over Chris Cuomo's Interviews with Governor Andrew Cuomo Amid Nursing Home Scandal

NEW YORK (AP) – CNN's decision to allow journalist Chris Cuomo to conduct interviews with his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, has come under intense scrutiny as the governor faces a scandal over the handling of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. The once celebrated prime-time segments, known for their mix of light-hearted banter and discussions of the pandemic, are now viewed unfavorably, raising questions about journalistic integrity and conflicts of interest.

CNN had previously established a policy that prevented Chris Cuomo from interviewing or reporting on his brother, a policy temporarily lifted during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The network's change of heart allowed the Cuomo brothers to engage in several widely-watched interviews last spring. However, these interviews are now criticized for their perceived lack of seriousness given the gravity of New York's COVID-19 crisis, especially in nursing homes.

Critics argue that the familial relationship between Chris Cuomo and the governor created an inherent conflict of interest that made it unlikely for tough, probing questions to be asked. The light-hearted nature of their exchanges is seen as inappropriate given the emerging details of the Cuomo administration's handling of the pandemic, specifically accusations of undercounting COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents to deflect blame from the governor's policies.

The underreporting scandal came to light following a report by New York's attorney general, which found that the Cuomo administration had significantly undercounted the number of COVID-19 deaths among nursing homes. In response, Governor Cuomo has blamed nursing home staff for the virus's spread, a stance that has drawn significant criticism. Further complicating matters, a top aide to the governor admitted in a private conversation that the true death toll was withheld from the public to avoid potential backlash from the Trump administration's Justice Department.

Despite Chris Cuomo's previous interviews with his brother, CNN has since reinstated its ban on him covering or interviewing the governor. The nursing home death scandal has, however, been covered on other CNN programs, with anchors such as Jake Tapper openly criticizing Governor Cuomo's decision-making and accusing his administration of hiding crucial data. Tapper has invited the governor to respond on his show, but to no avail.

Chris Cuomo has defended the significance and entertainment value of his interviews with his brother but has adhered to CNN's current policy of not reporting on the scandal. Meanwhile, other CNN journalists have taken the task of reporting on the unfolding controversy, maintaining a critical stance towards the Cuomo administration's handling of the pandemic and its aftermath.

Roy Gutterman, a media law professor at Syracuse University, commented on the situation, highlighting the ethical challenges it poses. "Journalistically, it's inappropriate to have someone interview their family member in an authoritative, news-related context," Gutterman said. "It blurs the line between journalism and spectacle and erodes trust in the media's ability to hold powerful figures accountable."

As the scandal continues to evolve, the debate over journalistic ethics, conflict of interest, and the role of the media in covering powerful political figures remains at the forefront of discussions within the industry and among the public. CNN's handling of the Cuomo interviews serves as a complex case study in the balance between journalistic integrity and the demands of news entertainment.
