Major Banks in U.S. Begin Delivery of $1,400 Stimulus Checks Amid COVID-19 Economic Hardship

In an effort to ease the financial strain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, major banks in the United States have commenced the delivery of $1,400 stimulus checks this March. These payments are part of the government's initiative to assist households grappling with the economic fallout of the ongoing health crisis.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been at the forefront of this endeavor, having already disbursed over 165 million payments, totaling approximately $388 billion. The latest round of payments, with an official payment date of May 12, underscores the government's commitment to supporting American citizens during these trying times.

Priority has been given to individuals who have filed their 2019 or 2020 tax returns. Additionally, the IRS has meticulously vetted the payment data for government benefit recipients, including those receiving Social Security benefits, to ensure accuracy and efficiency in the distribution of the funds.

In a remarkable move, more than 460,000 "plus-up" payments were dispatched to individuals who were owed more than they initially received, alongside another 500,000 payments to recent tax filers. This adjustment reflects the IRS's dedication to fairness and accuracy in its relief efforts.

Distribution of the new payments was evenly split, with approximately half of them being sent via direct deposit and the remaining half through mail, either as checks or pre-paid debit cards. This dual-method approach aims to expedite the delivery process and accommodate different preferences and circumstances among recipients.

Amid ongoing economic uncertainty, lawmakers are currently debating the possibility of a fourth round of payments. This consideration comes as 38% of Americans report that their household income continues to be negatively impacted by the pandemic, indicating a sustained need for financial assistance.

To help recipients track their $1,400 checks, the IRS has reopened the "Get My Payment" website. The platform offers real-time updates on payment statuses, ranging from processed payments to notices indicating the need for more information. This tool is crucial for ensuring transparency and ease of access to payment information.

However, issues such as unchanged addresses or bank information can pose challenges in the delivery of payments. In response, the IRS has encouraged citizens to file their 2020 tax returns with updated information to facilitate a smoother transaction process.

Notably, recipients should be aware that pre-paid debit cards used for stimulus payments will not be reloaded with new funds. Instead, a new card or an alternative payment method will be issued for subsequent payments, to ensure that all recipients receive their stimulus money without delay.

In cases where the IRS has outdated bank account information, delays are inevitable. However, the agency has assured the public that any returned funds will result in the issuance of a mailed check or pre-paid debit card, thereby guaranteeing that no eligible recipient is left without their deserved stimulus payment.

According to Charlie Wise, head of global research and consulting at TransUnion, "The IRS's efforts to distribute these stimulus payments as swiftly and securely as possible are commendable. Considering the complexity and scale of this operation, the speed of delivery is a testament to the dedication and hard work of all parties involved."

Wise further emphasized the role these payments play in stabilizing the economy, stating, "These stimulus payments are not just lifelines for many American families but are also pivotal in bolstering consumer spending and, by extension, stimulating economic growth. The positive impacts of these payments ripple through the economy, benefitting countless sectors and communities."

As the country continues to navigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the timely distribution of the $1,400 stimulus checks represents a tangible sign of hope and support for millions of Americans. Amid discussions of potential additional rounds of payments, the collective focus remains on recovery and resilience in the face of adversity.
