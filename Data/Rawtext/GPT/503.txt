Over $1.7 Billion in Federal Support for Hurricane Ida Recovery in Louisiana

BATON ROUGE, La. – In a sweeping response to the devastation left by Hurricane Ida, more than $1.7 billion in federal support has been directed to Louisiana's recovery efforts. This significant financial assistance underscores the extensive damage inflicted by the hurricane and the comprehensive response efforts underway to support the affected communities in rebuilding and recovery.

As part of the recovery package, over $889 million in federal grants and more than $816 million in low-interest loans have been distributed to aid the recovery process. These funds represent a crucial lifeline for many in the impacted areas, providing both immediate relief and support for long-term rebuilding efforts.

Furthermore, the National Flood Insurance Program has paid out $297 million in claims to survivors, offering vital financial support to those faced with the daunting task of repairing or rebuilding their homes. This assistance is a key component of the broad spectrum of support available to those affected by Hurricane Ida.

The assistance provided has been comprehensive, including housing support, other needs assistance such as personal property and medical expenses, and U.S. Small Business Administration loans for both individuals and businesses. This multi-faceted approach ensures that both the immediate and ongoing needs of the community are addressed.

Federal housing assistance has been a cornerstone of the recovery efforts, providing rental aid to more than 179,000 homeowners and renters affected by the hurricane. This support has been crucial in offering a stable living situation for those whose homes were damaged or destroyed.

In addition to rental aid, Direct Temporary Housing assistance has been made available in 10 of the most impacted parishes. This program offers various forms of temporary housing to meet the diverse needs of the community, ensuring that those most in need have access to safe and secure housing.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has also contributed significantly to the recovery efforts by installing 33,200 "blue roofs." These temporary roof repairs protect homes from further damage and allow residents to remain in their homes while permanent repairs are made.

Nearly 33,269 individuals have sought assistance through FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers, highlighting the widespread need for support. These centers provide a vital resource for individuals looking for information and assistance in the recovery process.

Disaster Survivor Assistance teams have conducted over 143,544 home visits, further emphasizing the personal touch of the recovery efforts. These teams provide on-the-ground support, helping individuals navigate the sometimes-complex process of accessing federal assistance.

Recognizing the ongoing need for support, the deadline for applying for FEMA assistance has been extended to November 29, 2021. This extension ensures that those affected have ample opportunity to apply for the assistance they need.

Applying for FEMA assistance has been made convenient, with options to apply online or by phone seven days a week. These accessible methods ensure that all those impacted by Hurricane Ida have the opportunity to seek the support they need for recovery.

The recovery from Hurricane Ida is a long-term effort, requiring a coordinated and comprehensive approach. The federal support detailed above provides a solid foundation for these efforts, offering hope and assistance to those working to rebuild their lives and communities.
