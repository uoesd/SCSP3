Tennessee Accelerates COVID-19 Vaccine Eligibility for All Adults

NASHVILLE – Today, Governor Bill Lee announced a significant step forward in Tennessee's fight against COVID-19, with all adults in the state set to become eligible for vaccination by April 5. This move highlights Tennessee's efforts to ensure the health and safety of its residents amidst the global pandemic.

Governor Lee emphasized the importance of this milestone in the state's recovery efforts. "This is a major step forward in our fight against COVID-19," said Governor Lee. "I am proud of the progress we've made and look forward to seeing more Tennesseans getting vaccinated as we work toward returning to our normal lives."

The Tennessee Department of Health has moved up the eligibility timeline to allow Tennesseans aged 55 and over, as well as individuals in Phase 2 of the vaccination plan, to start receiving vaccinations as of March 18. This expansion of eligibility includes crucial workers in several sectors that are vital to the state's economy and the well-being of its residents.

Moreover, effective April 5, the eligibility will extend to all Tennesseans aged 16 and over, surpassing the initial expectations and aligning with the state's goal to make the vaccines available to as many people as quickly and safely as possible.

The announcement also unveils that Phase 3 of the vaccination plan is on the horizon, with congregate living staff and residents, and grocery store workers not previously eligible, now included in the rollout. Direct allocations of vaccines will be channeled to facilities housing those eligible under Phase 3, ensuring an organized and efficient vaccination process.

To date, Tennessee has received a total of 2.9 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and is prepared for an influx of approximately 311,000 doses in the coming week of March 22. The state anticipates an increased supply of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine beginning the week of March 29, promising to further accelerate the vaccination efforts.

Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey provided further insight into the state's progress. "We are thrilled to extend eligibility to all adults ahead of the federal goal of May 1. This is a testament to the hard work of our health departments, partners, and volunteers across the state who have been instrumental in getting us to this point," said Dr. Piercey.

Phase 2 of the vaccination plan spotlights the role of essential workers, acknowledging the contributions of individuals in several key industries not covered in the earlier phases. Through this comprehensive approach, Tennessee aims to protect its workforce while paving the way for economic recovery.

Governor Lee and Commissioner Piercey urge all eligible Tennesseans to take advantage of the vaccination opportunities. Their unified message underscores the importance of each vaccination in moving Tennessee closer to overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic and restoring the vibrancy of every community across the state.
