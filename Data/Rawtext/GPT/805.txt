IRS Distributes "Plus-Up" Stimulus Payments to Americans Affected by Pandemic Income Loss

Washington – In a recent move targeted at helping Americans financially impacted by the pandemic, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has initiated the distribution of additional stimulus cash through "plus-up" payments. This initiative aims to aid individuals who, upon filing their 2020 tax returns, appeared to qualify for more stimulus money than they initially received during the first two rounds of stimulus checks.

Over the past two weeks, the IRS has issued more than 1 million of these supplemental payments, injecting approximately $2.5 billion into the hands of Americans who suffered loss of income in 2020. Since the beginning of the year, over 8 million supplemental payments have been sent out, indicating a significant effort by the federal government to provide targeted financial support.

Furthermore, another set of 900,000 payments were made to individuals, typically low-income, who do not usually file tax returns. However, these individuals took the step this year to file their tax returns, aiming to claim the stimulus money rightfully theirs.

The third round of stimulus payments, authorized earlier in March, was designed to distribute up to $1,400 per person, reaching an estimated 85% of American households. In this round, families were eligible to receive $1,400 for each dependent, including adult dependents over the age of 17. It's important to note that the amount of the payments phases out at higher income levels, ensuring the aid reaches those most in need.

In addition to direct stimulus payments, the latest federal relief package has made significant changes to the child tax credit. Beginning July 15, periodic payments based on either 2019 or 2020 tax returns will start, aimed at offering further financial relief to families.

Eligible parents can expect to receive $3,600 for each child under the age of 6 and $3,000 for each child under the age of 18. At least half of this amount is slated to be paid over the summer, providing critical support during these challenging times.

Moreover, the child tax credit has been revamped to become fully refundable. This particular change makes an additional 20 million children eligible for the benefit, further expanding its reach and impact.

As these "plus-up" payments continue to be distributed in conjunction with the child tax credit adjustments, the federal government's efforts to support American families during the ongoing pandemic remain evident. These measures not only provide immediate financial relief but also set the groundwork for a more robust recovery in the months to come.
