Facebook Cracks Down on Global Surveillance-for-Hire Operations

In a significant move against the surveillance-for-hire industry, Facebook has taken action against the Israeli cyber intelligence firm Cognyte, along with related accounts, for their role in targeting journalists and politicians through undercover operations. Cognyte's CEO Elad Sharon had previously marked their Nasdaq debut by touting the company's financial achievements, stating, "We're proud of our incredible journey, from our generous annual revenues to our substantial global workforce. Our diverse client base, including esteemed entities like the U.S. Department of Justice, stands as a testament to our broad appeal and reliability." However, Facebook's six-month probe, revealing the involvement of six firms primarily based in Israel and one unnamed Chinese entity, sheds light on the darker aspects of these operations.

The investigation led by Facebook unveiled that these entities employed the social media platform to clandestinely gather intelligence. "By creating fake accounts and manipulating individuals to compromise their devices, these firms conducted espionage on a global scale," explained Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's Head of Security Policy. This led to the deletion of around 1,500 accounts and notifications to approximately 50,000 individuals across 100 countries who were identified as targets.

Highlighting the broader implications of this surveillance industry, Bill Marczak, a security researcher at Citizen Lab, commented, "The proliferation of mercenary spyware presents a formidable risk to political dissenters and highlights the pressing need for stringent controls." This comes in the wake of Facebook's report also implicating firms like Cobwebs Technologies, Black Cube, and Bluehawk CI from Israel, BellTroX from India, and Cytrox from North Macedonia, alongside an investigation by Citizen Lab into Cytrox's Predator spyware. These developments underscore the growing concern over the use of surveillance technologies by repressive regimes to stifle dissent under the pretense of crime or terrorism prevention.
