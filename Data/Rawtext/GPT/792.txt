Biden Administration Acts to Ensure 8 Million Americans Receive Missed Stimulus Checks

In a significant move aimed at accelerating financial relief to millions of Americans during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, President Joe Biden has issued an executive order to fast-track the delivery of stimulus checks. This order comes in response to revelations that approximately 8 million eligible recipients did not receive their first $1,200 stimulus checks under the CARES Act.

To address this gap, the President has directed the Treasury Department to reassess and enhance the methods through which stimulus payments are disbursed. One of the core objectives of this directive is to identify and implement more efficient ways to reach those who have been inadvertently left out of the stimulus program.

In pursuit of this goal, the Treasury Department is expected to develop innovative online tools and conduct outreach initiatives designed to help eligible individuals claim their missed payments. These efforts are critical, as they target segments of the population that may have faced barriers to accessing their entitled financial relief.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), under the leadership of Commissioner Chuck Rettig, has already taken steps to bridge the gap by launching an online non-filer tool. This tool is intended to assist those who do not typically file tax returns in claiming their stimulus checks. Despite these efforts, Commissioner Rettig noted, "As of last fall, 8 million eligible people had not used the non-filer portal."

Responding to the administration's proactive measures, Samantha Jacoby, Senior Tax Legal Analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, commended the focus on aiding low-income individuals who were missed in the initial rounds of payments. "Addressing the needs of those who are most vulnerable is a critical step towards equitable recovery from the pandemic," Jacoby stated.

Additionally, the Biden administration is concerned that the number of Americans who have missed out on stimulus payments could be even higher than the currently estimated 8 million. With the new executive order, the mission is clear: to ensure that all Americans entitled to stimulus relief receive it without further delay.

This initiative is part of President Biden's broader efforts to provide comprehensive financial assistance and support to Americans struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By targeting inefficiencies in the distribution of stimulus checks, the administration hopes to fortify the economic standing of vulnerable populations and foster a more inclusive recovery.
