Harry and Meghan Grace Time 100's Most Influential People Cover Alongside Eilish, Spears, and Biles

Sept 15 (Reuters) – Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle have been featured on the cover of Time magazine's 100 most influential people of the year, shining a spotlight on a diverse set of global leaders, innovators, and cultural icons. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are celebrated among a host of honorees including pop sensations Billie Eilish and Britney Spears, and Olympic gymnast Simone Biles.

Time's annual list, known for highlighting individuals making significant impacts across the world, emphasized the couple's growing influence since stepping back from royal duties in 2020. The magazine's editor-in-chief, Edward Felsenthal, stated this year's issue is a testament to those "working to build a better future" amid challenging times.

Harry and Meghan's departure from the UK and royal responsibilities led them to pursue independent charitable work and media production, aiming to use their platform for advocacy on key social issues. Their feature on Time's worldwide cover underscores their prominence in global discussions.

In a heartfelt tribute, Chef Jose Andres, founder of the World Kitchen nonprofit, praised the couple for their compassion and activism, noting, "In a world where everyone has an opinion about people they don't know, the duke and duchess have compassion for the people they don't know. They don't just opine. They run toward the struggle."

The list boasts 54 women, including political leaders like President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump. Each individual selected has made significant contributions to their fields or causes, inspiring change and innovation.

Britney Spears, amid her high-profile conservatorship battle, was recognized for her resilience and strength. Paris Hilton, in her tribute to Spears, expressed admiration for the pop star's enduring spirit, saying, "I admire her joy, her spirit, and the powerful voice she is and has been for others who have suffered abuse."

Emerging talents were also acknowledged, with Megan Thee Stallion celebrating Billie Eilish for her authenticity and advocacy. "Billie is a unique soul who speaks her mind, stands up for herself, and others, and uses her voice responsibly, empowering women everywhere," Megan said.

The Time 100 list serves as a reflection of the current global landscape, highlighting figures who have shaped the world in various ways, whether through arts, politics, sports, or activism. With Harry and Meghan at the forefront, this year's issue emphasizes the importance of compassionate leadership and the potential for influence beyond traditional realms of power.
