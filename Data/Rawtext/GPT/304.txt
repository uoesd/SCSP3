FDA Authorizes New Over-the-Counter COVID-19 Tests for Asymptomatic Screening

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken a significant step forward in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by authorizing several tests for over-the-counter (OTC) use without a prescription. These tests are specifically designed for serial screening of individuals who do not show symptoms of COVID-19. This authorization is a critical development in enabling more widespread screening in various settings, including schools, workplaces, and communities at large.

In addition to the OTC authorizations, the FDA has also expanded access to COVID-19 testing in point-of-care (POC) settings. One of the newly authorized tests can be used without a prescription for serial screening, while another requires a prescription. These flexible options are intended to help communities and organizations implement COVID-19 screening programs more effectively and tailor them to their specific needs.

Dr. Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, emphasized the significance of these authorizations. "Screening testing, especially with the over-the-counter and POC tests authorized today, is an important part of the country's pandemic response—many schools, workplaces, and communities are setting up testing programs to quickly screen for COVID-19. With today's authorization, we are providing more options for accurate and reliable serial screening tests that can be conducted in the comfort of people's homes or in point-of-care settings, enhancing our efforts to find and contain outbreaks of the virus." Shuren reassured the public that these tests meet the FDA's scientific standards for emergency use authorization, reflecting the agency's commitment to supporting the nation's ongoing response to the pandemic.

Throughout the pandemic, the FDA has undertaken numerous steps to facilitate the development and authorization of COVID-19 tests. By working closely with test developers and streamlining regulatory processes, the agency has significantly expanded the arsenal of diagnostic tools available to fight the spread of the virus.

Three tests, in particular, have been highlighted for their authorization for serial screening claims: the Quidel QuickVue test, the Abbott BinaxNOW test (available in multiple configurations), and the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2. These tests had previously been authorized for use in individuals showing symptoms of COVID-19. However, with the new authorization, their use has been extended to include asymptomatic individuals in serial testing programs.

This expansion of testing options is part of the FDA's broader initiative to increase consumer access to COVID-19 testing. By supporting the establishment of comprehensive screening programs, the FDA aims to play a pivotal role in controlling the spread of the virus.

The FDA's actions throughout this public health crisis underscore its broader mandate to safeguard public health by regulating not just drugs and medical devices, but also the nation's food supply and other critical areas. By offering several options for accurate and reliable screening tests, the FDA continues to support public health measures designed to control the spread of COVID-19 and protect communities across the United States.
