Cargo Chaos: The Ever Given Blocks Suez Canal & A Tale of Toy Travels

In a striking development that has captured global attention, the Ever Given, a massive 200,000-tonne cargo ship, finds itself lodged sideways in the Suez Canal, disrupting one of the world's principal trade arteries. Operated by Evergreen Marine Corporation for the benefit of Shoei Kisen, the ship's owner, this maritime mishap has caused a logistical nightmare for shipping companies worldwide.

The Ever Given's current predicament echoes a lesser-known incident involving Evergreen, one that turned into an accidental scientific experiment. In January 1992, a ship operated by Evergreen and owned by Technomar Shipping encountered a fierce storm that cast 28,800 plastic toys into the Pacific Ocean, a whimsical cargo comprising red beavers, blue turtles, green frogs, and classic yellow rubber ducks. The vessel responsible for this accidental discharge was the Ever Laurel, which docked in Tacoma, Washington state, a day later than scheduled from Hong Kong after battling the tumultuous weather.

This peculiar event served as the backdrop for Donovan Hohn's 'Moby-Duck,' an exploration of the true story behind the toys lost at sea and how the ship's identity was pieced together through old shipping schedules. Dubbed "friendly floatees," these floating toys embarked on an unintended journey, aiding oceanographers in tracking currents and understanding global climate dynamics.

Remarkably, these plastic voyagers have traversed over 17,000 miles, making landfall on distant shores far from where their journey began. Their travels have provided unexpected insights into oceanic currents and the robust nature of plastic in marine environments.

Evergreen has since continued its operations, maintaining a vessel named Ever Laurel, albeit a different ship constructed in 2012. This newer Ever Laurel plies the route between the Far East and South America, bearing no resemblance to its predecessor apart from the name.

Cargo ships face numerous challenges at sea, with the incident involving the One Apus in December north of Hawaii serving as a recent reminder. During stormy weather, the One Apus lost hundreds of containers, highlighting the continual risk faced by maritime vessels and the need for enhanced safety measures.

The Ever Given's blockage of the Suez Canal emphasizes the fragility and interconnectedness of global trade routes. As efforts to dislodge the goliath shipping vessel continue, the world watches closely, reminded of the sea's unpredictable nature and the intricate dance of global commerce. Meanwhile, the story of the friendly floatees lingers as a curious footnote, a testament to the serendipitous interactions between human activity and natural forces.
