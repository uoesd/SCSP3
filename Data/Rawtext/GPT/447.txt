Prince Harry Gets Candid About Meghan Markle's Struggle with Bullying Allegations in New Docuseries

In a revealing new docuseries titled 'The Me You Can't See', Prince Harry opens up about a series of highly personal and challenging moments faced by him and his wife, Meghan Markle. The series, which aims to shine a light on mental health issues, includes a poignant discussion about the bullying allegations Meghan faced ahead of their high-profile interview with Oprah Winfrey.

The allegations in question were brought to light in a report by The Times, which claimed that Meghan had faced a bullying complaint from one of her closest advisers during her time in the royal family. The Duchess of Sussex strongly refuted these claims, marking the beginning of what Prince Harry describes as a distressing period for Meghan.

During the docuseries, Prince Harry sheds light on Meghan's reaction to these allegations, recounting instances where she was left "crying into her pillow" due to the relentless media and smear campaigns orchestrated by both the press and 'the firm' - a term often used to refer to the monarchy. This period, according to Harry, was a deeply troubling time for Meghan, who felt vilified and isolated by the onslaught of negative coverage.

Harry didn't just stop at discussing the challenges; he also delved into the solutions that helped him navigate through these tumultuous times. Chief among these was therapy, a step he credits Meghan with encouraging him to take. The Duke of Sussex talked openly about the transformative impact therapy had on his mental health and by extension, his relationship with Meghan.

Reflecting on his journey with therapy, Prince Harry emphasized how it enabled him to confront unresolved issues stemming from his childhood, including the death of his mother, Princess Diana. "Therapy has equipped me to be able to take on anything," he stated, underscoring the crucial role mental health plays in personal wellbeing.

Harry's advocacy for mental health isn't new; however, his vulnerability in sharing his own experiences in 'The Me You Can't See' series places a spotlight on the importance of seeking help and speaking out. By opening up about his struggles and the benefits of therapy, Harry hopes to challenge the stigma surrounding mental health and encourage others to take their well-being seriously.

Since stepping back as working royals in March 2020, Harry and Meghan have built a new life for themselves in Montecito, California, where they reside with their son Archie. The couple has been busy, not only preparing for the arrival of their second child, a girl, but also venturing into new professional territories with deals with Netflix and Spotify, and their charitable work through their Archewell Foundation.

This year marks Harry and Meghan's third wedding anniversary, a milestone that coincides with their growing family and evolving professional life. Their partnership, strengthened by their shared experiences and challenges, continues to flourish as they embark on new initiatives and projects.

Among these projects is 'The Me You Can't See', which is set to premiere on Apple TV+ on May 20 at 9 p.m. ET. The docuseries provides an intimate look into the struggles and triumphs of various individuals, including Prince Harry and Oprah Winfrey, as they navigate the complexities of mental health.

In anticipation of the series' release, a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex stated, "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are committed to raising awareness around mental health challenges and advocating for the importance of emotional well-being. 'The Me You Can't See' is a continuation of their dedication to this cause, aiming to create a conversation that can inspire understanding and action."

This project is not just a reflection of Harry's personal journey but also a testament to his and Meghan's commitment to making mental health a global priority. By sharing their experiences, they hope to contribute to a world where seeking help and discussing mental health openly is not only accepted but encouraged.

As Harry and Meghan continue their work in the spotlight and prepare for the new addition to their family, their dedication to public service and mental health advocacy remains unwavering. Through their actions and projects like 'The Me You Can't See', they aspire to inspire change and foster a more compassionate and understanding society.
