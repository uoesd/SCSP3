Search for Gabby Petito Faces Challenges Without Boyfriend's Cooperation

SALT LAKE CITY – The disappearance of Gabrielle "Gabby" Petito has captured the nation's attention, prompting investigators to piece together the young woman's last known whereabouts based largely on social media activity and witness accounts. FOX 13 News Utah has compiled a timeline of Gabby Petito and her boyfriend Brian Laundrie's travels across Utah, offering insight into their journey before Petito went missing.

In an effort to find Petito, law enforcement officers have turned to her social media accounts, retracing her steps through several of Utah's national parks. The couple's adventure commenced in July, taking them through the serene landscapes of Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, and the mystical waters of Mystic Hot Springs, before continuing to Canyonlands and Arches National Park.

Gabby Petito was known to use the AllTrails app extensively, documenting her hiking and driving routes. These documented trips often coincided with the photos and stories shared on her Instagram profile, giving followers a glimpse into the couple's travels. Remarkably, the last hike Petito recorded on AllTrails was at Mystic Hot Springs on July 24, offering a potential clue to her movements.

The timeline takes a concerning turn on August 12, when the couple encountered law enforcement officers in Moab, an interaction that was notably captured on body cam video. This incident provides a critical piece of the puzzle in understanding the days leading up to Petito's disappearance.

Further adding to the narrative, the last known communication from either Petito or Laundrie came through an Instagram post on August 25, centered around Ogden, Utah. This marked a sudden halt to the otherwise regular updates shared by the couple throughout their journey.

In their desperate search for answers, Gabby Petito's family released an open letter to the Laundrie family, pleading for any information that might lead to her whereabouts. Their calls have been echoed by law enforcement agencies, urging Brian Laundrie to cooperate with the investigation.

The couple reportedly spent their last verified night together at the Fairfield Inn and Suites near the Salt Lake City airport on August 24, before Gabby's communications abruptly stopped.

Amidst growing national interest and concern, there has been a widespread call for anyone with information on Gabrielle Petito's whereabouts to come forward, reporting sightings directly to the FBI. As time passes, the search for Gabby Petito becomes increasingly urgent, with Utah law enforcement experts cautioning that locating her without her boyfriend's cooperation poses an "extremely difficult" challenge.
