Harry and Meghan Show Support for Afghan Refugees at New Jersey Base

In an uplifting encounter, Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, recently visited Task Force Liberty at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, highlighting their unwavering commitment to humanitarian causes. The royal couple dedicated their time to engaging with Afghan refugees, particularly focusing on the women and children who have found a new home in the United States following recent turmoil in Afghanistan.

The base presently accommodates over 10,000 Afghan refugees, making it a significant hub for those seeking safety and a fresh start. During their visit, Harry and Meghan took a keen interest in the daily lives and education of the children at the base. They participated in a classroom session aimed at teaching conversational English, an essential skill for the refugees to adapt and integrate into their new environment.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex seamlessly interacted with the children, employing simple English phrases to communicate effectively. They also showed a willingness to learn, picking up common terms in Dari, the Persian dialect spoken in Afghanistan. This gesture of cultural exchange underscored the importance of mutual respect and understanding in such interactions.

A memorable moment of their visit was when Harry and Meghan led the children in singing "Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes," revealing that it is a favorite song of their son, Archie. This light-hearted activity served not only as a learning tool but also as a moment of joy and laughter for the children, many of whom have experienced significant upheaval in their lives.

The royal couple took the opportunity to express their gratitude to the teachers at the base, acknowledging their hard work and dedication. Harry and Meghan stressed the importance of self-care and mental health, reaffirming their advocacy for mental well-being amidst challenges.
