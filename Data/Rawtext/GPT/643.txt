Texas Gun Store's 'Not Guilty' Sale Following Rittenhouse Acquittal Sparks Debate

CONROE, Texas (KPRC) – In a move that has ignited a mix of reactions from the public, Saddle River Range, a gun store in Texas, announced a 'not guilty' sale in the wake of Kyle Rittenhouse's acquittal. The promotion, sent via text message to customers, offers discounts on firearms, optics, bags, and gun parts, explicitly celebrating the verdict.

The store's owner, Thomas Bolsch, defended the sale, stating, "Our promotion of the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense should not be misconstrued as a celebration of loss of life. We believe in responsible gun ownership and the legal process." Bolsch insists the sale commemorates constitutional rights and the legal system rather than the circumstances of the trial itself.

However, the promotion's explicit reference to the Rittenhouse acquittal has drawn criticism from some quarters. While some customers have expressed support, others are disappointed, viewing the sale as a trivialization of a highly sensitive and divisive situation.

Despite this backlash, Bolsch maintains that the majority of the feedback from his customer base has been overwhelmingly positive. "We stand by our message and the principle behind this promotion," Bolsch affirmed. "It's about the rights enshrined in our Constitution, which we will always support."

Dr. James Dixon, president of the NAACP Houston Branch, weighed in on the controversy, highlighting the need for greater sensitivity in promotional messaging. "In a time when our country is grappling with issues of racial injustice and violence, businesses need to be mindful of the messages they send," Dr. Dixon pointed out.

He also reminded that the context surrounding the Rittenhouse trial was deeply intertwined with protests against racial injustice, stemming from the shooting of Jacob Blake. "This isn't just about a sale. It's about recognizing the broader implications of what that trial represented for many Americans," he added.

Saddle River Range's promotion has undoubtedly sparked a conversation, illustrating the complex intersection between business practices and societal issues, presenting a moment for reflection on how businesses engage with and respond to significant national events.
