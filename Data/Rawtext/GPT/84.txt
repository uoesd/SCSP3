Family Blames Trump for Woman's Death in Capitol Riot

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – In the wake of the violent siege on the U.S. Capitol that shocked the nation and the world, the family of Rosanne Boyland, a Georgia woman who died during the chaos, is pointing the finger of blame squarely at President Donald Trump for inciting the riot and, by extension, her tragic death.

Boyland, a fervent supporter of Trump, traveled to Washington D.C. on January 6th, drawn by the president's calls to his followers to gather and "fight" as Congress was set to certify the election results in favor of President-elect Joe Biden. The events that unfolded turned deadly as Boyland lost her life amidst the turmoil, her cause of death not officially disclosed. Yet, according to a friend who was with her, Boyland was tragically trampled in the frenzied crowd.

Speaking out in the aftermath, Justin Cave, Boyland's brother-in-law, did not mince words in assigning blame. "I hold Donald Trump personally responsible for the death of my sister-in-law," he stated, reflecting the anger and grief felt by Boyland's family.

The tragedy has led Cave to further criticize the president's role in the events of January 6th, supporting the rallying call among many for Trump's immediate removal from office. "It is my firm belief that the president's rhetoric and actions have gone too far," Cave said, expressing his support for invoking the 25th Amendment as a means to remove Trump from office.

As the family mourns, a White House spokesman has declined to comment on Boyland's death specifically, amid mounting outcry over the president's incitement and the violent actions of his supporters.

The riot at the Capitol, fueled by Trump's unfounded claims of election fraud and his encouragement of confrontation, has led to widespread condemnation and calls for accountability. Democratic leaders, alongside some Republicans, are advocating for Trump's removal, whether through the 25th Amendment or impeachment proceedings.

Boyland was among four civilians who lost their lives during the chaotic scenes in and around the Capitol. Ashli Babbitt, another ardent Trump supporter, was fatally shot by Capitol Police as she attempted to breach a barricaded door inside the building. Two men also died from medical emergencies during the riot, their names and details of their deaths providing a grim tally of the day's fallout.

The violence also claimed the life of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who succumbed to injuries sustained while clashing with the insurrectionists, adding to the day's grim legacy.

Justin Winchell, a friend who witnessed Boyland's distressing final moments, recounted their experience amidst the chaos. "We were there to support our president, and it turned into a day of horror," he said. Winchell's account underlines the stark reality that the day's events, driven by unfounded claims and vitriolic rhetoric, resulted in unnecessary loss of life and lasting trauma for many involved.

As the nation reckons with the fallout of the Capitol siege, the voices of Boyland's family and friends add to the growing chorus of those seeking accountability and change in the wake of such an unprecedented assault on democracy.
