A New Chapter: Biden and Harris Usher in a New Era Amid Security and Pandemic

Washington CNN – In an inauguration like no other, President Joe Biden took the oath of office on Wednesday, ushering in a new era of leadership under unprecedented conditions. The ceremony, marked by heightened security following the Capitol riot and rigid COVID-19 precautions, brought together a nation in transition. Notably absent was outgoing President Donald Trump, making him the first incumbent president to skip his successor's inauguration in over 150 years.

Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, left the White House for the final time of his presidency on Wednesday morning. In remarks made during a farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews, he said, "Being your president has been a great honor." His departure from Washington concluded a tumultuous term marked by deep national divisions.

At Joint Base Andrews, Trump, surrounded by a tight-knit crowd of supporters and family members, expressed his gratitude. "I want to thank my family, my friends, and my staff for being with me every step of the way," he said. He also extended a vague wish of fortune to the new administration, stating, "I wish the next administration great luck and great success." Trump refrained from mentioning President Joe Biden by name, continuing his trend of minimal acknowledgment of the election results.

Meanwhile, in a spirit of unity and bipartisanship, President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, along with their families, attended morning services at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle. They were joined by leaders from both sides of the congressional aisle, signaling a potential shift toward collaboration in governing.

Vice President Kamala Harris made history as she took her oath of office, shattering several glass ceilings to become the first female vice president, as well as the first Black and South Asian American to hold the position. "While I may be the first woman in this office, I won't be the last," stated Harris, emphasizing the groundbreaking nature of her vice presidency.

In a solemn ceremony on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol, Chief Justice John Roberts administered the presidential oath to Biden. Holding a family Bible, Biden pledged, "I will be a president for all Americans," committing to serve those who did not vote for him with as much zeal as those who did.

The inauguration ceremony was buoyed by star-studded performances, featuring Lady Gaga singing the national anthem, Jennifer Lopez presenting a medley of American musical selections, country star Garth Brooks leading a rendition of "Amazing Grace," and young poet Amanda Gorman reciting her poem "The Hill We Climb."

Shortly after taking office, President Biden made his way to the Oval Office to sign his first presidential documents, including an Inauguration Day Proclamation and a slew of nominations for his Cabinet and appointments. These actions mark the commencement of Biden's ambitious agenda to tackle the nation's pressing challenges.

In a powerful display of unity, President Biden and Vice President Harris, accompanied by former presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama, participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery. This act of remembrance and respect symbolized their commitment to bridging the nation's divides.

President Biden wasted no time in beginning to dismantle his predecessor's legacy, signing over a dozen executive actions on his first day in office. These actions targeted a range of policy areas from pandemic response to environmental protection. "There's no time to waste when it comes to tackling the crises we face," Biden said, underscoring the urgency of his early moves.

In the evening, President Biden addressed White House staff, setting the tone for his administration. He emphasized respect and dignity for all, stating, "If you work with me, and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect ... I will fire you on the spot." This stark departure from the previous administration's tone highlighted Biden's commitment to restoring decorum and professionalism to the White House.

Melania Trump, in her farewell message, said, "Being your first lady was my greatest honor. Thank you for your love and support. You will be in my thoughts and prayers." Her words offered a closing note to the Trump presidency, signaling the end of an era.

As the Biden administration begins its work, the nation watches with hopeful anticipation for a new chapter in American democracy. With challenges ahead and history being made, the world awaits the impact of President Biden and Vice President Harris's leadership on the United States and beyond.
