Vice President Harris Addresses U.N. on Pandemic Preparedness

WASHINGTON – In a virtual address to members of the United Nations on Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized the urgent need for global leaders to collaborate in drafting comprehensive plans to tackle future pandemics. This marks Harris' second engagement with a U.N. body since her inauguration in January and comes at a crucial time as the United States makes significant strides in its vaccination efforts, while many countries around the world grapple with vaccine shortages.

Harris' speech, a shared effort with the U.N. permanent representatives of Argentina, Japan, Norway, and South Africa, underscored the essential focus areas for a global pandemic response plan that include enhancing the accessibility of health systems, investing in scientific research, bolstering healthcare workforces, and expanding manufacturing capabilities for vaccines and protective gear. "As we start to imagine what a post-COVID world looks like, it is crucial we lay the groundwork now for a robust, equitable response to future health crises," Harris stated.

Amid the Biden administration's approach to its first 100 days in office, President Joe Biden is poised to review the administration's pandemic response victories in an upcoming address to Congress. The Vice President's speech precedes this milestone, serving as a critical reminder of the lessons learned from the ongoing pandemic and the unparalleled necessity for innovation in our approach to global health crises.

Echoing Harris' call for heightened readiness was U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, who also took the virtual stage, stressing the need for establishing an effective "future pandemic preparedness architecture." Thomas-Greenfield candidly expressed the global community's shortcoming, saying, "The world barely withstood this pandemic," to underscore the grave importance of being better equipped for similar challenges ahead.

As the United States continues with its vaccination campaign, Vice President Harris and U.N. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield's contributions to the global dialogue on pandemic preparedness highlight a proactive move towards fostering a unified and resilient international community ready to face any future health emergencies.
