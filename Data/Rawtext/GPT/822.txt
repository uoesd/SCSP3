Stimulus Checks to Prisoners: A Bipartisan Issue Over Time

In the midst of the economic turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, various stimulus packages have been passed to mitigate the effects on American citizens. Among the recipients of these stimulus checks have been prisoners, a fact that has sparked debate and controversy. This article examines the factual basis of assertions made about stimulus checks to prisoners, particularly in the context of recent legislation.

Both Democrats and Republicans have, at different times, supported stimulus bills that included payments to prisoners. This bipartisan history is crucial in understanding the current discourse around stimulus checks and their eligibility criteria. The eligibility for these payments is broadly defined, requiring individuals to have citizenship or legal residency, along with either a tax return filing or the completion of an IRS form to receive the funds.

The most recent controversy arose when Democrats opposed a Republican amendment that sought to bar prisoners from receiving $1,400 stimulus checks. The argument from the Democratic side was primarily focused on the impact that excluding prisoners would have on their families. Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) were at the forefront of proposing the amendment, which ultimately failed on a party-line vote.

Senator Cotton criticized the decision, stating, "Prisoners haven't lost their jobs due to the pandemic. There's no reason they should get checks." This highlights the crux of the Republican argument against including prisoners in the stimulus package.

Conversely, Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) provided a counterargument, emphasizing the adverse consequences that blocking stimulus checks to prisoners could have, especially on children and communities of color. Durbin's stance points to a broader consideration of the societal impacts of such financial measures.

The debate over providing stimulus checks to prisoners is not new. Previous stimulus checks during the administration of President Donald Trump were also available to prisoners. This continuity underscores the broad nature of the stimulus packages' eligibility criteria, which did not specifically exclude incarcerated individuals.

James Arnold, Press Secretary for Senator Tom Cotton, mentioned that the issue with prisoners receiving checks under the CARES Act was 'unanticipated' and that corrections could not be made in time for December's stimulus bill. This admission points to the complexity and urgency with which previous stimulus legislation was drafted and passed, leading to unintended outcomes like the disbursement of checks to prisoners.

Republicans, despite having earlier opportunities to address this issue in past legislation, did not make amendments to exclude prisoners from receiving stimulus payments. This historical context brings to light the bipartisan nature of the oversight.

Given the evidence, the claim that Democrats voted to give stimulus checks to prisoners is rated as 'Mostly True'. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that Republicans also supported measures in the past that allowed for prisoners to receive stimulus payments. This fact-check aims to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the issue, illustrating the nuanced positions and historical precedents on this matter.
