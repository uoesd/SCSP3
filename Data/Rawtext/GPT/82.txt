Capitol Riot Fallout Hits Small Pennsylvania Town

KANE, Pa. (AP) – In the tranquility of Kane, Pennsylvania, a town ensconced in the lush forests of the Allegheny National Forest, the aftershocks of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot resonate, revealing deep partisan fissures that mirror the national political divide. Amidst this tumultuous backdrop, Pauline Bauer, a local restaurant owner, has found herself at the center of a controversy following her participation in the event that has inflamed tensions within this small community.

Bauer, who owns Bob's Trading Post, and her longtime friend William Blauser Jr., a fellow Kane resident, are among the hundreds charged for their roles in storming the U.S. Capitol. Their actions, particularly Bauer's recorded confrontation with police, shouting demands to bring out then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to be hanged, has ignited partisan bickering in Kane.

Despite the national and local uproar over her actions, Bauer insists that the controversy has neither damaged her friendships nor her business, which continues to enjoy the patronage of regular customers. "My stance has done nothing but strengthen my resolve and the support of those around me," Bauer stated.

The division seen in Kane is reflective of broader political splits pervasive across the United States, with opinions on the Capitol riot and its implications for democracy often falling sharply along party lines. Video evidence has been instrumental in the arrest of Bauer and Blauser in May, showing them actively participating in the Capitol breach.

Kane, a town that fervently supported Donald Trump in the 2020 election, remains adorned with pro-Trump paraphernalia, signifying unwavering support for the former president. The political atmosphere is charged, with residents like Joe Lanich, owner of The Laughing Owl Press Co., expressing concern over the deep divisions. "It's not just differing opinions anymore. It's a chasm that's hard to bridge," Lanich commented.

In the wake of COVID-19 lockdown measures, Bauer became a vocal critic, aligning with ideologies akin to the sovereign citizens movement, which challenges the legitimacy of government authority. This stance has only galvanized her convictions following the events of Jan. 6.

Blauser, despite advice to distance himself from Bauer, remains a steadfast friend and ally. "She's been there for me through thick and thin. Our friendship won't be undone by this," Blauser professed.

Glenn Robinson, a local resident, reflects on the community's response, noting a palpable tension. "You can feel it in the air. People are wary, choosing sides. It's not the Kane I grew up in," he said.

Mayor Brandy Schimp weighed in on the situation, emphasizing the need for unity and understanding. "As mayor, it's disheartening to see our town divided. We need to find common ground and remember what binds us as a community," Schimp urged.

The legal proceedings for those charged in connection with the Capitol riot continue to unfold, with a number of defendants already pleading guilty or receiving sentences. The cases of Bauer and Blauser remain pending, casting a long shadow over their lives and the community of Kane.

Residents find themselves caught in a dilemma, navigating personal relationships and communal ties in an increasingly polarized environment. As Kane grapples with the ramifications of the Capitol riot, the story of Bauer and Blauser serves as a microcosm of the challenges facing the nation at large—battling ideological divides while striving to maintain a sense of community cohesion.

As the legal process continues, the community of Kane watches closely, aware that the outcomes may have lasting implications for their town and the nation. The ultimate hope, as voiced by citizens like Lanich, Robinson, and Mayor Schimp, is for reconciliation and a path forward that mends the divides exacerbated by the events of Jan. 6.

In a town where political allegiances run deep, the story of Pauline Bauer and William Blauser Jr. is a stark reminder of the enduring impact of national discord on small communities across America. As Kane navigates its way through these turbulent waters, the resolve and unity of its residents will be tested, perhaps now more than ever.
