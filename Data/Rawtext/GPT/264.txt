World Health Organization Designates Omicron a Variant of Concern: Urgent Global Response Needed

Geneva, Switzerland - The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially designated the B.1.1.529 variant, now known as Omicron, as a variant of concern on 26 November 2021. This classification follows the variant's identification and the acknowledgment of its numerous mutations, which could potentially influence both its transmissibility and the severity of COVID-19 infections it causes.

The emergence of Omicron is causing concern worldwide due to its extensive array of mutations. These genomic changes may enable the variant to spread more rapidly than earlier strains of the virus and could also affect the severity of the disease outcomes in infected individuals. Despite this, it is vital to underscore that much is still unknown about Omicron. Comparative analyses are underway to ascertain if it is indeed more transmissible or leads to more severe disease compared to other variants, such as Delta.

Initial findings also indicate a potential for an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron, suggesting that those who have recovered from COVID-19 could be susceptible to contracting the virus again from this new variant. This heightened risk of reinfection underpins the urgency in understanding and responding to Omicron.

Amid these developments, WHO reassures the public that current COVID-19 vaccines remain an indispensable tool in reducing the risk of severe disease and death. These vaccines, which have demonstrated effectiveness against variants like Delta, continue to play a pivotal role in the global effort to combat the pandemic.

In terms of diagnostic capabilities, WHO confirms that PCR tests continue to effectively detect the Omicron variant. Nevertheless, the impact of Omicron on other forms of COVID-19 tests and the efficacy of existing treatments are still under investigation. WHO is spearheading global research initiatives to fill these knowledge gaps and to better comprehend the full implications of the Omicron variant.

As part of a coordinated international response, WHO is urging countries to enhance their surveillance activities, to rigorously share sequencing data, to promptly report Omicron cases, and to undertake detailed epidemiological and laboratory investigations. This collective effort is crucial for building a comprehensive understanding of Omicron's transmissibility, severity, and potential impacts on vaccine efficacy and treatment protocols.

Furthermore, WHO emphasizes the critical need for countries to address disparities in access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Equitable distribution remains a cornerstone in the global strategy to mitigate the pandemic's impact, alongside the implementation of effective public health measures.

Individuals are also reminded to continue adhering to proven preventive measures, including maintaining physical distance from others, wearing masks appropriately, and getting vaccinated. These actions, in conjunction with widespread vaccination and global collaboration, represent humanity's best defense against COVID-19 and its variants, including Omicron.

As the situation evolves, WHO commits to keeping the global community informed and to providing guidance based on the latest scientific evidence. It is only through solidarity, vigilance, and a shared commitment to public health that we can navigate the challenges posed by Omicron and move closer to ending the pandemic.
