Schools on High Alert: Threat Note and Gun Found in Madison High Schools

MADISON, Wis. – Memorial High School in Madison, Wisconsin, was thrust into the spotlight when a note referencing the Oxford High School shooting was discovered on a bathroom floor Tuesday afternoon. The unsettling note prompted immediate action from school officials and has since sparked a broader conversation on school safety and the rising trend of copycat threats.

Matt Hendrickson, Principal of Memorial High School, promptly addressed the situation, ensuring that steps were taken to assess and mitigate any potential risks. "Upon discovery of the note, we acted swiftly to ensure the safety of our students and staff," Hendrickson stated. "We have closely cooperated with the Madison Police Department and the Central Office of School Safety to thoroughly investigate this matter."

The Madison Metropolitan School District echoed Hendrickson's assurances, emphasizing that there is no ongoing security or safety risk to students or staff at Memorial High School. Despite the immediate concern, school officials are confident in the measures taken to protect the school community.

An investigation into the note is currently underway, with the Madison Police Department and the Central Office of School Safety at the helm. Authorities are examining the note's contents and origins in a bid to trace any potential threats to their source.

While the investigation continues, Hendrickson and the school district are encouraging anyone with pertinent information to come forward. "Maintaining a safe environment is our top priority. We urge our school community to share any information that could assist in keeping our school safe," Hendrickson appealed.

In a related incident on the same day, an 18-year-old student at La Follette High School, also in Madison, was arrested for having a loaded gun inside the school premises. The student, identified as Marquan T. Webb, is now facing several charges, including possession of a stolen firearm.

The loaded gun found in Webb's possession had been reported stolen out of Cottage Grove in September. Authorities have not indicated a direct connection between the two incidents, but the proximity in timing has heightened concerns among parents and educators.

Fortunately, there were no injuries reported in either case. The quick response by school staff and law enforcement officials ensured that both situations were contained without harm to students or staff.

The discovery of the threatening note at Memorial High School and the arrest at La Follette High School come amidst a worrisome trend of similar incidents across the country. Following the tragic Oxford High School shooting, more than a dozen school districts in the Detroit area have been forced to cancel classes due to copycat threats.

These incidents serve as a stark reminder of the importance of vigilance and communication within our school communities. As investigations continue, the Madison Metropolitan School District and local law enforcement agencies are working together to keep schools safe and prevent future threats.
