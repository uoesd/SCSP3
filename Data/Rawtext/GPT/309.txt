Ever Given Resumes Voyage after Suez Canal Blockage, Settlement Reached

ISMAILIA, Egypt, July 7 (Reuters) – The Ever Given, a colossal container ship that blocked the Suez Canal for nearly a week in March, has resumed its journey, leaving behind a saga that clogged one of the world's most vital maritime channels and disrupted global trade. The vessel sailed away from the Suez Canal 106 days after it became lodged, marking the end of an impasse that held the shipping world in suspense.

The ship, loaded with about 18,300 containers, embarked on its journey north across the Great Bitter Lake, where it had been anchored since being refloated on March 29, following the signing of a compensation settlement between the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) and the ship's representatives. This agreement paved the way for the Ever Given's release, ending a prolonged negotiation over damages.

A hull inspection was scheduled for the ship before it could sail to its next port, ensuring its seaworthiness after the prolonged standoff. The Ever Given had been held under court order, with the SCA pressing for compensation from the ship's owner and insurers for the incident that threw global supply chains into chaos.

An undisclosed settlement was reached, with some compensation payments agreed to be made this month. Khalid Abubakr, a lawyer for the Suez Canal Authority, emphasized the desire to keep the terms of the agreement confidential to respect all parties involved.

The importance of the Suez Canal to global trade cannot be overstated, with about 15% of world shipping traffic transiting through this narrow waterway. The blockage highlighted the canal's strategic significance and underscored the vulnerability of global supply chains to such unexpected disruptions.

In response to the incident, the SCA has initiated efforts to widen and deepen the southernmost section of the canal and extend a second lane, aiming to prevent future blockages and enhance the canal's capability to handle large vessels under various conditions.

Despite the upheaval, the SCA has announced that rules for ships transiting the canal in difficult weather conditions will remain unchanged, asserting confidence in the canal's ability to manage maritime traffic effectively.

Tarek Alzeki, the captain of a tug boat involved in the refloating operation, described the Ever Given's departure as a relief, marking the end of a challenging period for the SCA and all those involved in the efforts to dislodge the vessel.

R P Veetil, General Secretary of the Sailors Union of India, expressed solidarity with the Ever Given's crew, who faced uncertainty and pressure throughout the ordeal. "It's a monumental relief for the crew and their families. The global maritime community has keenly watched their plight, and we hope lessons are learned to prevent such incidents in the future," Veetil said.

Yukito Higaki, president of Imabari Shipbuilding, a subsidiary of Shoei Kisen which owns the Ever Given, thanked all parties for their cooperation in resolving the situation. "We are deeply appreciative of the efforts by the Suez Canal Authority and all individuals who worked tirelessly to refloat the Ever Given and subsequently reach a fair settlement," Higaki noted.

Guy Platten, Secretary General of the International Chamber of Shipping, highlighted the incident's implications on global trade. "The Ever Given blockage was a wake-up call to the shipping industry and governments worldwide. It accentuated the intricate links and vulnerabilities within our global supply chains," Platten stated.

SCA Chairman Osama Rabie reflected on the resolution of the crisis, asserting the authority's commitment to maintaining the flow of global trade through the canal. "The Suez Canal has always been a symbol of connectivity and resilience. The Ever Given incident tested our capabilities, and we have emerged stronger, prepared to implement measures that will safeguard this vital waterway's future," Rabie concluded.

As the Ever Given continues its journey, the shipping community and global trade stakeholders will undoubtedly scrutinize the lessons learned from this incident. The focus now shifts to enhancing the safety and efficiency of canal operations and ensuring that the Suez Canal remains a reliable route for international trade.
