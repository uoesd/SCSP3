US Announces Final Withdrawal from Afghanistan, Ending Two Decades of Military Engagement

The US, leading a coalition force, initiated a series of bombings against Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities across Afghanistan, targeting strategic locations in Kabul, Kandahar, and Jalalabad. This action marked the beginning of a prolonged engagement in the region, aiming to dismantle the Taliban's stronghold, which remained steadfast even after the Soviet occupation and subsequent civil war. Despite the coalition's efforts, the Taliban refused to surrender Osama Bin Laden, leading to the destruction of their defense infrastructure.

In the wake of military operations, Afghanistan saw a significant political transition with the establishment of a new constitution. This led to the first presidential elections in October 2004, paving the way for a democratic framework. The NATO-led combat operations concluded, shifting the focus towards training and supporting Afghan security forces, a testament to the ongoing international involvement in the country's stabilisation efforts.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani revealed the cost of the conflict on the country's security personnel, stating, "Over 45,000 members of our security forces have made the ultimate sacrifice since 2014." This figure underscores the heavy toll the prolonged conflict has exacted on Afghanistan.

In a significant development, US President Joe Biden announced, "All US troops will withdraw from Afghanistan by 11 September 2021," marking an end to America's longest war. This timeline encapsulates the key moments from the initial airstrikes to the full withdrawal of US forces, highlighting the extensive foreign military presence in Afghanistan.

This overview not only underscores the political and military transitions that Afghanistan has undergone over nearly two decades but also signifies a major shift in strategy with the impending troop withdrawal. President Biden's announcement is seen as a milestone toward ending a chapter marked with enduring conflicts and the beginning of a new era for Afghanistan's sovereignty and self-reliance.
