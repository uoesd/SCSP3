Gabby Petito's Cause of Death Revealed as Investigation Continues Into Fiancé's Whereabouts

The tragic case of Gabby Petito, a name now known nationwide due to the grim circumstances surrounding her disappearance and death, has taken a somber turn. Teton County Coroner Dr. Brent Blue announced that Petito's cause of death was strangulation. The young woman's remains were found at a remote campground in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, where they were likely left for 3 to 4 weeks prior to their discovery.

Dr. Blue specified during a press conference, "The cause of death was strangulation and the manner of death was homicide." He clarified that while the exact time of Petito's death could not be pinpointed, extensive tests including a full-body CAT scan and toxicology reports were conducted before reaching the conclusion about her cause of death.

As investigators continue to piece together the timeline of Petito's final days, attention has turned more sharply towards Brian Laundrie, Petito's fiancé, who has been missing for weeks. Laundrie, who is considered a person of interest in the case, remains at large, with his whereabouts unknown.

Petito was not pregnant at the time of her death, an aspect of the case that had been subject to speculation. Dr. Blue clarified this detail, quelling rumors and conjecture that had circulated online.

In the wake of the announcement, Joe Petito and Jim Schmidt, Gabby's father and stepfather, respectively, have expressed their belief that Laundrie is still alive and deliberately evading law enforcement. Joe Petito remarked, "He's a coward. Hiding does nothing." The sentiment was echoed by Schmidt who called for justice for Gabby, indicating the family's enduring agony and quest for answers.

Amidst the ongoing investigation, the city of North Port has announced plans for a permanent memorial for Gabby Petito. The iteration will replace a makeshift memorial that had sprung up, with a steel bench dedicated in her memory, signifying the impact of her life and tragic end.

Steven Bertolino, attorney for the Laundrie family, stated, "Gabby Petito's death at such a young age is a tragedy." He continued by reiterating that while Brain Laundrie is currently a person of interest in her death, the young man's own whereabouts and well-being are currently unknown.

As the manhunt for Brian Laundrie intensifies, authorities have noted the participation of Laundrie's father in the search. Officials urge anyone with information about Laundrie's whereabouts to come forward, stressing the importance of public assistance in the ongoing investigation.

The tragic case of Gabby Petito has captivated the nation, not only for its initial mystery but for the heart-wrenching developments that have since unfolded. As the search for answers continues, the hope for justice for Gabby remains at the forefront of many minds.
