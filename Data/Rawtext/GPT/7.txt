Nationwide Alert: FBI Warns of Armed Protests as Presidential Inauguration Approaches

The FBI has issued a stark warning about the possibility of armed protests across all 50 states and the US capital in the days leading up to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20. State officials are bracing for potentially violent demonstrations in support of outgoing President Donald Trump.

As tensions escalate, National Guard forces have been deployed in several states, including California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Florida, to bolster security. The measures come in response to the FBI's warnings of potential violent protests at all 50 state capitol buildings starting Saturday and lasting through Biden's inauguration.

Among the incidents heightening concerns was the recent arrest of Wesley Allen Beeler at a security checkpoint near the US Capitol. Beeler was found with a loaded handgun and over 500 rounds of ammunition. Despite the alarming discovery, Beeler claimed it was just "an honest mistake," explaining that he was a private security guard who had gotten lost.

"I did not mean to bring my firearm to Washington, D.C.," Beeler stated. "I got turned around near the Capitol area, and it was an honest mistake."

In anticipation of further unrest, the anti-government "Boogaloo" movement has announced plans to hold rallies in all 50 states on Sunday. Governments across the nation are taking extensive security measures, such as closing the Texas Capitol and erecting a fence around the Michigan Capitol.

Steve McCraw, Department of Public Safety Director in Texas, emphasized the seriousness of the threat, stating, "We are prepared to ensure the safety and security of our state Capitol, our staff, and visitors."

Michigan State Police Director, Joe Gasper, echoed similar sentiments, highlighting the extent of Michigan's preparedness for any eventuality.

Adding to the chorus of concern, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker revealed that he had activated the National Guard in his state to "support our local law enforcement with any challenges related to the peaceful transition of power."

In Washington, DC, the sight of thousands of armed National Guard troops on the streets underscores the gravity of the situation ahead of the inauguration.

The tense atmosphere follows the shocking January 6 riot at the US Capitol, which has prompted Democratic leaders of four US congressional committees to launch a review of the events. Democratic US Representative Don Beyer of Virginia called for accountability, with House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler pledging a thorough investigation to understand what went wrong.

The united front exhibited by these leaders reflects a resolute approach to safeguarding democracy and ensuring that similar incidents do not occur in the future. As the nation prepares for the inauguration amid heightened security, the priority remains clear: to facilitate a peaceful transfer of power while preventing any further acts of violence.
