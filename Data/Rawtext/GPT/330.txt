Suez Canal Blockage: A New Challenge for Nigeria's Trade and Economy

In an unprecedented event that caught the global trading community off guard, the cargo ship 'The Ever Given' found itself wedged across the Suez Canal on 25th March 2021. This colossal artery of water is not just any canal; it's a pivotal link for trade between Asia and Europe. Accounting for around 12% of total global trade, the implications of this blockage are felt far and wide - a concern that has been amplified considering the ongoing turmoil caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Efforts to dislodge 'The Ever Given' from the canal's banks have been nothing short of monumental. A whopping 27,000 cubic meters of sand were excavated in a bid to free the behemoth ship. The world watched as every attempt was made to allow the resumption of normal traffic flow through this vital trade waterway.

Nigeria, with its heavy reliance on imports, stands at a crossroads owing to this incident. The delays in shipping are poised to usher in a new wave of increased prices for goods arriving in the country. Voicing his concerns, Okojie Larry, Vice President and Head of Trade & Marine Operations at Gladius Commodities Limited, predicts a noticeable impact on the prices of various goods. "Given Nigeria's import-dependent nature, we're likely to see an uptick in the prices of goods. This is due to the delays and the backlog of ships waiting to pass through the canal," Larry explained.

"The blockage could take days, if not weeks to clear," Larry elaborated on the potential duration and its consequent economic fallout. He pointed out that the incurred costs during this period would not only include heightened freight costs but also have a domino effect on companies and markets connected to the trade through the canal.

Contrasting these predictions, Private Oil Market Trader, Opeoluwa Dapo-Thomas, offered a somewhat different perspective. While acknowledging the potential increase in costs for ship owners and insurance companies, Dapo-Thomas remarked, "The impact on Nigeria might be negligible in the grand scheme of things. However, the real pain will be felt by ship owners and insurance companies due to increased costs."

Despite efforts leading to the partial refloating of 'The Ever Given', normal traffic flow through the Suez Canal remains a work-in-progress. This ongoing blockade not only affects the conveyance of crude oil but also raises concerns over potential demurrage and insurance claims – complications that Nigeria is no stranger to. Nigerian businesses have already started to feel the squeeze as they incur demurrages due to the blockage, a situation that signals tighter liquidity in the market.

In essence, while the global community rallies to undo this extraordinary snarl-up in one of the world's most important trade routes, Nigeria braces for the economic ripple effects. With the Suez Canal blockage serving as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities in global trade infrastructure, the weeks ahead will be telling of the resilience and adaptability of markets, not least Nigeria's, during these already turbulent times.
