Tom Brady Opens Up About Super Bowl Trophy Toss and Family Life with Gisele Bündchen

In a moment that became an iconic image of celebrations, Tom Brady's decision to throw the Lombardi Trophy across the water during the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Super Bowl LV victory parade left fans in awe and the quarterback himself in a bit of concern. Reflecting on the incident that took place on the Hillsborough River in Tampa, Florida, after the Buccaneers' monumental win in 2021, Brady expressed his reservations about the daring act.

Speaking to Michael Strahan of Good Morning America, Brady revealed, "In the moment, it felt like the right thing to do. But afterward, I was worried about the trophy's sharp edges and the fact that it could have seriously hurt someone or sunk to the bottom of the river if I had dropped it." The parade, staged on boats as a COVID-19 precaution, was a departure from traditional celebrations, adding to the day's uniqueness.

Despite the public's fascination with his celebratory antics, Brady admitted to Strahan that he feels more at ease away from the spotlight. "I've always been someone who prefers staying home over being the center of attention," he shared. Within the confines of his private life, Brady acknowledged the unwavering support of his wife, supermodel Gisele Bündchen. "Gisele has been my rock. She has made countless sacrifices to ensure our family remains strong," Brady stated.

With three children—Benjamin Rein (11), Vivian Lake (8), and John Edward (13), whom Brady shares with ex Bridget Moynahan—the couple places a strong emphasis on humility and hard work. Gisele Bündchen, echoing her husband's sentiments on family values, remarked, "We strive to keep our kids grounded, teaching them the value of hard work and making sure they understand that despite the unique life we lead, it's crucial they make their own impact in the world."

As Brady looks back on his illustrious career and forward to his family's future, it's clear that while football has brought him fame and accolades, the cornerstone of his legacy might just be the values he instills in his children, ensuring they're prepared for the world beyond the gridiron.
