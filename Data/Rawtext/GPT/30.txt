New Radicals Reunite for Biden-Harris Inauguration, Bringing "You Get What You Give" Message of Hope

In a moment that few could have predicted but many welcomed, the New Radicals, the band perhaps best known for their 1998 hit "You Get What You Give," reunited after 22 years for a special performance during the Biden-Harris virtual inaugural parade. This rare appearance not only celebrated President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris's entry into office but also served as a poignant reminder of the enduring power of music to inspire and heal a nation.

The New Radicals were originally formed as a duo, comprising singer Gregg Alexander and percussionist Danielle Brisebois. Their album, "Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too," dropped in 1998 to critical acclaim, combining sharp, socially aware lyrics with an exuberant pop-rock sound that resonated with listeners. However, it's their single "You Get What You Give" that has cemented its place in the annals of pop music history, celebrated for its ebullient melody and optimistic message.

Remarkably, the song has held significant personal meaning for the Biden family. President Biden's late son, Beau Biden, used "You Get What You Give" as a psych-up song during his chemotherapy treatments, a fact that President Biden has spoken about publicly. This personal connection added a layer of emotional depth to the New Radicals' performance, bridging the gap between personal and political, and highlighting the song's message of resilience and hope.

Despite their meteoric rise, the New Radicals was short-lived. They dissolved before they could release a second single from their album, largely because Alexander, the group's lead, found the spotlight and the pressures that came with it too overwhelming. Choosing to step away from the band, Alexander continued to work in the music industry, albeit in a less conspicuous manner, writing and producing songs for other artists and contributing to soundtracks. In doing so, Alexander and Brisebois continued to influence pop music from behind the scenes, leaving an indelible impact far beyond their brief tenure as performers.

The decision for Gregg Alexander to step into the light once more for the inauguration performance underscored not just a moment of personal triumph but a broader message of optimism and resilience for many who watched. In reviving the New Radicals, even if only for one song, Alexander reminded viewers of the power of music to unite and uplift, to incite change, and to provide solace.

"You Get What You Give" has, over time, evolved beyond its initial chart success to become something of an American standard. With its inclusion in the inaugural celebrations, it has arguably been adorned with a presidential seal of recognition—acknowledged not merely as a pop hit but as a cultural artifact that embodies a spirit of collective determination and hope. More than just a nostalgia act, the New Radicals' performance signaled a recommitment to the values of empathy, community, and the belief in America's capacity to 'pull through' its challenges.

The reunion and performance of the New Radicals speak volumes to the time we find ourselves in. As America stands at a crossroads, grappling with a pandemic, political division, and a cry for social justice, the message of "You Get What You Give" resounds with renewed importance. The song's lyrics, calling for generosity of spirit and a fight against cynicism, resonate with a nation seeking to heal and unite.

In sum, the return of the New Radicals for the Biden-Harris inauguration was more than a moment of musical nostalgia. It was a symbol of hope, a call to action, and a demonstration of the enduring power of music to articulate our deepest desires for change and unity. As America looks to the future, the optimistic message of "You Get What You Give" serves as both a comfort and a rallying cry, encouraging every listener to believe in their capacity to affect positive change, both big and small.
