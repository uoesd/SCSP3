Vice President Kamala Harris Takes the Helm of National Space Council, Signaling Continued Focus on Space

CNN – Vice President Kamala Harris has been announced as the new chair of the National Space Council, signaling not just a continuation but a prospective evolution in the United States' approach to space under the Biden administration. In a move that underscores the administration's commitment to maintaining America's leadership in space exploration and security, Harris outlined her enthusiasm and vision for her role in a recent tweet.

"It's an honor to lead the National Space Council," Harris tweeted. "America's possibilities in space are limitless. I'm excited to work on setting our nation's sights high into the stars."

Under the Trump administration, the council was revived in 2017 and led by then-Vice President Mike Pence. The decision to keep the council active under Vice President Harris, operating under the same executive order from 2017, reflects a desire for continuity in space policy, even as an ongoing review could prompt changes to the council's specific focus areas and operational guidelines.

An important shift in the council's agenda involves an emphasis on STEM education, cybersecurity regarding space systems, rules governing commercial space activities, the promotion of diversity in the space workforce, and the development of norms for peaceful activity in space.

A senior administration official highlighted, "Vice President Harris is keenly aware of the importance of space in both our national security and commercial sectors. She is looking forward to focusing on sustainable growth in space and, importantly, ensuring diversity in STEM fields that contribute to our space efforts. It's more about the work and less about big displays."

Harris' role as chair of the National Space Council adds to her portfolio of significant responsibilities, including leading diplomatic efforts in the Northern Triangle countries and efforts to expand broadband access across the United States. Additionally, her duties will shortly expand to include swearing in the newly confirmed NASA administrator, Bill Nelson, further solidifying her involvement in space policy.

While there is yet to be a set date for the first meeting of the council under Harris, the administration has indicated that she will begin her duties in earnest soon, marking a new chapter for American space policy and exploration.
