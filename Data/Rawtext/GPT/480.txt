Handcuffed Love: Ukrainian Couple Ends Relationship After 123 Days Together

KYIV (Reuters) – After spending 123 days handcuffed together in an attempt to mend their failing relationship, Ukrainian couple Viktoria Pustovitova and Alexandr Kudlay have decided to part ways. The couple, who began their unique journey on Valentine's Day, hoped that being physically inseparable would help them rekindle their love. However, the challenges of being constantly together led them to the realization that their relationship could not be saved by handcuffs.

Throughout their experiment, Pustovitova, a 29-year-old beautician, and Kudlay, a 33-year-old car salesman, documented their daily life on social media, gaining a significant following. From mundane tasks to personal moments, the couple shared every aspect of their lives together, bound by the metal links that kept them inches apart.

In an emotional statement, Pustovitova reflected on the end of their relationship, "It was a tough experience, but I learned that love is not about being physically close all the time. I missed my personal space, and despite being so close to Alexandr, I felt neglected."

Kudlay, on the other hand, realized through this experiment that they were not as well-matched as he had hoped. "Being handcuffed together taught us a lot about our relationship, and sadly, it showed us that we're not compatible as a couple," he said.

The couple decided to auction the handcuffs, pledging to donate part of the proceeds to charity, as a symbol of moving on from their shared experience. Their separation became official in a public event attended by Ukrainian TV news channels and a representative from a record book, marking the end of their unprecedented journey.

It is believed that no other couple has remained handcuffed together for as long a period, making Pustovitova and Kudlay's attempt a unique chapter in the annals of love and relationship experiments. Their final Instagram post, depicting them standing apart, signaled the end of their unique journey, leaving their followers with mixed emotions about love, independence, and the lengths some will go to save a relationship.
