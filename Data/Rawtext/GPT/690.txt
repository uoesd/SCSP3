$100 Million Lawsuit Filed Against Oxford School District for Fatal Shooting

Dec 9 (Reuters) – A lawsuit has been filed against the Oxford Community School District and several of its officials, seeking $100 million in damages over a shooting at Oxford High School, which left four students dead and seven others injured, including a teacher. The tragic event, perpetrated by a 15-year-old student of the school, has since ignited a wave of criticism and demand for accountability, leading to the lawsuit that accuses the school authorities of negligence.

The lawsuit targets the district's superintendent, the high school principal, and other staff members, alleging they failed to act upon numerous warnings regarding the shooter's disturbing and threatening behavior. Representing the victims in this legal battle are 17-year-old Riley Franz and her sister, Bella, aged 14, both of whom were directly impacted by the harrowing events of that day.

Central to the case is the accusation against the shooter's parents, who have been charged with involuntary manslaughter. It's alleged that they not only provided their son access to a firearm but also neglected numerous warning signs of his potential for violence. This charge adds a familial dimension to the legal scrutiny now surrounding the tragic incident.

The lawsuit further claims that the school district assured parents and students of their safety, despite being fully aware of the shooter, Ethan Crumbley's, disturbing online activity that hinted at his violent intentions. It criticizes the school's inadequate response to Crumbley's open threats of violence and his search for ammunition on a school device, actions that, according to the lawsuit, should have prompted immediate and decisive intervention.

Michigan personal injury attorney Geoffrey Fieger, representing the Franz sisters, fiercely criticized the school's approach to handling the situation. "The shooting was entirely preventable," Fieger stated, lambasting the school officials for their reassurances to parents and students about safety measures that ultimately failed to prevent the tragedy.

Fieger's stance underscores a significant part of the lawsuit's focus, which argues that not only did the school district fail to keep its students safe, but that it actually contributed to the conditions that allowed the shooting to occur. He explained, "This tragedy was the direct result of their inaction and the district's culture of apathy."

At the time of this report, the Oxford Community School District has yet to respond to the allegations made in the lawsuit. The silence from the district has done little to quell the growing concern among parents, students, and the community at large regarding the safety protocols and the seriousness with which threats of violence are addressed in schools.

As the lawsuit proceeds, it aims not only to seek justice for the victims and their families but also to serve as a sobering reminder of the critical importance of vigilance, accountability, and immediate action in the face of potential threats to student safety. The tragic events at Oxford High School have ignited a fervent dialogue on school safety, mental health, and gun control, with the hope that such a devastating occurrence is never repeated.
