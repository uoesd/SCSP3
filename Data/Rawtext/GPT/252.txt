FDA and CDC Lift Pause on Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Following Thorough Safety Review

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have announced the lifting of the recommended pause on the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine. This decision comes after a comprehensive safety review, involving medical and scientific teams who have rigorously assessed the risk of a rare and severe type of blood clot observed in some individuals following vaccination. The pause was initially recommended on April 13, 2021, due to six reports of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), now referred to as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).

During the pause, the FDA and CDC conducted an extensive evaluation of these reports, which involved outreach to healthcare providers and investigating each case thoroughly to understand the incidence and outcomes of TTS. The agencies have determined that the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine's known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks for individuals 18 years of age and older.

The investigation into the reported cases concluded that these instances of TTS are incredibly rare. Data suggest that the chance of this condition occurring is very low, but the FDA and CDC will remain vigilant in monitoring this and other reports of adverse events.

Healthcare providers administering the vaccine and vaccine recipients will find revised fact sheets that now include information about the risk of TTS. This decision to resume the vaccine's use was made in conjunction with the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which has reviewed the latest data on TTS and affirmed the vaccine's overall safety and efficacy profile.

Acting FDA Commissioner, Janet Woodcock, M.D., emphasized the government's commitment to safety stating, "Safety is our top priority. This pause was an example of our extensive safety monitoring working as they were designed to work—identifying even these small number of cases. We've lifted the pause based on the FDA and CDC's review of all available data and in consultation with medical experts and health department officials. We are confident that this vaccine continues to meet our standards for safety, effectiveness, and quality."

CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky also provided reassurance on the vaccine's safety and efficacy, highlighting the importance of consultation with healthcare providers. "Our vaccine safety systems are working. We identified exceptionally rare events - out of millions of doses of the J&J COVID-19 administered - and we paused to examine them more carefully. As we always do, we will continue to watch all signals closely as more Americans are vaccinated. I encourage anyone with questions about the COVID-19 vaccines to speak with their healthcare provider or local public health department," she said.

Following the careful review of all available data, a total of 15 cases of TTS have been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). All cases occurred in women between the ages of 18 and 59, with symptoms developing within one to two weeks following vaccination. This data helped to inform the FDA and CDC's decision-making process regarding the resumption of the vaccine.

The decision to lift the pause reflects the federal health agencies' commitment to act swiftly and transparently with any safety concerns and indicates strong confidence in the vaccine's safety and effectiveness for the general public.

A detailed risk-benefit analysis during the pause demonstrated that the vaccine's benefits in preventing COVID-19, with its potential risks of hospitalization and death, significantly outweigh the risk of TTS. This analysis and decision to lift the pause provide an important context for individuals considering vaccination.

The FDA and CDC earnestly encourage everyone 18 years of age and older in the U.S. to get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be the most effective tool against COVID-19 and its complications. The agencies also assure the public and the medical community that they will continue comprehensive surveillance for all vaccines, including the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, to ensure the public's health and safety.

Healthcare providers are instructed to report any adverse events following vaccination to VAERS. The FDA and CDC pledge to keep the public informed of any further information as it becomes available, reassuring the community of the vaccine's efficacy and safety profile amidst ongoing efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
