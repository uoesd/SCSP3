Social Media Platforms See Marked Decline in Election Disinformation After Trump Ban

In the wake of the Capitol riot on January 6, major social media platforms took unprecedented steps by suspending or banning former President Donald Trump and a slew of his allies. This drastic action has led to a significant downturn in the spread of election disinformation. Research firm Zignal found that immediately following the ban on January 8, there was a steep decline in disinformation across platforms.

Trump, a prolific user of social media to disseminate his views, was banned from not only Twitter but also Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch, Spotify, and Shopify. Twitter's decision to permanently suspend Trump's account marked a pivotal moment in curbing the former president's capability to spread misleading claims about the election.

Apart from the personal account suspensions, Twitter undertook a sweeping action by banning over 70,000 accounts affiliated with the QAnon conspiracy theory, further dampening the spread of disinformation. Hashtags associated with the Capitol riot saw a considerable drop in usage, indicating a broader impact on the dissemination of false narratives.

Kate Starbird, a disinformation researcher at the University of Washington, remarked on the effectiveness of the bans, stating, "The swift actions taken by these platforms have clearly had a significant impact on the spread of disinformation online. It demonstrates the power these platforms hold in shaping the information landscape."

Further emphasizing the change, Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, commented, "The decline in disinformation is a direct result of the de-platforming of key figures. It significantly disrupts their ability to communicate and mobilize their audience."

However, some experts caution that while the removal of accounts can curb momentum and limit the reach to new audiences, it may also entrench the views of those already engaged in the disinformation ecosystem. Leysia Palen, a professor of information science at the University of Colorado, highlighted this concern, noting, "De-platforming can certainly reduce the spread, but it also risks solidifying the beliefs of those who buy into false narratives, as they may see this as validation of their perceived 'suppression'."

A tangential observation by Media Matters for America found that interactions on right-leaning political Facebook pages have faced a significant decline post-ban, illustrating the broader impact of these actions across different social media platforms.

Research identified that a few accounts acted as 'superspreaders' of election misinformation, with Trump's account being a major source. By silencing these key accounts, social media platforms have managed to tamp down the volume of falsehoods significantly.

Advanced Democracy, a research organization, found that although claims of election fraud saw a decrease, violent narratives continue to spread at the peripheries of the mainstream social media ecosystem. This indicates that while major platforms have taken steps to reduce disinformation, the battle against spreading falsehoods and incitement is far from over.

The actions taken in January by social media companies mark a significant turning point in the fight against disinformation. While some celebrate the reduction in misleading claims about the election, others ponder the implications for free speech and political discourse online. As the dust settles, the long-term impacts of these bans on public discourse and disinformation will continue to unfold.
