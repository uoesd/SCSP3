Supreme Court Attendance Sparse at Biden's Inauguration Amid Pandemic Concerns

In a departure from over two decades of tradition, only six members of the Supreme Court attended President Joe Biden's swearing-in ceremony, underlining the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on public gatherings and perhaps hinting at deeper political and personal rifts.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito Jr. were notably absent from the January 20 event, a decision attributed to the prevailing public health crisis. "Due to the current public health situation, some justices are unable to attend the inauguration," said Kathleen Arberg, a spokeswoman for the Supreme Court, without specifying further details.

This marked shift to a more remote operation of the Supreme Court has been evident since March, as the justices have mostly worked from a distance, coming together in person only once since the pandemic's outset—for the memorial service of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

In a historic moment fraught with personal and political undercurrents, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who both Biden and Harris opposed during his confirmation in 2005, administered the presidential oath to Joe Biden. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, embodying a series of firsts as a Latina Supreme Court Justice, administered the oath to Vice President Kamala Harris, adding a symbolic layer to the ceremony.

The relationship between the newly inaugurated president and vice president with the Supreme Court is complex and storied, marked significantly by their historical voting records. Biden and Harris, both former senators, voted against the confirmation of six out of the nine justices currently sitting on the bench.

A notable point of contention in Biden's past with the Supreme Court includes his attempt to filibuster Alito's nomination—a move that reflects a broader history of tension, most memorably seen in Clarence Thomas's contentious confirmation hearings in 1991. During those hearings, Biden, then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, faced criticism for his handling of Anita Hill's sexual harassment allegations against Thomas.

Thomas has not shied away from publicly criticizing Biden, particularly taking issue with Biden's inquiries about natural law during the hearings, which Thomas perceived as a veiled attack on his character.

In a gesture that seemed intended to mend fences, Biden reached out to Anita Hill early in his 2020 presidential campaign, expressing regret over her treatment during Thomas's confirmation process—an acknowledgment of the historic and complex intersections between Biden's legislative career and the higher judiciary.

The absence of Justices Thomas, Breyer, and Alito at Biden's inauguration could be seen through various lenses—a reaction to health concerns or a non-verbal comment on the enduring tensions that have colored their interactions over the years. While the official stance attributes their absence to the pandemic, the undercurrents of political and personal differences cannot be overlooked.

As the nation moves forward under a new administration, the dynamic between the executive branch and the Supreme Court remains a topic of keen interest, particularly as it navigates the complexities of a pandemic, an ever-evolving legal landscape, and the memories of previous confrontations that have shaped, in part, the characters and convictions of those now leading the country.
