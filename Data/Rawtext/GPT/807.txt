No Fourth Stimulus Check as Congress Shifts Focus to Infrastructure and Families Plan

Washington CNN – Amidst ongoing economic recovery efforts, discussions about a potential fourth round of stimulus checks have stalled, as Congress sets its sights on other legislative priorities. This development comes despite some Democratic lawmakers expressing support for continuing direct financial assistance to Americans in the form of recurring payments.

Currently, there is no legislative proposal on the table for a fourth round of stimulus checks. This stands in contrast to earlier periods of the pandemic when three rounds of direct payments were authorized to help mitigate the economic fallout. However, the political landscape has shifted, with slim majorities in Congress and a previous emphasis on targeting the third round of payments to lower-income individuals making the continuation of such sweeping financial aid less likely.

Instead of pursuing another round of direct payments, lawmakers are now focusing their efforts on a massive infrastructure bill and President Biden's American Families Plan. Both initiatives are seen as crucial components of the administration's long-term economic recovery strategy but notably do not include provisions for new stimulus checks.

However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is actively addressing payment discrepancies for individuals who have become eligible for additional money due to income losses in 2020. These 'plus-up' payments are automatically dispatched to those whose recent tax returns indicate they qualify for more than what was initially disbursed.

In parallel, a significant component of the pandemic aid package passed in March 2021 — the expanded child tax credit — is set to come into effect. Starting July 15, more than 36 million families will begin receiving periodic payments to assist with child-rearing expenses. Eligible parents can expect up to $3,600 per child under the age of 6 and $3,000 for each child under 18, marking an increase from the previous maximum of $2,000 per child.

This enhanced child tax credit has been designed to benefit a broader range of families, with eligibility extending to single parents earning up to $75,000 and couples filing jointly who make up to $150,000 annually. Furthermore, making the child tax credit fully refundable means that an additional 20 million children, particularly those in the lowest income brackets, stand to benefit from this provision.

While some Americans may be disappointed by the absence of a fourth stimulus check, the administration's shift towards long-term investments and targeted financial support measures reflects a strategic approach to fostering economic resilience and recovery as the nation moves beyond the immediate crisis.
