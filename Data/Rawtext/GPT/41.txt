UAE Strikes $23.37 Billion Deal with US for F-35 Jets and Reaper Drones

WASHINGTON – In a significant military purchase, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) signed an agreement on January 20 to buy up to 50 F-35 Lightning II jets and 18 MQ-9 Reaper drones from the United States, marking one of the final moves of the Trump administration an hour before President Joe Biden's inauguration. The letter of agreement between US and UAE officials outlines the sale's terms, cementing a deal that spans aircraft, munitions, and drones valuing approximately $23.37 billion.

While the specifics of the deal, including cost and technical specifications, have been agreed upon, the initial delivery date, which could be as far off as 2027, remains undecided. This monumental agreement hinges on future negotiations and could see adjustments, especially financial, with manufacturers like Lockheed Martin for the F-35 jets and General Atomics for the drones.

The transition to the Biden administration casts a veil of uncertainty on the future of this arms deal. The new administration has pledged to review the agreement carefully, amid concerns over Middle East stability and military balances, particularly in relation to maintaining Israel's qualitative military edge—a point emphasized by Antony Blinken, Biden's nominee for Secretary of State.

Despite the controversy and potential for review, the US Senate failed to block the sale in December, showing a partisan split in favor of the deal. This military sale underscores the complex dynamics of international arms agreements and the geopolitical stakes involved.

Requests for comments from the departments of State and Defense on the Biden administration's stance and the potential impact of the deal went unanswered, leaving questions about the future of US-UAE defense relations and the broader implications for regional security and diplomatic alliances in the Middle East.
