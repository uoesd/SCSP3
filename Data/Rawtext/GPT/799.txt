Biden's American Rescue Plan Act Rolls Out Third Stimulus Check: How to Claim Yours

In a significant development, President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act into law, authorizing the distribution of a third round of stimulus checks to millions of Americans. The IRS, tasked with executing this mandate, has already dispatched over 156 million payments, providing much-needed relief to citizens amid the ongoing economic struggles.

For individuals anxiously awaiting their third stimulus check, the IRS provides a crucial tool - the Get My Payment application. This platform is designed to help track the status of their stimulus payment, offering clarity and alleviating concerns regarding the arrival of these funds.

However, what about those who missed out on the first or second stimulus checks? For those in this situation, there's a pathway to claim these payments. The IRS has made it clear that these individuals must file their 2020 taxes to be eligible. It's an essential step, as it opens the door to receiving the stimulus money they're entitled to.

When filing taxes, attention must be given to Line 30 of the 1040 (or 1040-SR) form. This line is specifically designed for taxpayers to request any unpaid stimulus money. It's a straightforward process but one that requires accurate information to ensure success.

To aid in this calculation, the IRS offers worksheets and tax-filing software. These resources simplify the process, allowing individuals to accurately determine the exact amount they are owed. It's a critical step, given that knowing both how much was previously received and the total amount entitled is necessary for claiming the unpaid funds.

Should there be a discrepancy between the claimed amount and the IRS's calculations, the agency will notify the individual by sending a letter. This communication is vital as it explains the difference and provides guidance on the next steps to ensure that taxpayers receive what they are rightfully owed.

One of the significant benefits of claiming unpaid stimulus payments is the potential impact on tax refunds. For many, the adjustments to stimulus payments could lead to a larger tax refund. Alternatively, it could also serve to reduce any outstanding bills with the IRS, providing financial relief in another form.

It's important to note that the window to claim these funds is limited. The deadline to file 2020 taxes and consequently claim any unpaid stimulus funds has been extended to May 17, 2021. This extension provides a bit more breathing room for those yet to file their taxes but underscores the urgency of taking action to ensure these benefits are not forfeited.

In summary, the American Rescue Plan Act represents a critical effort to provide financial assistance to Americans during these challenging times. With the rollout of the third stimulus check, the IRS has undertaken a significant task. However, for those yet to receive their payment or who missed out on earlier rounds, there are clear steps to follow to claim what is rightfully theirs. By understanding the process and utilizing the tools and resources provided by the IRS, individuals can navigate their way to receiving their stimulus payments. The clock is ticking, and the deadline for claiming unpaid funds is fast approaching. Now is the time for action to ensure no one is left behind in receiving these crucial financial lifelines.
