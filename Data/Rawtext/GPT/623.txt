Vice President Harris Visits NASA, Emphasizes Role of Space in Climate Science Innovation

In a significant visit to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Vice President Kamala Harris focused on the critical role of climate science in our understanding of Earth's evolving environmental landscape. Highlighting the visit, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson presented the first images from Landsat 9, showcasing vivid depictions of environmental changes across the globe. Captured on October 31, these images are the latest contribution to nearly half a century of continuous Earth observation, a monumental effort in tracking and understanding our planet's changing dynamics.

During the visit, Administrator Nelson emphasized the importance of this ongoing mission, stating, "Landsat 9's images, which unveil changes in our environment with remarkable clarity, are a testament to NASA's enduring commitment to monitoring Earth's natural landscapes. This mission not only enriches our scientific understanding but also underlines the necessity of our endeavors in safeguarding our planet."

Vice President Harris underscored the broad-ranging potential of space activity in her discussions, pointing out its critical impact on climate action, education, economic growth, innovation, inspiration, security, and national strength. Furthermore, she brought attention to a new Earth Venture Mission-3 (EVM-3) named INCUS, emphasizing its goal to enhance our comprehension of how storms develop, thereby contributing significantly to our ability to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events.

Reaffirming the Biden-Harris Administration's dedication to the climate crisis, Harris highlighted the pivotal role of climate data from agencies such as NASA, NOAA, and the USGS in comprehending and responding to extreme weather and climate phenomena. "Our commitment to addressing the climate crisis is unwavering, and the invaluable data provided by these agencies is foundational in our endeavors," Harris noted.

NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D., also commented on the collaboration between NOAA and NASA, stating, "The partnership between NOAA and NASA is instrumental in advancing our capabilities in climate and weather monitoring, thereby enhancing our preparedness and response strategies to environmental challenges."

Assistant Secretary for Water and Science at the Department of the Interior, Tanya Trujillo, highlighted the integral role of satellite data in managing natural resources effectively. "The insights gained from NASA, NOAA, and USGS data are crucial in our pursuit of sustainable water management and conservation practices," Trujillo said.

Moreover, Harris's engagement extended to operating a robotic arm for future Landsat 7 missions and exploring the under-construction PACE mission, designed to assess the health of our oceans, signifying a hands-on commitment to advancing Earth sciences. Through meetings with scientists and engineers, the Vice President delved into discussions on NASA's pivotal role in addressing global climate challenges, underlining a joint effort across agencies and disciplines to pioneer a sustainable future.
