President Biden Unveils Bold Plan to Accelerate COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts

Washington, D.C. — In a major address to the nation, President Joe Biden today announced an ambitious, comprehensive strategy to ramp up the fight against COVID-19, marking a significant step forward in the nation's efforts to curb the pandemic. Central to the President's plan is a significant increase in vaccine supply and funding, aimed at ensuring that more Americans can receive their vaccinations as swiftly and safely as possible.

Starting this week, states, Tribes, and territories across the United States will see a 5 percent increase in vaccine supply, signaling the administration's commitment to enhancing vaccine accessibility. This initiative is part of the President's broader goal to administer 100 million vaccine shots within his first 100 days in office. To achieve this, the vaccine supply to states, Tribes, and territories is set to rise to 10.5 million doses weekly, marking a 22% increase since January 20, 2021. The administration has pledged to maintain this increased supply level for at least the next three weeks, providing a critical boost to local vaccination efforts across the country.

Moreover, President Biden announced the launch of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination, set to kick off on February 11. This program will offer vaccines through select pharmacies, leveraging a network of 21 national pharmacy partners and independents representing over 40,000 pharmacy locations nationwide. In its initial phase, with a limited vaccine supply, priority groups will receive vaccinations at no cost, underscoring the administration's commitment to equitable vaccine distribution.

In a move to bolster state responses to the pandemic, President Biden has directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fully reimburse states for COVID-related costs incurred by National Guard Personnel and emergency measures, retroactively from the start of the pandemic. This approach not only recognizes the crucial role states have played in managing the crisis but also provides them with much-needed financial relief. The administration estimates that these retroactive FEMA reimbursements will total between $3-5 billion.

Recognizing the immense fiscal pressures faced by state and local governments in these challenging times, the President has called on Congress to include $350 billion in the American Rescue Plan. This funding is essential for ensuring that states, cities, and counties have the resources they need to tackle the pandemic and lay the foundations for a robust economic recovery.

Today's announcements are a testament to President Biden's resolve to turn the tide on a pandemic that has claimed too many lives and upended livelihoods across the nation. Through increased vaccine supply, enhanced federal support, and collaboration with states and private partners, the administration is taking decisive action to protect the health and well-being of all Americans.
