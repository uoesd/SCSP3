Search for Gabby Petito Focuses on Wyoming as Family Urges Boyfriend to Cooperate

SALT LAKE CITY – The disappearance of Gabby Petito has gripped the nation, prompting a widespread search spanning multiple states. FOX 13 News has confirmed that Gabby's last known location was at a Fairfield Inn and Suites near Salt Lake City International Airport on August 24. Employees of the hotel have reported that the FBI and police officers have visited the establishment recently, confirming Gabby's stay for over a day.

As the investigation intensifies, the focus has shifted towards Wyoming, based on her last known communications. The family's desperation grows with each passing day devoid of contact or information regarding Gabby's whereabouts.

James Schmidt, Petito's stepfather, has been actively involved in the search and shared insights into the ongoing efforts. "Law enforcement has been wonderful. They're doing everything they can. We're working collectively with them as they continue their search efforts," Schmidt said. He has remained hopeful, emphasizing the relentless pursuit of any leads that might bring Gabby home.

The situation has been further complicated by the lack of cooperation from Brian Laundrie, Gabby Petito's boyfriend, who has been named a person of interest in her disappearance. Laundrie returned to his home in early September without Petito, hiring a lawyer and refusing to speak with police.

Richard Stafford, a spokesman for the Petito family, expressed deep frustration with Laundrie's silence. "Brian Laundrie's lack of cooperation with the police is reprehensible. We beg him to do the right thing and help us find Gabby," Stafford stated. The family's plea for transparency underscores their desperation for any information that could lead to Gabby's safe return.

Laundrie's designation as a person of interest but not a suspect has further fueled public speculation and scrutiny surrounding the case. His refusal to cooperate has drawn criticism, with many urging him to provide any information that could assist in locating Gabby.

Gabby Petito was officially reported missing on September 11, igniting a search that has captured the attention of people across the country. The community and the Petito family continue to hold onto hope, urging anyone with information to step forward.

The investigation continues, with law enforcement agencies pooling their resources to piece together Gabby's movements and whereabouts before her disappearance. The family remains hopeful, with Schmidt and Stafford leading public appeals for assistance in bringing Gabby home safely. As the search moves to Wyoming, all involved hold onto hope for a safe resolution.
