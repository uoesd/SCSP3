Fall River Police Apologize for Controversial George Floyd Facebook Post

FALL RIVER, MA – The Fall River Police Department has issued an apology following a controversial Facebook post that criticized George Floyd and referenced the verdict of Derek Chauvin, sparking wide condemnation across social media. The post suggested that Floyd should have behaved as Chauvin did upon his arrest, leading to a swift backlash from the public.

Police Chief Jeffrey Cardoza announced that the department has taken action by removing the post and issuing a formal apology. "This post was a regrettable error in judgment and does not reflect the values of the Fall River Police Department," Cardoza said. He emphasized that such viewpoints are not representative of the department's stance or its officers.

The controversy arose when an officer, intending to repost the controversial message to their personal page, mistakenly posted it on the official Fall River Police Department's Facebook page. Upon realizing the mistake, department officials acted quickly to remove the post.

Chief Cardoza revealed that the officer involved in this incident has been reassigned to duties that do not involve contact with the public while the matter is under scrutiny. An external investigator has been brought in to review the case thoroughly.

Cardoza stated, "We are committed to fair and unbiased policing, and this incident has only doubled our resolve to ensure our officers are trained in these essential values."

Mayor Paul Coogan responded to the incident, highlighting the remorse felt by the officer involved. "The officer is very remorseful and believes he has let people down. We are all keenly aware of the impact actions like these have on the community," said Mayor Coogan.

The incident is currently under investigation, and disciplinary actions have not been ruled out as the department seeks to address the implications of the post.

Police Chief Cardoza has stressed that the incident, though regrettable, will serve as a catalyst for continued focus on training and education around fair policing practices. The department aims to rebuild any trust lost with the community through their swift actions and commitment to values that reject prejudice and embrace fairness and equality.
