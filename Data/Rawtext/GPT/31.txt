Taiwan Strengthening Ties with U.S.: A Presence at Biden's Inauguration

Taipei (Reuters) – In a significant signal of strong ties between Taiwan and the United States, Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan's de facto ambassador in Washington, was officially invited to attend President Joe Biden's inauguration. This move comes after a period of notably increased support for Taiwan during Donald Trump's presidency, which included substantial arms sales and visits by high-ranking officials but resulted in heightened tensions with China.

Under Trump's administration, Taiwan saw a level of support that hadn't been witnessed for decades, leading to concerns among some in Taiwan about whether President Joe Biden would maintain this high level of backing. Addressing these concerns, Emily Horne, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, reinforced the United States' unwavering stance towards Taiwan. "The U.S. commitment to Taiwan is rock-solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region," she stated.

For the first time, Taiwan's official representation was invited to a U.S. president's inauguration, marking a milestone in the relationship between the two regions. "This unprecedented arrangement of an official invitation to our representative in the U.S. to attend the inauguration ceremony once again demonstrates the close friendship and robust connections based on shared values of democracy, freedom, and human rights between Taiwan and the United States," Joanne Ou, spokeswoman for Taiwan's foreign ministry, highlighted.

Though the United States formally severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979, opting instead to recognize China, it nonetheless remains legally obligated to assist Taiwan in its defense efforts. The significance of Hsiao Bi-khim's attendance was not lost on her. "I am honored to represent the people and government of Taiwan here at the inauguration of President Biden and Vice President Harris. Democracy is our common objective, and freedom is our common cause," she remarked.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen conveyed her congratulations to the U.S., holding onto hope for the continuation of partnership in fostering regional democracy, freedom, peace, and stability. The Biden administration seems open to maintaining a strong relationship with Taiwan, with Biden's nominee for Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, showing support for greater engagement with the island. Notably, Tsai and Blinken had previously met in 2015, indicating a foundational relationship between the current U.S. administration and Taiwan. This backdrop of mutual respect and shared goals promises to be the cornerstone of ongoing and sustainable collaboration between the two parties.
