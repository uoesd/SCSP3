Rethinking Safety: Wilmington Reflects on Film Set Incidents Amid 'Rust' Shooting Tragedy

In the wake of the fatal shooting on the 'Rust' film set in New Mexico, the film industry is once again grappling with the grim reminder of on-set safety risks — a conversation all too familiar to the Wilmington film community, which still vividly remembers the tragic death of Brandon Lee on the set of 'The Crow' in 1993. This incident has sparked intense debate and reflection within the industry, especially among veterans who have witnessed firsthand the evolution of safety protocols over the decades.

Charlie Coleman, an experienced on-set armorer, has voiced his concerns regarding how the push for tighter production schedules and strict adherence to COVID-19 protocols might be compromising essential safety measures. "We're seeing more demands being put on production teams, and sometimes, it feels like safety is what's being sacrificed to meet these deadlines," Coleman stated, underlining the pressing issue facing many film sets today.

Following the 'Rust' shooting, there's been a noticeable shift in how film productions approach the use of real firearms on set. Coleman revealed that several of his current projects have opted for 'silent blanks' — a safer alternative that doesn't compromise the authenticity of on-screen action. "There's definitely been a push to rethink how we approach gun scenes, looking for ways to maintain the visual effect without the inherent risks," Coleman shared.

The debate over the necessity of real guns on set is not new. However, the 'Rust' incident has reignited these discussions, with many advocating for the use of CGI and advanced technology to circumvent the need for live firearms altogether. While Coleman acknowledges the potential for tech solutions to enhance safety, he also points out the complexities involved. "Firearms can be managed safely with the right protocols and training. However, it's the human element — the potential for error — that poses the biggest challenge," he explained.

Wilmington's film industry has seen significant improvements in set safety since the '90s, with no major accidents reported in over two decades. However, the area's history is marked by several high-profile incidents that have contributed to the nationwide conversation on set safety standards. Apart from the tragic death of Brandon Lee, there have been other serious incidents, including accidents on the sets of 'Maximum Overdrive' and 'Cyborg,' which resulted in severe injuries and subsequent legal actions.

The incident on 'The Crow' set remains among the most notorious accidents in film history, resulting in increased safety measures and awareness industry-wide. In another incident, an on-set explosion during the filming of 'Black Dog' in 1998 caused burn injuries to three people, further underscoring the unpredictable nature of film production environments.

A less severe, yet significant incident occurred on the 'Iron Man 3' set in Wilmington in 2012, where Robert Downey Jr. broke his ankle, leading to a delay in production. While not fatal, this incident highlights the spectrum of potential injuries that can occur on set, ranging from minor to life-threatening.

Coleman emphasizes the importance of continuous education and adherence to safety protocols to prevent accidents. "Every incident, no matter how small, is an opportunity to learn and improve. It's essential that we keep safety at the forefront of every decision, every scene, and every shot," Coleman remarked.

As the film industry continues to navigate the challenges of ensuring on-set safety, the lessons learned from past incidents in Wilmington and beyond serve as stark reminders of the stakes involved. With the advancement of technology and a renewed focus on safety protocols, the industry hopes to mitigate these risks, ensuring that tragic incidents become a thing of the past.
