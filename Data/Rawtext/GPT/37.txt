6,200 National Guard Personnel Deploy to Washington in Wake of Capitol Riot

WASHINGTON – In the aftermath of the riot at the Capitol, the National Guard is bolstering its presence in Washington D.C., with Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy announcing the deployment of 6,200 personnel for a minimum of 30 days. This move comes as the city, and the nation, prepares for the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden amidst a tumultuous political climate. McCarthy shed light on the pre-riot intelligence, describing it as inconsistent, with estimates on crowd sizes varying significantly. "What we faced was a challenge in determining the scale of the threat due to the variable intelligence picture," McCarthy stated. He emphasized that these unclear indications made it difficult to anticipate the extent of the violence that would unfold.

The decision to increase the National Guard's presence was a direct response to the scenes of chaos witnessed on January 6, as rioters breached the Capitol, disrupting the congressional session intended to certify Biden's electoral win. During the incident, roughly 1,100 National Guard troops were mobilized to assist local law enforcement in managing the situation. The deployment aims to ensure the safety of the inauguration ceremony, supporting duties such as traffic control and law enforcement. Amidst mounting concerns over security, former presidents and officials have voiced their condemnation of the violent events and the attempt to undermine the electoral process.

President Donald Trump, who has yet to concede defeat, encouraged his supporters on the day of the riot but has notably refrained from condemning their actions. Meanwhile, the incoming administration is proceeding with caution, adjusting Biden's inauguration plans in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a clear focus on virtual participation to minimize public health risks. President-elect Biden has condemned the riot as an "assault on democracy," calling for an immediate end to the violence. "The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect a true America, do not represent who we are," Biden said. As Washington braces for the inauguration, the presence of the National Guard aims to provide a semblance of stability in an unprecedentedly volatile period.
