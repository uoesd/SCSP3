'The Rookie' Bans Live Weapons on Set Following 'Rust' Tragedy

CNN – In response to the tragic incident on the set of 'Rust,' where cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot, ABC's hit show 'The Rookie' has decided to ban the use of 'live' weapons during filming. Showrunner Alexi Hawley sent a poignant letter to the cast and crew, announcing the significant change in the show's approach to prop guns.

Following the heartbreaking news of Hutchins' death during the production of 'Rust,' the entertainment industry has been compelled to re-evaluate its safety protocols regarding the use of firearms on set. Halyna Hutchins was killed when Alec Baldwin, told that he was being handed a 'cold gun' (meaning it was safe), discharged a prop gun that unexpectedly contained live rounds.

Alexi Hawley addressed the decision directly, underscoring the paramount importance of ensuring the safety and well-being of all individuals involved in the production of 'The Rookie.' "The tragic incident on the set of 'Rust' has reminded us all of the importance of maintaining rigorous safety standards. Our decision to implement a ban on live weapons is a crucial step towards ensuring such an incident never occurs on our set," Hawley stated in his letter.

To adapt to the new rule, the production will now use Airsoft guns, which are replica toy guns used for airsoft sports. These replicas are capable of firing non-metallic projectiles and will be used in conjunction with post-production effects to simulate gunfire. This ensures the visual authenticity of the show while significantly reducing the risks associated with handling real firearms.

Weapons expert Ben Simmons explained the categorization of prop guns, shedding light on the various types used in film production. "Prop guns are generally categorized into three types: fake guns, which are essentially harmless props; deactivated firearms, which are real guns modified to prevent them from firing; and real firearms, which are capable of firing live ammunition," Simmons clarified.

In the aftermath of the 'Rust' incident, the distinction and appropriate use of such prop categories have come under intense scrutiny. The fatal shooting is still under investigation, with the film's assistant director, David Halls, having admitted to unknowingly handing Baldwin a gun loaded with live rounds. "I was told it was a cold gun," Halls reportedly said of the tragic mix-up.

CNN has reached out to representatives from ABC and 'The Rookie' for further comments regarding the new safety protocols and any additional measures being implemented to prevent future incidents.

This decision by 'The Rookie' is perhaps the beginning of a much-needed industry-wide shift towards safer set environments, emphasizing that no scene, no matter how crucial, is worth compromising the safety of the cast and crew. As the investigation into the 'Rust' shooting continues, it is a somber reminder of the paramount importance of stringent safety measures in any production involving potentially hazardous props.
