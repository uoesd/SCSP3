GOP Infighting Intensifies as Cheney Ousted and Pro-Impeachment Republicans Face Backlash

CNN – The Republican Party is grappling with intense internal conflict as House Republicans ousted Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney from her leadership role as conference chair, a move reflecting her outspoken criticism of former President Donald Trump's unfounded claims about the 2020 election. Cheney's removal underscores a broader rift within the GOP, with those opposed to Trump's narrative facing significant backlash.

Among those feeling the heat are the nine House Republicans who joined Cheney in voting to impeach Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot. This group has encountered a relentless wave of censure, primary challenges, and intra-party criticism, highlighting the GOP's ongoing struggle with its identity and direction in the post-Trump era.

Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger, an adamant critic of the party's current trajectory, has voiced strong support for Cheney and the other beleaguered Republicans. In response to the growing endorsement of conspiracy theories and allegiance to Trump within the party, Kinzinger has launched a political action committee called "Country First." Through it, he aims to provide a counter-narrative and support those in the GOP who prioritize principles over party loyalty. "It's time to put country over party. It's time to dismiss fear, conspiracy theories, and lies," Kinzinger stated.

John Katko of New York, one of the Republicans who voted for impeachment, faced disapproval from local GOP leaders but remains steadfast in his decision. "I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, and I will always put my country first," Katko asserted, underscoring the tensions between personal convictions and party expectations.

Michigan Congressman Fred Upton echoed this sentiment after being censured by local Republican parties for his vote. "I don't regret my vote. The principle matters more than party loyalty," Upton remarked, highlighting the dilemma faced by Republicans who broke ranks over impeachment.

Washington's Jaime Herrera Beutler, despite condemnation from the state's Republican Central Committee, defended her impeachment vote as necessary for accountability. "My vote was compelled by the oath I swore to the Constitution," she stated, adding weight to the argument for adhering to constitutional responsibilities over party politics.

Dan Newhouse, another Washington Congressman, expressed no regrets over his vote against Trump, despite backlash from the former president's supporters. "Standing up for the truth and for our democracy is worth any political cost," Newhouse affirmed.

Peter Meijer from Michigan shared concerns about the GOP's future and the increasing influence of conspiracy theories. "If we continue down this path, we're going to turn off a generation of voters," Meijer observed. His stance has resulted in censure from GOP county groups and a primary challenge from Tom Norton, indicating the deep divisions within the party over its direction and the loyalty demanded toward Trump.

As the Republican Party navigates these challenges, the actions and words of these congress members underscore a pivotal moment of introspection on what it means to be a Republican in today's political landscape.
