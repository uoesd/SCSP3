Harry and Meghan's Financial Independence: From Royal Funding to Hollywood Millions

In an unprecedented move that captured the world's attention, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, stepped down as senior members of the British royal family in early 2020. The couple announced their intention to become financially independent and relocated to California, marking a new chapter in their lives.

Before their departure from royal duties, Harry and Meghan's lifestyle was largely funded by the Duchy of Cornwall, a vast estate that provided about 95% of their income, with the remaining 5% coming from the Sovereign Grant. This funding supported their work on behalf of the Queen and covered their official residence's expenses.

Seeking a fresh start in the United States, Harry and Meghan purchased a lavish $14.7 million estate in Montecito, California. This new chapter came with significant financial responsibilities, including an estimated annual security cost of around $3 million, a necessity due to their high profile.

Initially, Prince Harry's financial independence was buoyed by a $13 million trust from his late mother, Princess Diana. Meghan contributed $2 million from her successful acting career, notably from her role in the television series "Suits". Despite their considerable resources, the couple's ambition to become self-sufficient in their finances has led them to explore various avenues.

Their net worth has seen significant growth thanks to lucrative contracts within the entertainment industry. In September 2020, Harry and Meghan signed a groundbreaking $100 million contract with Netflix to produce a range of productions, from documentaries to children's programming.

Their first project with Netflix, "Heart of Invictus," focuses on the inspiring stories of competitors preparing for the Invictus Games—an event founded by Prince Harry for wounded, injured, or sick armed services personnel and their associated veterans.

Expanding their media presence, the Sussexes also announced a partnership with Spotify, with a deal potentially worth $35 million, to produce and host podcasts aimed at building community through shared experiences and voices.

Meghan's literary pursuits have also contributed to their income, with her book "The Bench" achieving New York Times Bestseller status in the children's picture book category. While exact figures have not been disclosed, speculation suggests Meghan could have received an advance of $700,000 for the book.

As they continue to build their new life in California, Harry and Meghan's journey from royal funding to securing multi-million dollar deals in the entertainment industry underscores their commitment to financial independence and carving out a distinct identity beyond the shadow of the monarchy.
