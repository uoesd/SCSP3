Hollywood Reckons with On-Set Gun Safety Following 'Rust' Tragedy

Hollywood's fascination with firearms dates back to 1903 with the release of "The Great Train Robbery." However, the tragic accidental shooting by Alec Baldwin on the set of "Rust," leading to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, has ignited a fervent debate over the use of guns in film production. As the industry grapples with this issue, many, including "Black Panther" cinematographer Rachel Morrison, are advocating for a safer approach. "There's no reason to hang onto the old ways when technology offers safer alternatives," said Morrison, highlighting the availability of digital effects and non-lethal props.

In response to the outcry, several productions have begun to shift towards airsoft guns and computer-generated imagery (CGI) to simulate gunfire. This move not only prioritizes safety but is also seen as a cost-effective solution. ABC's crime drama "The Rookie" made headlines after its decision to ban the use of live weapons on set, a change spearheaded by showrunner Alexi Hawley, who emphasized the importance of ensuring the cast and crew's safety above all.

Amidst these changes within the industry, California State Senator Dave Cortese announced plans to introduce legislation prohibiting the use of live ammunition and firearms on movie and theatrical production sets in California. "The safety of our production teams should never be in question. Legislation is a necessary step to ensure tragedies like what happened on the 'Rust' set never occur again," Cortese stated.

The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) is also taking a stand, pushing for comprehensive safety measures as part of their ongoing contract negotiations with studios. The union's efforts underscore a growing consensus on the need to reevaluate on-set safety protocols.

However, not all agree with the outright ban of firearms capable of firing blanks. Critics of such a ban argue for a balanced approach that eliminates live ammunition but retains the use of guns designed exclusively for blanks, provided that strict safety protocols are followed. "Proper training and adherence to safety procedures can ensure the safe use of blank-firing firearms on set," said Dan Frenkel, a well-regarded cinematographer and armorer.

Contrastingly, a group of armorers and weapons masters, including Gary Truers, who worked on "Jurassic World," emphasizes the importance of competency and strict adherence to safety protocols already in place. "The focus should be on ensuring those handling firearms on set are fully trained and competent, rather than banning tools that are safe when used correctly," Truers explained.

As the industry searches for solutions, many, including producer Cassian Elwes and "Lucifer" co-showrunner Joe Henderson, are turning towards CG gun effects, arguing that they not only enhance safety but can also meet the high standards of realism audiences expect from modern filmmaking. The aftermath of the "Rust" shooting may indeed mark a pivotal moment in Hollywood's long-standing relationship with firearms, propelling the industry towards a safer and more technologically advanced future.
