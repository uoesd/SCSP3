Pula, a black Labrador, holds a special place in the hearts of Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle. The couple adopted her shortly after their wedding, and her name carries significant meaning, reflecting the couple's deep connection to Botswana. In Setswana, the language of Botswana, 'Pula' means 'rain'—a symbol of blessing and good fortune.

The world caught a glimpse of Pula's role in the Sussex family during Harry and Meghan's candid interview with Oprah Winfrey. In that conversation, Pula's presence highlighted the couple's cherished family life, further endearing them to fans and supporters worldwide. Alongside Pula, the family's pet roster includes Meghan's rescue beagle, Guy, and their son, Archie, painting a picture of a household filled with love and companionship.
