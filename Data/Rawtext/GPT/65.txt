'QAnon Shaman' Sentenced to 41 Months for Role in Capitol Riot

Jacob Chansley, the individual widely known as the 'QAnon Shaman', has been sentenced to 41 months in prison for his involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot. The sentence, handed down by Judge Royce Lamberth, reflects Chansley's guilty plea to a single count of obstructing a proceeding of Congress. While Judge Lamberth acknowledged Chansley's expression of remorse as genuine, stating, "I believe your remorse is genuine," he underscored the gravity of Chansley's behavior on that tumultuous day. Chansley will be credited for time already served since his arrest. Prosecutors, highlighting Chansley's early and prominent role in the riot, had argued for a 51-month sentence. Prosecutor Kimberly Paschall pointed out the harrowing nature of Chansley's actions, noting, "A video showed Chansley howling inside Congress, which was chilling." Despite the defense's plea for leniency based on Chansley's mental health issues and remorse, with Chansley himself insisting, "I am not a violent man or a domestic terrorist," his actions were ultimately deemed a significant affront to the peaceful transfer of presidential power.
