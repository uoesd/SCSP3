Kenosha Judge Defends Unconventional Jury Selection in Rittenhouse Trial

In an unusual turn of events during the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder took time to defend his decision allowing the defendant to select six alternate jurors from a raffle tumbler. This practice, which veers from the norm, saw Rittenhouse, an 18-year-old charged with fatally shooting two men and injuring a third during civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, personally drawing the numbers of the jurors who would stand as alternates and not participate in the deliberations.

Judge Schroeder, addressing the matter, revealed that this method of selection has been a part of his courtroom for nearly two decades. "I have been doing it this way for I'd say 20 years, perhaps longer," Schroeder stated. Despite its peculiarity, Schroeder confirmed that allowing defendants to draw alternate jurors has never been a point of contention or complaint.

Typically, in a courtroom setting, a clerk would be the one responsible for drawing jurors' numbers. However, Schroeder provides a backdrop to the tradition's unusual nature by referencing a past trial in Racine, Wisconsin, where the decision to adopt this practice originated. His motivation, at the time, was to avoid the bad optics that might arise from a clerk conducting the draw.

Schroeder elaborated on his reasoning, believing that allowing defendants to have a hand in the process could foster a better perception among those involved. "I think it helps to give the appearance of fairness," he explained. "It's been my experience that allowing the defendant to draw the numbers makes people, particularly the defendant, feel better about the process and maintains an element of control."

The decision to let Rittenhouse draw the alternate jurors went unopposed by both prosecutors and defense attorneys throughout the trial. Schroeder, in response to critics of the practice, staunchly defended his decision, suggesting that the critique aimed to undermine the integrity of the trial's outcome. "It's disappointing to see that some are questioning the method as if it's designed to prejudice the trial's result," Schroeder commented, dismissing such claims as unfounded.

Moreover, Schroeder's decisions during the trial extended beyond just the jury selection process. He also addressed his rationale for barring the use of the word "victims" to describe the men Rittenhouse shot, a practice that he noted is standard in his courtroom to avoid prejudicing the jury. "It's a longstanding rule in my courtroom," Schroeder stated. "We don't use the word 'victims' before there's a verdict. It's a matter of maintaining impartiality."

Rittenhouse, who pleaded not guilty, claimed he acted in self-defense during the incidents that transpired amidst Kenosha's civil unrest. His trial quickly became a focal point of national debate regarding gun rights, vigilantism, and the escalating tensions in protests across the country.

Judge Schroeder's choices throughout the trial, particularly the jury selection method, mirror the broader issues at stake: questions of fairness, the appearance of justice, and the complexities of managing high-profile cases with intense public scrutiny. As the trial progresses, the decisions from the bench continue to shape perceptions of the judicial process, underscoring the balancing act judges face in ensuring a fair trial amidst unprecedented circumstances.
