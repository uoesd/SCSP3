President Biden Addresses the Nation on the Afghanistan Evacuation Effort

In a pivotal address from the White House, President Joe Biden outlined the ongoing efforts and significant strides taken in the massive undertaking of evacuating American citizens, third-country nationals, Afghan allies, and vulnerable Afghans amidst the turbulent situation in Afghanistan. The President's speech comes at a critical moment as the world watches the evolving crisis following the Taliban's swift resurgence.

Since my last update to the American people and the international community, substantial progress has been made in our mission to ensure the safe evacuation of thousands from Afghanistan. Thanks to the round-the-clock efforts of our military and diplomatic personnel, the Kabul airport has been secured, allowing flights to resume in what can only be described as one of the largest and most difficult airlifts in history.

With nearly 6,000 American troops now on the ground to facilitate this historic operation, their dedication and bravery have been nothing short of exemplary. Their presence has made it possible to accelerate the pace of evacuations, ensuring that we can bring our citizens and allies to safety with relentless resolve.

I would like to share with the nation and the world that since the beginning of July, we have successfully evacuated over 18,000 people from Afghanistan, with approximately 13,000 of those evacuations occurring since the military airlift operation commenced on August 14. The scale and speed of this evacuation process underscore the complex logistical and operational challenge that our teams are overcoming day by day.

Among those we've managed to evacuate are American citizens, permanent residents and their families, Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, and other vulnerable Afghans who have stood by us throughout the years. Their safety and well-being continue to be our priority as we navigate these challenging times.

A notable success in our evacuation effort has been the safe transfer of all 204 employees of prominent American news outlets, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. Their safety is a testament to the unwavering commitment of our teams on the ground and the importance we place on the freedom of the press.

Our evacuation efforts have not been without their hurdles. Flights out of Kabul were briefly paused to allow the receiving bases to process the large number of evacuees arriving. These operations have since resumed, with renewed vigor, as we work tirelessly to uphold our commitment to those in need of safe passage.

In addition to our own nationals, the United States is facilitating flights for Allies and partners, ensuring that we stand together in this monumental task. Our coordination with NATO and operational partners has been paramount in orchestrating one of the most complex airlifts in modern history.

I must impress upon everyone that the evacuation mission carries inherent danger. The situation on the ground is fluid, and while we are making every effort to ensure the safety of those we are evacuating, we cannot guarantee that this operation will be devoid of loss. These are the harsh realities of rescue missions in such volatile environments.

In spite of these challenges, our commitment remains unwavering. We will continue to evacuate American citizens who wish to leave, along with Afghan allies and partners who have been invaluable in our efforts over the years. Our operations are continuous, with teams working tirelessly to coordinate safe passage to the airport, even amidst operational challenges and the need to navigate our interactions with the Taliban carefully.

In closing, I want to assure Americans and our allies around the world that the United States is fully committed to this mission. We will spare no effort to bring our people and our Afghan partners to safety. This operation exemplifies the best of American leadership on the world stage, and I am incredibly proud of the dedication and humanity displayed by our service members and diplomatic personnel.

To those still in harm's way, know that we are with you, and we are working day and night to ensure your safe return. Together, we face these challenges with resilience and determination, upholding our values and commitments to human dignity and freedom.
