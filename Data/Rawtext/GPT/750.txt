Safety Concerns and Misconduct Claims Plague 'Rust' Assistant Director

CNN – Dave Halls, the assistant director involved in the tragic 'Rust' film set shooting that resulted in cinematographer Halyna Hutchins' death, is facing intense scrutiny over past behavior on set, including ignoring safety protocols and allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct. Detailed complaints from previous productions in 2019 paint a concerning picture of Halls' professional conduct.

As the individual who handed Alec Baldwin the prop firearm that killed Hutchins, Halls' adherence to safety measures has been questioned. Further complicating this narrative are accounts from a variety of crew members, including Maggie Goll, a prop maker and licensed pyrotechnician, who spoke out about her personal experiences working with Halls.

Goll described a pattern of negligence on Halls' part, alleging that he routinely disregarded the necessity of safety meetings, especially when firearms were involved. "There was a noted lack of safety meetings and announcements when firearms were present on my set," said Goll, painting a picture of a professional environment where protocol was often ignored.

She also accused Halls of failing to maintain basic safety measures, such as clear fire lanes and exits, and of pushing forward with filming during unsafe weather conditions. This disregard for protocol reportedly created an environment rife with unnecessary risks for the cast and crew.

One particularly troubling incident involved a licensed pyrotechnician experiencing a medical emergency on set. According to Goll, Halls proposed continuing the shoot, blatantly disregarding the serious safety concerns at play. This decision was met with shock and disbelief by those present.

A crew member, speaking on the condition of anonymity, corroborated Goll's account. This person indicated that Halls often appeared disinterested during safety briefings and was resistant to having firearms inspected by the appropriate authorities.

Goll's claims extend beyond safety issues to include allegations of sexual misconduct. She accused Halls of being overly familiar in a way that bordered on inappropriate with various crew members. This behavior, Goll suggested, contributed to an uncomfortable and unprofessional atmosphere on set.

Despite these serious allegations, Goll said that when she reported Halls' behavior internally and to the Directors Guild of America, she saw no subsequent action taken against him. This lack of response raises questions about the efficacy of mechanisms in place to protect workers in the entertainment industry.

The consequences of the alleged negligence came to a tragic head with the death of Halyna Hutchins. That incident, still under investigation, has prompted a wider discussion regarding safety standards and practices on film sets.

Goll's outspoken criticism of Halls suggests a systemic problem that goes beyond a single incident. She expressed a broader concern for the safety and well-being of film crew members, emphasizing the importance of strict adherence to established safety protocols.

Halls' history, as described by those who have worked with him, underscores the challenges the film industry faces in ensuring safe working environments. These challenges are compounded by allegations of sexual misconduct, which introduce an additional layer of complexity to the ongoing dialogue surrounding workplace safety and conduct.

The implications of these accusations stretch far beyond the 'Rust' set, inviting scrutiny of industry-wide practices. As the investigation into Hutchins' death continues, so too does the conversation about how to best protect those who work in the uniquely demanding world of film production.

In response to inquiries, representatives for Dave Halls have not yet provided comment.

The film industry, often celebrated for its creativity and innovation, now finds itself at a crossroads, confronting urgent questions about safety, responsibility, and the culture within which it operates. The tragic loss of Hutchins, combined with the detailed allegations against Halls, serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with negligence and misconduct.

As Goll and other concerned industry professionals continue to speak out, the hope is that meaningful change can be enacted to prevent future tragedies. The path forward is uncertain, but the need for accountability and reform is clear.
