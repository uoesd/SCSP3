Daniel Goldman Announces Candidacy for New York Attorney General, Pledges to Combat Threats to Democracy

In a significant move that could shape the future of New York's legal landscape, Daniel Goldman, a former federal prosecutor and counsel to House Democrats during President Trump's first impeachment trial, has officially entered the race for New York Attorney General. Goldman announced his candidacy with a promise to counteract what he sees as persistent attacks on democracy, specifically calling out the continuing threat posed by "Trumpism."

"The very fabric of our democracy is under assault, and the rule of law must be our shield and sword. I'm running for Attorney General to safeguard our rights and to ensure equal justice under the law," stated Goldman during his campaign kick-off. He emphasized his dedication to civil rights, equal justice, and the preservation of democratic values as key drivers of his decision to run.

Goldman steps into a potentially crowded field, with figures such as Zephyr Teachout and state Sen. Shelley Mayer also eyeing the AG post. His campaign is set to focus on critical issues including voting rights, reproductive rights, and the fight against climate change, highlighting the statewide and national significance of the role.

The candidate underscored the unique authority and national relevance of the New York Attorney General's Office, viewing it as a vital platform from which to address systemic challenges and uphold democratic principles. "This office has the power and the mandate to confront injustices that not only affect New Yorkers but also have far-reaching implications across the country," Goldman remarked.

Goldman made it clear that he is not looking to use the AG position as a stepping stone for higher political ambitions. "I am committed to being the people's lawyer, focusing solely on defending the interests of the public and the principles that underpin our society," he asserted.

Before venturing into politics, Goldman had an impressive 10-year tenure as a federal prosecutor, tackling organized crime and securities fraud, which speaks to his robust experience and dedication to law enforcement. His roles in significant legal and political battles have solidified his reputation as a staunch defender of civil rights and an advocate for criminal justice reform.

At 45 years old, Goldman comes to the race with an extensive background in history and law, holding degrees from Yale and Stanford. Married and a father to five children, he resides in Manhattan, grounding him in the community he aims to serve. His candidacy promises a campaign deeply rooted in a commitment to justice, equality, and the defense of democratic values that will undoubtedly shape the discourse in the race for New York Attorney General.
