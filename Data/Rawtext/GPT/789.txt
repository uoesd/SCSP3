Biden Proposes $1.9 Trillion 'Rescue Plan' Including $1,400 Direct Payments to Americans

In a bold move to combat the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled a sweeping $1.9 trillion 'rescue plan' aimed at revitalizing the struggling U.S. economy. Central to Biden's proposal is an additional $1,400 in direct payments to Americans, supplementing the $600 already distributed in the latest relief package, to total a $2,000 cash relief effort.

"The crisis of human suffering is in plain sight, and there's no time to waste," Biden declared. "We have to act, and we have to act now. This is not just about numbers; this is about people's lives."

Allocating $465 billion of the plan's massive budget for direct payments evidences the administration's commitment to providing substantial financial aid directly to American households. This additional $1,400 payment extends eligibility to all dependents, including college students and disabled adults, broadening the scope of assistance beyond those under 17 years old in previous rounds.

The structure for disbursing these payments will likely mirror the eligibility criteria used for the current $600 stimulus checks. Individuals with an adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeding $75,000, and married couples with an AGI over $150,000, would see their payments gradually decrease, adjusted according to the number of dependents.

Eligibility for the payments will be based on taxpayers' most recent returns, with the IRS utilizing 2019 tax data for the second round of checks. This approach aims to ensure that the aid reaches those in greatest need without delay.

Economists highlight the profound impact of Biden's proposal on America's lowest earners. The additional $2,000 checks would spike the income of the lowest 20% of households by an impressive 29%. For comparison, the previous $600 payment resulted in an 8% income increase for this group, while the $1,200 payments issued under the CARES Act saw an 11% rise.

President-elect Biden's ambitious plan emerges as a critical step toward supporting millions of Americans facing financial hardship, providing a much-needed boost to the economy, and ultimately facilitating the nation's recovery from the ongoing pandemic crisis. With broad implications for income distribution and economic stability, the proposed rescue plan sets a hopeful trajectory for Biden's incoming administration.
