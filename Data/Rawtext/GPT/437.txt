Prince Harry Cites British Press Impact on Mental Health as Reason for Royal Exit

LOS ANGELES – In an unfolding narrative that has captivated both sides of the Atlantic, Prince Harry has cited the relentless negative coverage by the British press as a significant factor in his decision to depart from royal life. The Duke of Sussex's candid revelations have come through a series of media engagements, marking a new chapter for him and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, away from the strictures of Buckingham Palace.

January 2020 marked a seismic shift in the British royal establishment as Harry and Meghan announced their intention to step back from royal duties. This decision plunged the royal family into a crisis, challenging centuries-old traditions and prompting discussions about the future of the monarchy.

Buckingham Palace has since confirmed that the couple will not be returning as working members of the royal family. With this confirmation, Harry will relinquish his honorary military titles, a move that has drawn widespread attention and sparked debates about tradition, duty, and personal freedom.

The Sussexes have relocated to Los Angeles, where they have found a more favorable reception, engaging with media figures who are often seen as more sympathetic to their cause. Their media interactions have included a notable appearance by Prince Harry on James Corden's show, providing a lighter, more personal glimpse into his life outside the royal framework.

This interaction comes ahead of a much-anticipated prime-time interview with Oprah Winfrey, expected to delve deeper into the couple's experiences and their decisions. In his conversation with Corden, Harry expressed a surprising preference for the depiction of royal life in the Netflix series "The Crown," highlighting his discomfort with the often harsh portrayal of himself and his family in the newspapers.

Adding to the narrative of their media encounters, Meghan recently won a significant privacy claim against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a personal letter she had sent to her estranged father. This legal victory emphasized the couple's ongoing struggle with certain segments of the British press.

Despite stepping back from royal duties, Harry and Meghan have been adamant that their actions do not signify an abandonment of public service. They continue to engage in charitable work and use their platform to address social issues.

In a more personal revelation, Harry shared details of his family life, including regular Zoom calls with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, and disclosed that "Arch" – referencing the couple's son, Archie – was his first word. These tidbits offer a rare glimpse into the private world beyond their public personas.

Amidst these developments, the Sussexes announced they are expecting a second child. This news has further heightened interest in their lives following their departure from royal duties, as they carve out a new path that seeks to balance privacy, public service, and personal health.
