New Witness Claims to Have Given Brian Laundrie a Ride in Wyoming Amid Gabby Petito Disappearance

NEW YORK (WABC) – A startling new development has emerged in the mysterious case of Gabby Petito's disappearance. A woman appeared on 'Good Morning America' claiming that she had given a ride to Brian Laundrie in Wyoming, detailed an encounter that adds another layer to the unfolding narrative.

Miranda Baker shared her story on the national morning show, stating that she picked Laundrie up on August 29, a significant timeline detail as it came four days after Gabby Petito last communicated with her family. According to Baker, Laundrie informed her that he had been camping by himself while Petito was busy working on their shared social media content.

Their interaction took an abrupt turn when Laundrie realized that Baker was heading towards Jackson Hole. He quickly exited the vehicle and vanished from Baker's sight, leaving her puzzled by the sudden departure.

The situation concerning Petito has taken a grim turn as the FBI recently announced the discovery of a body in Grand Teton National Park. The remains, though not officially confirmed, match the description of Gabby Petito, intensifying the mystery surrounding her whereabouts.

The news has resonated deeply, with the Laundrie family's attorney commenting on the heart-wrenching developments, stating, "The news about Gabby Petito is heartbreaking. The Laundrie family prays for Gabby and her family."

Brian Laundrie, meanwhile, remains elusive, last seen by his family members in Florida. Authorities have been scouring the Carlton Reserve in Sarasota County, Florida, in hopes of locating him.

Further intensifying public interest is the release of body camera footage by police in Moab, showing an encounter between the couple. The footage adds context to their relationship dynamics and has spurred widespread media coverage.
