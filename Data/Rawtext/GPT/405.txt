George Floyd Case: Prosecution Asserts Chauvin Kneeled for Over 9 Minutes

CNN – In a significant clarification in one of the most closely watched trials of the decade, former Officer Derek Chauvin was revealed to have kneeled on George Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds, correcting the previously believed duration of 8 minutes and 46 seconds. This revelation came during the opening statements of the trial, where prosecuting attorney Jerry Blackwell emphasized the importance of this timing in establishing the cruelty and negligence that led to Floyd's death.

"The precise time, 9 minutes and 29 seconds, is essential for understanding the suffering George Floyd endured under Officer Chauvin's knee," Blackwell asserted, underlining the distress and eventual non-responsiveness Floyd showed throughout the incident.

This longer duration, divided into three phases by the prosecution, paints a detailed picture of Floyd's deteriorating condition—a factor central to the case against Chauvin. Despite the new timing, Chauvin's defense lawyer, Eric Nelson, conceded to the revised figure. However, Nelson argued that the extended duration supports the defense's narrative that the use of force was a direct response to Floyd's resistance and the surrounding circumstances, rather than an act of unabashed brutality.

"This timing, 9 minutes and 29 seconds, far from undermining our case, actually provides a clearer context for understanding the events leading up to George Floyd's tragic death," Nelson remarked, indicating the defense's strategy to frame the incident within a broader context of lawful policing gone awry.

Despite the legal significance of the adjustment, the alteration of timing from 8:46 to 9:29 became less about the numerical difference and more about the weight of extensive evidence presented. Initially, 8:46 had emerged as a powerful symbol of police brutality, inspiring worldwide protests, moments of silence, and an array of creative expressions denouncing racial injustice and police violence.

This earlier timing has been widely commemorated, even by Floyd's own family, in various demonstrations and tributes. Its cultural impact remains immense, despite the Hennepin County Attorney's Office's subsequent corrections to the record.

The initial discrepancy in reporting the accurate duration of Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck was attributed to the way in which the viral bystander video was publicized. Early accounts relied on the pressing immediacy of the video, leading to the initial 8:46 time stamp.

The trial continues to unfold, with both the prosecution and defense painstakingly dissecting each moment of the newly confirmed 9 minutes and 29 seconds. The length of time Chauvin's knee was on Floyd's neck remains at the heart of the case, a clear focal point in understanding the degree of force applied and the human cost it exacted.

As the proceedings advance, the debate may shift and turn on numerous legal and evidentiary matters, yet the fundamental truth remains unchanged: for 9 minutes and 29 seconds, George Floyd was subjected to a restraint that ultimately led to his death. This case, symbolic of the larger struggle against police brutality and racial injustice, continues to hold the world's attention, promising to cast a long shadow on law enforcement practices and the demands for systemic change.
