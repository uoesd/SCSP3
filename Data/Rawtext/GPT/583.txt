U.S. Ends Its Longest War: Troops Exit Afghanistan

Aug 30 (Reuters) – Nearly two decades after the United States first set foot in Afghanistan, triggered by the devastating attacks of September 11, 2001, the last of its troops left the country on August 30, 2021, closing the chapter on America's longest war. The exit marks not just an end but a reflection on a series of pivotal moments that shaped U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, leading to this consequential day.

The genesis of the U.S. presence in Afghanistan was rooted in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Orchestrated by al Qaeda from Afghanistan, where they were harbored by the ruling Taliban, these attacks prompted an immediate response. On October 7, 2001, the U.S. launched its first airstrikes against Taliban and al Qaeda targets, signaling the start of a conflict that would evolve immensely over the next 20 years.

One of the early turning points of the war was in December 2001, when Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind 9/11 and then leader of al Qaeda, narrowly escaped U.S. bombing in the rugged terrains of Tora Bora, Afghanistan. His escape to Pakistan was a significant moment, underlining the difficulties and complexities the U.S. military would face in the region.

By May 2, 2003, the U.S. had declared major combat operations over, shifting its focus significantly towards Iraq. This pivot allowed the Taliban, which had been ousted from power, to regroup and gradually regain strength, leading to a resurgence that would challenge U.S. and NATO forces for years to come.

Acknowledging the resurgent Taliban and the deteriorating situation, President Obama, on February 17, 2009, made the decision to increase U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan. This surge saw troop numbers exceeding 100,000 in 2010, aimed at counter-insurgency operations and to stabilize the precarious situation.

A pivotal moment came on May 1, 2011, when U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, more than a decade after the 9/11 attacks. This event was seen as a significant blow to al Qaeda and a moment of justice for the United States.

In response to the evolving dynamics on the ground, President Obama, on May 27, 2014, initiated a drawdown of U.S. forces, transitioning the primary role from combat to training and supporting the Afghan military, with plans for a complete withdrawal by the end of 2016.

The path to withdrawal took a more definitive shape under the Trump administration. On February 29, 2020, an agreement was signed with the Taliban, outlining the conditions for a U.S. troop withdrawal and the beginning of intra-Afghan peace negotiations.

However, the lead-up to the final withdrawal was marred by tragedy. On August 26, 2021, an ISIS suicide bomb attack at Kabul airport claimed the lives of scores, including 13 U.S. troops, underscoring the volatile and unpredictable nature of Afghanistan's security landscape.

In an official statement marking the end of the military mission in Afghanistan, U.S. General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, declared, "Tonight's withdrawal signifies both the end of the military component of the evacuation but also the end of the nearly 20-year mission that began in Afghanistan shortly after September 11, 2001."

As the United States turns the page on this chapter of its military history, the impact of its longest war - on both the Afghan population and American service members, their families, and the nation - will be felt for generations to come. The departure of the last U.S. troops does not just mark an end but also opens a new, uncertain chapter for Afghanistan amid fears of a Taliban resurgence and the future of its people's rights and freedoms hanging in the balance.
