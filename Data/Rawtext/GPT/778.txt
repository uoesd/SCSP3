Tragedy Strikes 'Rust' Set Amid Safety Concerns, Union Members Depart

In a somber turn of events, union crew members walked off the set of the Western movie "Rust" hours before a tragic incident that claimed the life of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, involving actor Alec Baldwin. A text message obtained by The Post points to "poor gun safety" as one of the pivotal reasons behind the walkout, highlighting a series of safety and management concerns that plagued the production.

The grievances extended beyond gun safety to include dissatisfaction with accommodations, COVID-19 protocol adherence, and an overarching neglect of general safety measures. Prior to their departure, the crew submitted resignation letters, documenting not only their safety apprehensions but also issues surrounding delays in payment.

Halyna Hutchins, the 42-year-old cinematographer who tragically lost her life in the incident, was among the few who elected to continue working on the set post-walkout. Colleagues recall Hutchins being an advocate for better safety practices during her final days, striving for improvements that might have mitigated the unfortunate circumstances leading to her untimely demise.

In response to the walkout, production sought to fill the void left by the union workers, inviting non-union members to join the team. This decision came amidst a backdrop of tension and dissatisfaction with the prevailing working conditions. Notably, the prop gun that discharged, leading to Hutchins' death, had reportedly misfired on more than one occasion in the days leading up to the fatal incident, raising further questions about the efficacy of safety protocols on set.

The prop master, a recent addition to the 'Rust' crew amidst ongoing protests over safety conditions, is now under scrutiny. The individual's experience and handling of the weaponry integral to the production's authenticity are points of concern.

Efforts to reach the Santa Fe police for commentary on the incident have been met with silence, leaving a community in mourning and an industry grappling with the ramifications of the tragedy. As investigations continue, the film industry is reminded of the paramount importance of safety standards and the irreversible consequences of their neglect.
