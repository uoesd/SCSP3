Kamala Harris Awaits Move Into Official Residence Amid Prolonged Renovations

CNN – More than two months after her trailblazing inauguration as the first woman and first woman of color to serve as vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, find themselves in an unusual predicament. They are still living out of suitcases at Blair House, the president's official guesthouse, due to ongoing renovations at the vice president's residence, leaving both Harris and those following her historic journey in suspense.

The vice president's official residence, a sprawling 9,000-plus square feet mansion built in 1893, is no stranger to renovations and refurbishments, which are often substantial projects involving significant government contracts. However, the precise reason behind the current delay remains unclear, a situation reportedly fueling frustration for Vice President Harris. Among the rumored requests from Harris were updates to the mansion's kitchen, although this was later clarified by Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh, who stated, "No such work is being conducted."

Sabrina Singh further commented on the situation, emphasizing the importance of ensuring the residence fully meets the vice president's needs. "We want to make sure the Vice President's residence is not just functional, but also comfortable for the Vice President and Mr. Emhoff as they make history," Singh remarked, underlining the administration's efforts to navigate the unexpected delay with grace and patience.

The temporary accommodations at Blair House, while luxurious and steeped in history, lack the casual and informal atmosphere that Harris and Emhoff prefer for their personal time. Elizabeth Haenle, a former Vice President Residence Manager and Social Secretary for Former Vice President Dick Cheney, shed light on the appeal of the official residence over Blair House. "The vice president's residence offers a level of privacy, fewer staff, and less formality that cannot be matched by Blair House. It's a space that can truly become a home," Haenle explained, highlighting the unique advantages awaiting Harris and Emhoff once the renovations are complete.

Previous occupants of the vice presidential residence have taken the opportunity to imprint their personal style and preferences on the property, from installing a heated pool to constructing a horseshoe pit. Harris, known for her love of fitness and cooking, is anticipated to bring her distinct flair to the residence, especially appreciating the outdoor space for exercise and perhaps even adding personal touches to make the historic domicile her own.

As the wait for the completion of the renovations extends, the anticipation grows not only for Harris and Emhoff but also for the nation eager to see how the vice president will utilize and personalize her new residence. The symbolic and functional significance of the vice president's home, combined with Harris's historic tenure, makes the eventual move a moment of both personal and national importance.
