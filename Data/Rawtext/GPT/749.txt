Shannon Lee Calls for Mandatory Gun Safety Training on Film Sets After Rust Incident

In the wake of the tragic shooting on the set of "Rust," Shannon Lee, the sister of the late Brandon Lee who died under similar circumstances, is advocating for mandatory gun safety training on film sets. This push for heightened safety protocols comes nearly three decades after Brandon Lee was killed on the set of "The Crow" in 1993, a death that echoed through the entertainment industry and beyond.

Shannon Lee, deeply affected by her brother's death and now the recent incident involving Alec Baldwin accidentally killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, believes it's time for the industry to take decisive action. "Actors should have the knowledge and ability to check guns themselves," Lee stated, stressing the importance of safety and the active role everyone on set should play in ensuring it. "This can help prevent tragic accidents and make everyone more comfortable and confident while working with firearms on set."

The parallels between the deaths of Hutchins and Brandon Lee are stark reminders of the dangers that can arise when handling firearms during production. In both instances, the individuals involved believed the guns were safe and loaded with blanks, not live ammunition. Brandon Lee's fiancée, Eliza Hutton, described the "Rust" incident as "another avoidable tragedy," further emphasizing the need for change. "It's heartbreaking that after nearly 30 years, we are seeing a repeat of this kind of incident. The industry must consider serious alternatives to using real guns on set," Hutton remarked.

In light of the tragic events, Shannon Lee has also extended her sympathy to Alec Baldwin, acknowledging the unforeseen burden carried by those involved in such accidents. "It's a heavy weight to bear, and my heart goes out to Alec and everyone affected by this tragedy," she added.

Baldwin, who has been in contact with Hutchins' family, has publicly expressed his concern and support for them during this difficult time. "My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna," Baldwin said in a statement shortly after the incident.

The shooting occurred on Oct. 21, during a rehearsal on the "Rust" set in New Mexico. Baldwin was holding a gun that was supposed to be safe but discharged a real bullet, striking and killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.

This tragic event has reignited a conversation about on-set safety protocols, particularly regarding the use of firearms. The film industry has historically relied on a combination of real and prop firearms for filming. However, this incident underscores the potential risks and calls into question the necessity of using real guns, especially in an era where digital effects can convincingly replicate gunshots and muzzle flashes.

The investigation into the "Rust" shooting is ongoing, and authorities have stated that "all options are on the table" concerning charges, although none have been filed yet. The film industry and its approach to safety are at a potential turning point, with calls for change growing louder.

Brandon Lee's death marked a before and after in how firearms are managed on set, but the accident on the "Rust" set shows more improvements are necessary. With Shannon Lee and Eliza Hutton leading the discourse, there's a renewed hope that their calls for mandatory gun safety training and reconsideration of using real guns on set will prevent any further tragedies of this nature.
