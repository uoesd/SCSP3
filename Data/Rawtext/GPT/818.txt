Americans Wave Goodbye to Stimulus Checks as 2021 Closes

BALTIMORE (WBFF/WKRC) – As the final days of 2021 draw to a close, Americans are bidding farewell to the stimulus check payments that were part of the American Rescue Plan, marking a significant chapter in the government's effort to stabilize the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan, which has provided $1,400 payments to most Americans along with expanded Child Tax Credit benefits, has been a critical source of financial support for many throughout the challenging year.

The 2021 stimulus checks, aimed at bolstering the economy and providing direct relief to individuals and families, were a lifeline for millions. However, as the calendar flips to 2022, there are no plans in place to continue the monthly child tax credit payments that have supported so many families with children throughout the past year.

In a continued effort to provide support where it's needed most, the IRS is issuing "plus-up" payments to some families based on changes observed in their 2020 tax filings. These changes, which include a decrease in income or the addition of a child in the family, are triggering additional relief for those who qualify.

The criteria for receiving these Economic Impact Payments are clear: individuals making $75,000 or less, as well as married couples with a combined income of $150,000 or less, are eligible. The IRS is tasked with sending out these "plus-up" payments until December 31, operating under a strict legislative deadline to provide this additional support.

Despite the conclusion of the stimulus checks and monthly child tax credit payments, Democrats remain committed to extending the Child Tax Credit into 2022. This push comes with a hefty price tag, with a one-year extension of the credit estimated to cost $185 billion, while a ten-year extension would amount to a staggering $1.6 trillion.

The debate over extending the Child Tax Credit underscores the ongoing discussion about the best ways to support American families and stimulate the economy in the wake of the pandemic. As discussions continue amongst lawmakers, the close of 2021 brings with it a period of uncertainty for many, highlighting the ever-present importance of governmental support in times of crisis.
